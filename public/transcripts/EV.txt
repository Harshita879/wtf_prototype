00:00:00.280 so the point of today is to talk about
00:00:04.080 electric vehicles anybody new looking to
00:00:07.200 get into the industry we want to tell
00:00:09.800 them the good the bad the
00:00:12.040 [Music]
00:00:18.630 [Music]
00:00:24.240 ugly ready
00:00:28.960 rolling
00:00:32.800 uh hi guys thank you for coming to
00:00:35.000 Bangalore and uh thanks to my friends
00:00:37.280 who are already in Bangalore so the
00:00:39.200 point of today is to talk about electric
00:00:43.079 vehicles in the manner that anybody new
00:00:47.079 looking to get into the industry after
00:00:49.680 college or someone who wants to start a
00:00:52.960 business in Eevee a young entrepreneur
00:00:56.239 we want to tell them the good the bad
00:00:59.000 the ugly
00:01:00.559 uh which part of the industry what may
00:01:03.320 it make sense for them to focus on and
00:01:06.080 what are the skill sets they might need
00:01:08.040 to inculcate to have a long career good
00:01:10.080 career in this
00:01:11.840 industry so maybe we can start with
00:01:16.240 introductions uh I'm sure many people
00:01:18.479 know all of you but uh let's start with
00:01:21.840 Punit so I was born and Broad of in
00:01:24.159 Kolkata and I um did my schooling there
00:01:28.159 um I'm born in 84 so I'm 39 um shifted
00:01:32.799 to Bombay in the year 2000 uh went to
00:01:35.040 syum college for my graduation where is
00:01:37.680 that uh syam with in Bombay um Church
00:01:40.159 gate B Road um then I finished my
00:01:42.759 graduation in
00:01:44.079 2005 um then went to London School of
00:01:46.280 Economics for my masters in finance uh
00:01:48.320 did a year of MSE in finance there
00:01:51.680 didn't want to come back to India and um
00:01:53.560 so studied one more year went to Aston
00:01:55.439 business school for my second Masters um
00:01:58.000 so while I was there there studying at
00:02:00.560 Aston business school so you did two
00:02:02.320 masters in yeah in UK yeah one in London
00:02:04.640 one in Birmingham um are you married do
00:02:07.880 you have a girlfriend okay I didn't I
00:02:10.758 was not focused on girls yeah what were
00:02:13.760 you focused on maybe just uh trying to
00:02:16.480 find my way out figuring how to start a
00:02:18.360 business or something have things
00:02:19.599 changed at
00:02:20.680 39 how is this not an
00:02:23.680 interview feel like
00:02:26.160 that they changed little bit um I come
00:02:30.280 from a family business background so my
00:02:32.840 you know third generation entrepreneur
00:02:34.760 everybody was doing something in the
00:02:35.879 family so I didn't want to join my
00:02:38.080 family business and was wanting to start
00:02:40.400 on my own so I was trying to figure out
00:02:41.800 what to do I did two or three small
00:02:43.400 startups which didn't go along well they
00:02:45.440 were in the plastic space small very
00:02:47.040 small startups uh that didn't go along
00:02:49.680 well so I yeah so I decided that I'll go
00:02:53.480 study outside let's probably learn
00:02:55.440 something and while I was studying at um
00:02:58.400 at Aston I chanced upon during my
00:03:01.680 disertation I read about the role of
00:03:04.360 clean energy and renewable energy that
00:03:06.239 will be that was game changing for me
00:03:08.799 and I came back to India and I met some
00:03:10.440 solar panel manufacturers who at that
00:03:12.159 time were manufacturing solar panels uh
00:03:14.239 met them in India and realized that
00:03:16.480 there could be a massive opportunity to
00:03:18.480 make solar panels in India and Export
00:03:20.080 into Europe Europe at that time was the
00:03:21.519 biggest Market uh they were setting up
00:03:23.480 these massive solar power plans in Spain
00:03:25.200 and Italy they had that fit feeding
00:03:26.920 tariff so I then decided that we'll set
00:03:29.360 up us solar panel manufacturing facility
00:03:31.280 it was called plg Power my first company
00:03:33.080 plg is the initials of my grandfather
00:03:34.439 Pam L goyel he passed away uh in April
00:03:37.599 2007 at the age of 78 so I thought okay
00:03:40.439 my first company that I'll I'll start
00:03:42.760 should be with his initials and I
00:03:44.959 started that in 2007 8 uh J of 2008 to
00:03:49.120 manufacture solar panels the
00:03:51.080 manufacturing facility was at nashik at
00:03:53.120 CER so that was the whole idea to make
00:03:55.079 solar panels so did that for four years
00:03:57.720 uh between 2008 to 2012 12 uh the idea
00:04:01.599 was to go back into solar cell
00:04:03.760 manufacturing uh further back into wafer
00:04:05.959 manufacturing and each was a larger
00:04:08.040 investment but then the market just
00:04:10.599 crashed in Europe it was very bad timing
00:04:13.840 Market just came down you know string of
00:04:15.920 bankruptcies in in market for uh for
00:04:18.440 solar panels nobody anticipated that and
00:04:21.160 people were ramping up capacities for
00:04:22.880 supplying panels and cells to Europe and
00:04:25.160 we were also ramping up capacity the
00:04:26.960 market just kind of crashed in 2 years
00:04:28.759 between 11 to
00:04:30.160 and I also had not anticipated that um
00:04:33.440 and so that it took a big beating I had
00:04:35.120 to shut down my first startup after
00:04:37.120 achieving that you know that kind of
00:04:40.320 manufacturing capacity mentally I was
00:04:42.240 also very you R this with your family
00:04:44.120 just myself and big lesson learned I
00:04:46.160 didn't have any co-founder at that time
00:04:48.639 U just by myself from it with some
00:04:50.280 liquidity yeah so I raised Bank funding
00:04:52.919 U raised some private Equity from the
00:04:54.560 market from friends and family initial
00:04:56.000 Capital then went out to raise some
00:04:57.199 Equity we needed a large working capital
00:04:59.120 we had about 150 Kos of working capital
00:05:01.400 at that time uh to buy the material
00:05:03.800 stock it sell it and all that but anyway
00:05:06.680 so that uh the first Venture shutdown I
00:05:09.880 which year was this 2012 1112 and so I
00:05:13.440 took a big beating there uh and I
00:05:16.080 realize that you know manufacturing is
00:05:17.720 tough it's not everybody's cup of tea to
00:05:19.400 do uh and I not anticipate that this
00:05:22.160 will happen overnight also but yeah so
00:05:24.960 God shuts one door opens another at that
00:05:26.960 time government of Gujarat came out with
00:05:28.280 a solar policy um in Gujarat and U they
00:05:31.919 allowed people to set up solar power
00:05:33.560 plants we signed a 40 Mega Power PES
00:05:35.440 agreement with government of Gujarat and
00:05:37.280 we set up a 20 Mega Power Plant uh so we
00:05:39.720 built that project operated for two
00:05:41.360 years and then sold it to a large Saudi
00:05:44.800 uh company that was looking to buy an
00:05:46.680 operating asset in India for a sum of
00:05:49.880 $68 million and so that was kind of a
00:05:53.160 good project and that's when I met my
00:05:54.479 co-founder anal jagi uh anol is a
00:05:57.440 founder of jol uh at that time gen Sol
00:05:59.919 was building many solar power plants uh
00:06:02.000 the solar policy was about 300 so they
00:06:03.880 were building nearly half of that
00:06:05.319 capacity design engineering EPC they
00:06:07.800 were doing various stuff so I met ano
00:06:10.199 and anmol's Company did the entire EPC
00:06:12.360 jol did that 20 me power PL they build
00:06:14.880 inard time of about four months so we
00:06:16.800 became friends um and that's how I first
00:06:19.680 met him I had no idea that we'll start
00:06:21.639 blue smart probably eight years later uh
00:06:24.319 so that was my second Venture and um and
00:06:27.199 I took a break of a year for a year my
00:06:28.800 wife was studying in the US at uh in
00:06:30.720 Borton so a lot of back and forth wa
00:06:33.759 you're married yeah why wouldn't you say
00:06:35.919 that when I was badgering you with all I
00:06:39.919 thought you did make us all feel like
00:06:42.720 start of still out of the oh really okay
00:06:46.000 I'm looking at you from a different
00:06:47.199 light now okay really oh nice for a
00:06:50.319 second I was like wait what is going on
00:06:52.000 here it was an absolute twist
00:06:55.080 okay okay then you started blue smart
00:06:58.440 what is blue smart yeah so after my
00:07:00.599 third Venture okay that was another
00:07:02.080 small 70 or you walked away with $68
00:07:05.000 million you had I walk it away I mean I
00:07:07.520 had to give some money back to lenders
00:07:09.360 also okay you walked away with $50
00:07:10.840 million some money uh let's keep it at
00:07:13.000 some money did you buy something nice
00:07:15.400 some money and then uh my third Venture
00:07:18.440 was another solar project uh founded plg
00:07:20.720 cleanergy projects we did a small 70
00:07:22.440 Mega solar power plant in dul marra
00:07:24.560 again and moles company jol played a
00:07:26.879 part there in cting up that power plant
00:07:28.360 also so three solar and I sold it to
00:07:31.440 sorry again sold that yeah sold that to
00:07:33.319 a large listed entity in India they also
00:07:35.280 into renewable space a very large
00:07:36.919 Renewable Energy company sslon sslon
00:07:39.039 correct yeah absolutely spot on um so so
00:07:41.680 these are three Ventures and I was kind
00:07:43.000 of done with solar and uh so you've been
00:07:45.280 making money for a long time lost money
00:07:48.039 in my first Venture tons of money third
00:07:49.840 one third one yeah third one made money
00:07:52.000 yeah how much do you sell that for for
00:07:54.039 $55 million so and then I kind of was
00:07:58.039 thinking what to do mm and uh I I had um
00:08:02.720 I met this amazing entrepreneur called
00:08:05.319 Bren kinus um I'd gone to see hyper Loop
00:08:08.879 one in Las Vegas in Nevada and I met
00:08:12.759 there Sherin pivar he was the CEO of
00:08:15.599 hyper Loop one and he was showing me
00:08:17.960 this big tunnel where you can travel
00:08:19.720 really fast in that tunnel with pods you
00:08:21.759 know they they're making these pods and
00:08:22.960 you can sit in the Pod and they traveled
00:08:24.919 really fast at Great speeds and they
00:08:26.599 were going to do it also for
00:08:28.240 Logistics somehow in the discussion uh
00:08:31.400 it a lot of solar conversations came out
00:08:33.320 because of my background and the guy on
00:08:35.279 the other side was Brent kinus he was uh
00:08:38.200 I later learned from him over dinner
00:08:40.799 that he was CFO of uber and shervin I
00:08:43.958 learned later that evening was sitting
00:08:45.480 in Malibu club and we were having dinner
00:08:47.680 in um Los Angeles uh and uh he was a
00:08:51.440 series B investor in uh in now I'm
00:08:53.480 getting a mental picture of you sold one
00:08:55.600 company for 50 million another for 70
00:08:57.880 sitting in Malibu club
00:09:00.399 I was learning from these Mavericks what
00:09:02.640 they did in their past life I like
00:09:04.360 meeting people like I'm meeting you
00:09:05.600 today I'm meeting Chan I'm meeting
00:09:07.760 another amazing e entrepreneur so okay
00:09:10.160 and then yeah so so yeah so that evening
00:09:12.279 I um learned from them that what the
00:09:15.800 world of uh Mobility could be like and
00:09:19.560 uh so shervin and um and Bren spoke a
00:09:22.959 lot about TVs in fact when we came out
00:09:24.519 of the conversation uh from that lunch
00:09:26.480 meeting and that dinner meeting that we
00:09:27.839 had we saw a charge point charging
00:09:29.440 station which was right outside the
00:09:30.959 Malibu club and it was charging a BMW I8
00:09:33.560 car and and I've seen E before at the
00:09:36.040 Stanford Shopping Center I've driven the
00:09:38.120 Tesla on around Stanford campus in 1617
00:09:41.880 but you know I was not never thinking
00:09:43.600 about e so much or the role e could play
00:09:46.600 in the future like I thought for solar
00:09:48.320 at that time so what is the big idea
00:09:49.760 with blue smart if you had to Define
00:09:51.360 blue Smart in one line yeah so so we are
00:09:53.680 building an energy infrastructure and
00:09:55.560 Mobility company intertwined connected
00:09:58.399 uh the whole idea is uh which my mentor
00:10:01.000 Brent also said that um look it's
00:10:04.079 imminent that in the future all cars
00:10:07.480 will become AVS over the next 10 20
00:10:09.560 years I mean some countries will do it
00:10:10.800 over 30 years faster countries will be
00:10:12.720 could be maybe 5 10 years medoc
00:10:14.760 countries could take still about 15 20
00:10:16.240 years the biggest challenge will be the
00:10:18.000 charging infra Challenge and that
00:10:19.760 nobody's talking about so are you
00:10:21.160 focused on the charging infra or running
00:10:23.440 a fleet of electric cars both uh
00:10:26.240 actually it's absolutely interconnected
00:10:28.120 if I take any out the entire model will
00:10:30.839 crumble and that was the whole idea if
00:10:33.079 your company has a kex of 100 that it
00:10:35.160 has done up until now how much went
00:10:37.440 towards Fleet of electric cars how much
00:10:40.360 went towards charging infra well you
00:10:42.000 need more money for charging infra
00:10:43.480 because charging infra is a direct
00:10:44.600 investment in our case if I can speak so
00:10:46.880 and do you charge only your vehicles
00:10:48.639 there or is it open for other well the
00:10:50.360 whole idea is to build the pr of
00:10:51.959 charging model I'll come there but but
00:10:54.519 initially we need all the charging for
00:10:55.959 ourselves we need to help ourselves
00:10:57.240 first but the idea the bigger idea was
00:11:00.240 to Let's create an ecosystem
00:11:02.800 interconnected where we will create
00:11:05.440 massive EV charging inra but that EV
00:11:07.959 charging will infra will be of no use if
00:11:10.399 we don't have an anchor tenant so then
00:11:12.720 we need an anchor tenant which is
00:11:14.399 in-house Anor tenant which is blue smart
00:11:16.959 Fleet which will then you utilize the
00:11:20.040 charging infra right and this charging
00:11:22.320 infra and then that creates a virtual
00:11:23.839 cycle so you create charging infra you
00:11:26.120 bring in the fleet of EVs and whyz
00:11:30.279 instead of IC right now what is the big
00:11:32.519 Advantage yeah I mean EVS have massive
00:11:34.399 advantages right so on the business side
00:11:36.399 the operating cost are super low right
00:11:38.440 so the operating cost of running EVS is
00:11:40.959 low the cost of fuel is cheaper so look
00:11:44.480 in 2018 when we were starting a blue
00:11:47.040 smart um the cost of CG in India which
00:11:50.079 was a darling fuel at that time um was
00:11:52.800 about 37 38 39 rupees a kg and that over
00:11:56.760 the next over five years uh went up to
00:12:00.079 about 86 90 rupees 95 rupees a kage now
00:12:03.160 with government subsidies again come
00:12:04.480 down between 80 90 rupees a k depending
00:12:06.839 on the city you live in and petrol and
00:12:10.160 Diesel at that time was about 72 rupees
00:12:11.959 a liter uh in 2018 cira and then that
00:12:15.160 went up to now I'm from Bombay it's
00:12:17.079 north of 105 106 rupees a liter we
00:12:20.120 always knew that that this is a game of
00:12:22.040 energy and this is not a game of
00:12:23.680 mobility and uh if you don't build in
00:12:26.920 alphabetical order energy infr Mobility
00:12:28.720 company I mean it will not make sense so
00:12:30.560 how much does it cost you today to ply 1
00:12:33.519 kilomet on your EV what vehicle do you
00:12:35.880 use I personally no blue smart blue
00:12:38.720 smart we have um a fleet of uh 5,000
00:12:42.959 plus T Tor cars and how much does it
00:12:45.279 cost you to go 1 kilometer in a data
00:12:47.160 Decor versus the equivalent model in ic
00:12:51.279 maybe something Ola uses or over years
00:12:53.399 look the operating cost could range
00:12:55.920 between and that I mean I could speak
00:12:57.839 for blue smart and for an individual
00:13:00.279 could range between you know a a rupee
00:13:02.680 20 PES per uh per um kilometer to about
00:13:08.320 maybe about 2 rupees also depending what
00:13:10.320 your charging in is like you know say
00:13:12.079 for example I give you a rough math I'll
00:13:14.440 give you example of mg car you know so
00:13:16.440 mg
00:13:17.880 today on a full charge gives you 300
00:13:20.240 plus kilometers and if you have a green
00:13:23.560 meter installed in your house with BST
00:13:25.760 in Bombay um what is a green meter I
00:13:28.959 it's a special meter that you need to
00:13:30.279 take uh Society will provide you a
00:13:32.399 different meter but they have a special
00:13:33.720 system and special tariff for EVS so if
00:13:36.639 you install is that true for me if I
00:13:38.240 have a electric car and I charge it here
00:13:40.880 I have to take a green meter and you can
00:13:42.680 I don't know about the Karnataka you
00:13:44.959 actually haven't heard of green meters
00:13:46.320 in Karnataka in Karnataka yeah you you
00:13:48.800 can uh but you don't have to the rate is
00:13:52.000 cheaper right so the rate for Electric
00:13:54.240 Mobility may be five bucks and the rate
00:13:57.079 for regular energy could be anywhere
00:13:58.600 from from seven eight bucks depending
00:14:00.399 how much energy you're using list but
00:14:01.920 for most most individual owners users it
00:14:06.399 probably will not justify the effort
00:14:08.440 because 2 rupees a kilometer is a lot no
00:14:10.680 no no a kilow Hour 2 rupes a Kil K yeah
00:14:13.880 sorry kilowatt hours yeah and how much
00:14:15.120 does that translate into per kilometer
00:14:17.759 how many kilometers you get in a
00:14:19.160 kilowatt hour of energy you th000 kilm
00:14:21.600 in a month you will spend, 1500 rupees
00:14:25.360 using a regular
00:14:26.560 meter with a green meter maybe you'll
00:14:28.800 spend 6 700 rupees I'm guessing are you
00:14:31.720 talking he's talking of a scooter what
00:14:33.480 no I'm talking about uh just kilowatt
00:14:36.000 hour car car give you
00:14:39.279 arounda 6 kilm per kilowatt hour
00:14:43.240 probably would be a good number the
00:14:45.040 range could be50 P per per kilometer
00:14:47.800 basically in short so how much is it in
00:14:50.120 ic versus Eevee today I mean today C
00:14:53.639 today is about 4 rupes 4 and a half
00:14:55.240 rupees the cost of CG went up it was
00:14:56.839 only 2 r75 p now cost cost of cngg vent
00:14:59.480 up petrol diesel today cost you about 8
00:15:01.959 rupees and IC cost you 2 rupees no no e
00:15:06.040 cost e cost e depending on what your
00:15:08.639 energy mixes what Your Capacity I mean
00:15:10.519 for blue smart it's a different scale
00:15:11.959 right so our cost is very low our scale
00:15:14.279 is much larger how much would it be for
00:15:16.079 Ola if they had a comparison cuz they
00:15:17.639 have a fleet which I mean that depends
00:15:19.399 again on the fuel they're using CNG the
00:15:21.399 driver I mean Ola is a is an app then
00:15:24.759 app but the driver if he's using petrol
00:15:27.040 or diesel and then dep on the cars in
00:15:29.519 NOA car or a small car do you own your
00:15:31.720 cars in a way yeah so so we lease all
00:15:34.639 these cars but we an obligation to pay
00:15:36.120 for the lease leas from leing from dfis
00:15:39.600 so we have secured what are dfis
00:15:41.240 development financial institutions who
00:15:42.959 fund these cars give me an example so
00:15:45.079 ITA Indian renewable energy development
00:15:47.319 agency they buye it from yeah so so we
00:15:50.079 have an SPV they they buy these cars I
00:15:52.880 mean they fund these cars that SPV takes
00:15:55.519 the loan from these large dfis and what
00:15:58.480 is is their contribution in the SPV and
00:16:00.360 what is yours so they give the loan to
00:16:02.240 that SPV and that SPV that entity will
00:16:05.360 lease cars to Blue smart we give the
00:16:07.759 deposit say the margin money for
00:16:09.920 procuring that loan ex can can you break
00:16:12.079 it down for me how much does this tataa
00:16:13.839 car car cost say the car cost say for
00:16:15.720 example say will be 13 lakhs just an
00:16:17.880 average okay I could be lower for for
00:16:20.360 said this for that car in particular
00:16:22.399 save example 12 and half 13 lakhs so we
00:16:24.560 have to give certain margin so say two
00:16:26.199 lakh rupees per car is a margin that
00:16:28.560 blue model provide okay and then the
00:16:30.600 loan is given okay and uh the money is
00:16:33.160 paid to tataa motors for the cost of the
00:16:34.720 car right and they charge you a rate of
00:16:36.440 interest on that yes so there's a yeah
00:16:38.560 so the DFI will charge the rate of
00:16:40.759 interest about for the loan it's sub 10%
00:16:43.800 it's about anybody who any young
00:16:46.399 entrepreneur who wants to start a EV car
00:16:49.319 Fleet can create this entire model on
00:16:52.040 their own yeah well it is tough to do it
00:16:54.040 also securing financing for at lastar
00:16:56.839 scale is tough I mean that was a whole
00:16:58.720 idea but these people who are lending
00:17:00.639 you the DFI which you said wouldn't they
00:17:03.120 give them as well of course they will
00:17:04.480 give they want to encourage this they
00:17:06.439 want to absolutely encourage this what
00:17:07.880 happens to the depreciation on the asset
00:17:09.760 if I'm a DFI and I'm lending you at 10%
00:17:12.720 in 5 years so that isv comes in that is
00:17:14.520 where the entity comes in so this could
00:17:16.599 be exciting with depreciation so if the
00:17:19.079 entity involved could be a renewable
00:17:20.679 energy company or in those businesses
00:17:23.079 with also profits you can also enjoy
00:17:25.240 depreciation benefits 40% depreciation
00:17:27.280 benefits of owning and leing asset right
00:17:29.440 so Deb benefits come in with the asset
00:17:32.080 owner whoever is the owner of the asset
00:17:33.919 at the end of the cycle these cars are
00:17:36.520 valueless in a manner
00:17:38.320 right valueless I wouldn't say they're
00:17:40.360 valueless I mean uh in fact the best
00:17:42.480 part about e is that it has life fun and
00:17:44.440 life two so there's life one where you
00:17:46.440 but the cost of the battery let's assume
00:17:47.919 is 60% of the cost of the vehicle not
00:17:49.880 really I mean I wouldn't say 60% it's
00:17:52.240 really more than 35 yeah it's not 60 uh
00:17:55.080 I could be say between for a car 35 40%
00:17:58.679 and and and when you exhaust life one
00:18:02.360 you can obviously replace and and Infuse
00:18:06.240 buy a battery work with the OEM or
00:18:08.600 another startup to say install new
00:18:11.640 battery that's when the beauty of EV is
00:18:13.720 coming life too because then youve
00:18:15.480 already paid for the car the body the
00:18:17.520 body is built to last for 8 to 10 years
00:18:19.200 the body uh is is built for last for 8
00:18:21.840 to 10 years the bacy needs to be changed
00:18:23.960 after four years after so if the body is
00:18:26.120 built for 10 years even if you Chang how
00:18:28.720 long is the battery built for see it
00:18:30.440 depends on utilization so for an
00:18:31.840 individual on average whose utilization
00:18:33.960 is only 600 km for BL BL I'm focusing on
00:18:38.320 somebody who can start somebody young an
00:18:40.960 entrepreneur who can start a business
00:18:42.840 such as yours so he can go to a DFI
00:18:45.559 borrow money Lee a vehicle run it at
00:18:48.919 scale at 2 rupees a kilometer but maybe
00:18:51.880 when he begins at a higher value now
00:18:55.120 what is the battery life beyond which he
00:18:56.840 has to change the vehicle and what
00:18:59.000 happens to the vehicle at the end of 5
00:19:00.960 years or 10 years yeah good so now for
00:19:03.960 blue smart our utilization is about
00:19:05.840 nearly 200 km a day um so which means in
00:19:09.440 Layman language about 6,000 kilm a month
00:19:12.320 70,000 plus kilometers a year uh you
00:19:15.320 know depends what kind of warranties or
00:19:17.120 guarantees you have negotiated with the
00:19:18.760 leasing institution or with the
00:19:20.520 manufacturer some will give you say
00:19:22.960 160,000 km some will 200 some maybe
00:19:25.440 250,000 km so your it depends how how
00:19:28.400 much can you exhaust we can utilize
00:19:31.280 between between 200 to 250,000 km in 4
00:19:34.919 years right so which means the batter is
00:19:37.000 done so you do two cycles four years
00:19:38.960 each eight years the body of the car is
00:19:40.720 gone then you have to D that again
00:19:42.120 depends how you use your car I am young
00:19:44.760 I want to start a business like Blu
00:19:46.360 smart I'm trying to figure out which DFI
00:19:49.360 do I go to how to borrow money how to
00:19:51.760 create a SV how to lease cars what
00:19:55.159 efficiencies do I build in to run a
00:19:57.200 business of
00:19:58.960 aggregating electric car like a Uber or
00:20:02.480 Ola would do yeah I mean you could start
00:20:04.559 small you may not need to go to DFI you
00:20:06.919 can go to probably smaller institutions
00:20:09.200 who are funding cars there are you know
00:20:10.960 probably platforms which are also
00:20:12.440 leasing 100 200 a cap like a DFI will
00:20:15.039 only do above a certain number I mean
00:20:16.760 they it's easier for them because the
00:20:19.039 fact that they are DFI uh they want to
00:20:21.039 give her they want to give larger loans
00:20:23.240 um or larger amounts it's easier for
00:20:25.280 them to process but there are small
00:20:27.200 institutions also who are funding 100
00:20:28.880 200 300 400 cars and I know few Fleet
00:20:31.400 aggregators who are also now buying EVs
00:20:33.880 and deploying on the platforms of Uber
00:20:36.400 or trying to start micro mini fleets for
00:20:39.280 B2B purposes uh in cities maybe one in
00:20:42.280 Bangalore could be in West Bengal
00:20:44.159 somewhere some in Bombay also um so we
00:20:48.200 have a very different mindset uh n so we
00:20:50.880 we believe that asset financing is key
00:20:53.760 for us I mean both and M and myself we
00:20:56.320 have raised tons of uh financing for
00:20:58.960 renewable energy projects so we went
00:21:00.840 back to the same institution who funded
00:21:02.320 Us in the past and we said that you've
00:21:04.559 been supporting our renewable energy
00:21:05.760 story and now it's time for you you to
00:21:08.320 support our EV uh story so is that an
00:21:11.200 opportunity too uh setting up solar
00:21:13.400 power plants today yeah of course I mean
00:21:15.799 and continues to uh also run and operate
00:21:19.720 jol which is today actually grown to a
00:21:21.840 massive uh company it builds gigawatts
00:21:25.200 of solar projects today uh and the solar
00:21:28.200 studies Just Begun um massive massive
00:21:31.400 opportunity for what is the yield on
00:21:32.840 investment if somebody were to ask
00:21:34.360 because I'm thinking running a solar
00:21:36.640 power plant is largely commoditized by
00:21:39.400 area and the amount of power you can
00:21:40.960 generate if somebody were to set up a 1
00:21:43.400 megawatt plant how much will it cost and
00:21:45.799 what kind of return would you make
00:21:47.440 depends on your oft take I mean a
00:21:49.480 megawatt plant investment could be in
00:21:51.240 the range of three to 3.25 cres and that
00:21:53.720 number has come down from 10 12 whatever
00:21:55.600 it used to be 18 cres a megawatt back
00:21:58.039 back in 2012 and came down uh when I was
00:22:01.880 setting up my project in Gujarat was 15
00:22:04.320 16 cres a me 15.5 came down further to
00:22:07.720 about 12 crores to a million dollars a
00:22:10.559 megawatt back in
00:22:12.640 2017 time 16 time further has come down
00:22:16.360 half and and how much do you yield on
00:22:18.480 that I mean depends what the off take
00:22:20.279 was so that doesn't change off take
00:22:22.360 please at the price at which you're
00:22:24.200 selling the power so today you need to
00:22:26.200 also figure out because you have
00:22:27.640 invested a certain amount uh you have to
00:22:30.039 work out the cost at which it'll become
00:22:31.919 profitable for you so you need to work
00:22:33.440 out at the cost as you want to sell who
00:22:35.000 determines what rate you sell Power it
00:22:37.120 discom does the oftaking entity does the
00:22:39.880 what is the off regulator does so they
00:22:42.320 are so so there are two ways right so
00:22:44.240 you can sell power to State like for
00:22:46.600 example in my case I sold power to
00:22:48.480 Gujarat Vias income limited we enter
00:22:50.279 into a fixed price contract for 25 years
00:22:52.799 for the first 12 years the price was X
00:22:55.400 which is 15 rupes per unit kilow hour
00:22:57.440 and then for the balance 13 years was 5
00:22:59.240 rupes per unit kilow right so it was a
00:23:01.279 fixed price contract you could also
00:23:03.240 probably do open-ended today if you
00:23:05.080 negotiate with a you know industrial
00:23:06.760 house who needs power and for power
00:23:08.520 savings can you do that can you sell not
00:23:10.480 to a discom or the government but sell
00:23:12.440 individually individually yeah for
00:23:13.960 individual complexes you have to be near
00:23:16.000 the company that you're selling to
00:23:17.279 otherwise how do you transport it no no
00:23:18.840 I mean I mean it could be near if you
00:23:20.440 have empty land let's say I buy how much
00:23:22.360 land do you need for one megawatt 4
00:23:24.279 Acres of megawatt so how much can I sell
00:23:26.039 that power for in India the lowest
00:23:28.320 bidding that happened at gigawatt level
00:23:30.559 when Sol energy corporation of India C
00:23:32.799 or ntpc do large bids for calling for
00:23:35.600 500 Mega solar investment or gigawatt
00:23:37.600 investment those bids have been hovering
00:23:39.880 around 275 P okay so typically on
00:23:42.120 average what is the yield of that 4 AC
00:23:44.120 land in three three crores
00:23:46.480 invested I mean what is the money that
00:23:48.360 you're going to make on the investment I
00:23:50.200 think about uh post tax anywhere between
00:23:53.159 18 to
00:23:54.279 19% um even today even today yeah right
00:23:58.400 and how big has blue smart gotten to
00:24:00.440 today on the 5,000 Fleet what is the top
00:24:03.600 line bottom
00:24:05.000 line so we are uh nearly
00:24:09.360 440 crores uh around AR uh we're doing a
00:24:13.520 revenue of close to 1.3 to 1.4 crores
00:24:17.159 per day Revenue um good days little
00:24:20.440 higher charging and the card put
00:24:22.880 together the r healing revenue is sub
00:24:24.559 nearly 440 450 cres per ARR the charging
00:24:28.279 revenue is about 100 crores ARR today
00:24:30.520 but that's in-house so we have blue
00:24:32.039 smart Mobility which is a hold Co and
00:24:33.799 then we have blue smart charge blue
00:24:35.640 smart Fleet and bl smart Tech are three
00:24:38.559 independent subsidiaries but all
00:24:40.399 reporting to the hold go BL smart charge
00:24:43.159 invest in the real estate and probably
00:24:45.480 leases the land builds all the charging
00:24:47.440 infra operates all the charging infra
00:24:49.760 the Blu smart Fleet uh SPV leases
00:24:52.919 electric cars pays for the drivers and
00:24:55.080 runs all the paraphernalia on the ride
00:24:56.640 healing business Lo SM Tech which owns
00:24:59.240 the IP the the Blu smart app for
00:25:01.640 consumers and they all work together in
00:25:04.440 tandem where the charging company
00:25:07.440 charges for the charging Services which
00:25:09.720 have which are used by the ride dealing
00:25:11.480 Fleet the fleet company's job is to
00:25:13.320 bring in Fleet amounts of Fleet so we
00:25:15.080 have secured financing for 20,000 cars
00:25:16.919 as of now right trying to secure
00:25:18.360 financing for 40,000 cars and are you
00:25:20.360 able to add the scale do it profitably
00:25:23.279 yeah so the charging infra is today
00:25:25.039 profitable because we had the in-house
00:25:26.880 anchor tenant so that was profitable
00:25:29.559 ride healing is a you know Network
00:25:31.520 Effect game so we have to really go deep
00:25:33.480 and wide you really have to scale before
00:25:35.520 you break you what is the rate of growth
00:25:37.440 right now I mean uh it's not massive uh
00:25:40.600 because it takes a lot of time to build
00:25:41.919 up charging in what is it so so so we
00:25:44.200 can probably add 1,000 2,000 cars a
00:25:46.520 month right but we are not able to do
00:25:48.559 that we are only able to add 400 cars to
00:25:50.760 500 cars a month so car financing is
00:25:52.720 secured and adding car is easy peasy
00:25:54.559 right so you write a check you get a car
00:25:56.480 the cars are ready the man ufacture oems
00:25:58.399 in India can supply you G but again I go
00:26:00.720 back to my initial opening statement and
00:26:02.679 say that this is not easy for somebody
00:26:06.760 to do because adding cars is not what we
00:26:09.080 want to do without availability of
00:26:11.120 charging infra the point of this entire
00:26:13.640 thing is we want more young people to
00:26:16.720 start working in the EV industry in one
00:26:20.000 place or another so we want to throw all
00:26:22.240 the information they might require to
00:26:24.080 make up their mind on whether to start a
00:26:26.480 business here or get a job
00:26:29.559 yeah uh who would like to go
00:26:32.919 next suuchi would you really yeah okay
00:26:37.120 so this is how I thought I'd describe
00:26:38.799 myself so um I am a glorified Brewer of
00:26:45.360 green hydrogen and let's not even give a
00:26:47.520 color to it I I'd say I'm a brewer of
00:26:50.480 hydrogen so why I say Brewer is that you
00:26:54.240 know when you're trying to break down
00:26:55.919 technology so that you can pick pitch it
00:26:57.880 to people for funding or you're talking
00:27:00.159 to people to sort of introduce them to a
00:27:02.720 new molecule um you try to dumb the
00:27:05.960 science down but that's not what I want
00:27:08.200 to do
00:27:10.159 uh my skills that I've developed over
00:27:13.120 the last sort of 20 years of you know
00:27:16.360 Engineering in PhD is to be able to um
00:27:20.559 manipulate microorganisms not at the
00:27:23.120 genetic level but to come together as a
00:27:25.720 group and do what I asked them to do and
00:27:28.200 I'm really grateful to them for what
00:27:30.520 they do for me typically when we talk
00:27:32.840 about microorganisms we talk about
00:27:34.600 things like brewing and idly Dosa and
00:27:37.000 food that's that's something that that's
00:27:38.799 tangible we touch that but my
00:27:41.360 microorganisms produce electricity so
00:27:44.000 anytime we have the conversation about
00:27:45.720 solar or wind uh I always tell myself we
00:27:49.000 should have a conversation about
00:27:50.480 microorganisms that generate electricity
00:27:52.559 as well um so that's that's the sort of
00:27:55.600 play still talks about what I do
00:27:58.200 but uh but give us more right um start
00:28:01.200 from the beginning I'm a child of energy
00:28:03.600 my dad is a geologist uh he started as a
00:28:06.679 graduate traine in OMC and he was with
00:28:09.240 them for 40 years and so all I've known
00:28:12.120 all my life is what is Brent price for
00:28:14.919 the day uh did we strike oil at a
00:28:17.720 particular site and the fact that my dad
00:28:19.919 is um really sorry that very active
00:28:22.840 climate denier to him everything is in
00:28:25.440 cycles of centuries not a single Century
00:28:28.640 but multiple centuries so he says we
00:28:31.159 weren't alive and it must have been so
00:28:32.880 hot so many centuries ago uh we don't
00:28:35.600 really know what happens in geology only
00:28:37.640 gives us a clue the way he puts is puts
00:28:40.320 it is that geology is nothing but
00:28:41.919 alcohol and good guest work so to him um
00:28:45.440 us guzzling petrol and his very big
00:28:48.080 contribution in getting all of this oil
00:28:50.320 out um was was not the reason why we
00:28:53.159 were in this situation but I've sort of
00:28:56.039 had a contrarian opinion for exactly
00:28:58.039 that reason so I've done nothing but
00:28:59.760 would you like to just for context like
00:29:02.120 uh would you like to explain climate
00:29:05.039 change in a brief minute absolutely cuz
00:29:07.720 everybody has a different opinion like
00:29:10.480 for a long time I assumed every surface
00:29:13.240 has a albo effect Sun's Rays hit Earth
00:29:17.120 different surfaces reflect different
00:29:19.360 kind of heat back the atmosphere blocks
00:29:22.279 different kind of Ray differently by
00:29:24.720 virtue of what gases are present there
00:29:28.880 but the more people I talk to sometimes
00:29:31.760 somebody's telling me carbon is no
00:29:33.440 longer a problem methane is a problem
00:29:36.159 water vapor is a problem so I want to
00:29:38.360 learn what exactly is climate change
00:29:41.200 today so what does Greenhouse what's a
00:29:44.399 greenhouse right you're trying to create
00:29:45.720 an environment for plants where there's
00:29:47.600 a constant recirculation of CO2 because
00:29:49.600 that's what plants need which means
00:29:51.120 you're creating a dome where everything
00:29:53.080 is more humid everything is more moist
00:29:55.480 and more wet we aren't meant to live in
00:29:58.000 an environment which is supposed to be
00:30:00.200 so highly heated I'll give you a great
00:30:02.679 example and this is something that I
00:30:04.039 find very troubling now has anybody
00:30:06.039 noticed that turbulence has gotten far
00:30:08.559 worse now than say a decade back did you
00:30:11.480 know that's an effect of climate change
00:30:13.559 air is thinner up there than it used to
00:30:15.600 be so aircraft would hit a particular
00:30:18.440 height above which there was no
00:30:20.320 turbulence and now as the air literally
00:30:23.080 heats up even at higher sort of
00:30:25.559 altitudes you feel uh the effect of
00:30:28.279 turbulence I mean a simple way to look
00:30:30.159 at it is if you're thinking of you think
00:30:32.559 of Mercury and Venus what do you think
00:30:34.720 is hotter
00:30:37.000 Mercury no Venus right and uh it's
00:30:41.600 because of the atmosphere right so just
00:30:44.360 because you're closer to heat Source
00:30:46.039 doesn't mean it's hotter the atmosphere
00:30:48.200 plays a much larger role on that front
00:30:51.120 so climate change is the wrong kind of
00:30:53.440 gases in our atmosphere correct making
00:30:55.679 it harder for heat to escape what's
00:30:57.399 happening is by the temperature going up
00:31:00.000 right you're Now Melting the polar ice
00:31:02.360 caps you're therefore at the result of
00:31:05.000 that getting um changing how currents
00:31:07.919 would go so an elnino may come in here
00:31:10.519 your monsoons May shift as a result of
00:31:12.480 it because you putting a lot more um you
00:31:15.039 know changes in ocean currents which
00:31:17.639 then change effect temperature
00:31:20.519 patterns um Arison that would means
00:31:23.880 maius may be under mald may be under
00:31:26.600 water as result of that so it's all
00:31:29.480 starting from the fact that it's it's uh
00:31:32.760 methane it's carbon dioxide is the main
00:31:35.240 ingredients there are others too all of
00:31:37.760 what we are talking about is in a way to
00:31:39.919 curtail climate change can each of you
00:31:42.360 Define climate change in one
00:31:45.080 minute in your own way yeah I mean like
00:31:47.679 I don't know what I understand of
00:31:49.720 climate change is obviously to even
00:31:51.720 Chan's point is um you know heating is
00:31:54.320 obviously causing a lot of challenges if
00:31:56.159 you see the uh the temperature which has
00:31:58.880 you know gone up in the last 10 years is
00:32:01.159 really bad for us I was reading
00:32:02.480 somewhere uh I I think the question is
00:32:04.720 why is the heating yeah it's happening
00:32:06.200 because of emissions right so every year
00:32:09.480 World produces 52 billion tons of you
00:32:12.919 know CO2 emissions Industries more
00:32:15.240 industrialization more cars on the road
00:32:17.639 more manufacturing uh more power plants
00:32:21.000 and because of that emission what is
00:32:22.279 happening two two important contributors
00:32:24.480 are I could say even and blue smart
00:32:26.240 plays a role there to probably curb uh
00:32:28.559 pollution uh transportation and
00:32:32.200 electricity generation these two sectors
00:32:34.919 electricity accounts for 25% to 26% of
00:32:38.720 the world's uh CO2 emissions and and
00:32:42.279 Logistics delivery you know Mobility all
00:32:45.720 put together uh Transportation as a
00:32:47.799 whole uh not just cars uh contribute uh
00:32:51.720 and you can say Airlines also a part of
00:32:53.080 it because Airlines also contribute
00:32:55.080 again another 27% so 52% and this is
00:32:57.360 Bill Gates book which he wrote uh that
00:32:59.639 50% of the global CO2 emission that
00:33:02.519 happen is because of Transportation on
00:33:04.600 ground so if you look at the correlation
00:33:06.200 between the temperature and look at the
00:33:07.840 correlation between the concentr of CO2
00:33:10.440 they have a direct correlation right so
00:33:12.639 that's very critical because the curve
00:33:14.039 is like that right now right and all we
00:33:16.360 can do today is it's going to continue
00:33:19.120 what do we do to reduce that kind of you
00:33:22.440 know the slope of that so if you reduce
00:33:24.919 the slope we may hit this point 100
00:33:27.120 years later if we don't we may be 20
00:33:28.679 years from today so all we can do is
00:33:30.519 probably reduce that slope if we do it
00:33:32.720 today that impact is much bigger we
00:33:34.919 start to do it 10 years from today then
00:33:36.559 that you know you need to have a much
00:33:38.480 more drastic change as we think of it
00:33:40.720 fair tun climate
00:33:42.240 change Sharon's almost a professor he's
00:33:45.880 pretty much finished between him and pun
00:33:47.720 Punit um and I'm probably not the right
00:33:50.519 guy to describe anything more because we
00:33:52.600 didn't actually start ether because of
00:33:55.039 climate and we're not not selling you
00:33:57.679 electric vehicles Prim because it'll
00:33:59.639 save the climate so RV is more energy
00:34:03.000 than climate explain why you selling
00:34:05.279 electric
00:34:06.279 vehicles
00:34:08.639 so what we believed always is that um a
00:34:13.079 lot of this problem fundamentally boils
00:34:14.320 down to using something that's a finite
00:34:16.359 Source the electricity you're using
00:34:18.440 today to run ether is generated from
00:34:20.960 finite sources 75% is finite but 25% is
00:34:23.679 not right has India moved to 25%
00:34:26.399 renewable actually capacity I think is
00:34:28.239 almost 30 much lower no no
00:34:30.399 no% I think either 25 or 27 so so so
00:34:34.560 earlier uh so today renew non-coal I
00:34:37.520 would say so thermal nonthermal actually
00:34:39.480 yeah non-thermal so earlier that number
00:34:41.159 was 95% so renewable percent was less
00:34:43.280 than 1% today total installed capacity
00:34:45.879 is about 175 gaws in India how much is
00:34:48.839 percentage uh I say 26 27% is renewable
00:34:53.719 capacity because the capacity
00:34:55.159 utilization Factor install capacity of
00:34:57.800 thermal is 260 gaw but the cuf the
00:35:00.480 capacity utilization of plf plant load
00:35:02.560 factor is about 70% in solar or wind now
00:35:05.760 again wind is slightly higher on the PS
00:35:07.520 side but the install capacity is 175 but
00:35:10.000 the capacity utilization Factor the
00:35:11.359 plant load Factor who was between 20 to
00:35:13.480 25% solar now depending on new solar
00:35:15.560 power plants could have higher plf wind
00:35:17.280 is above 40 actual utilization of that 1
00:35:20.880 75 gaw could be in the range of about 50
00:35:22.960 gaw North which is the power actually
00:35:25.000 coming out or 60 G actually coming out
00:35:26.520 the capacity depending about 4 to 5% so
00:35:30.040 then you would say in Layman language
00:35:31.599 that it could be 1/4 of the capacity of
00:35:34.480 today so in summary that would mean
00:35:36.760 right now electricity generation 5%
00:35:39.079 renewable 95% no no more like 25 75 so
00:35:43.119 lar language inst capacity basis it's no
00:35:47.200 of the extraction also so I I said 175
00:35:49.520 GW is installed you are getting in terms
00:35:52.119 of plant load Factor capacity PL Factor
00:35:54.200 you are getting 50 gwatt there which 260
00:35:57.760 Odd gaws as for Ministry of M I keep
00:35:59.760 checking data is 270 odd gws but your
00:36:02.839 plf is about 70% what is plf plant load
00:36:05.480 Factor capacity so just because we
00:36:08.680 speaking to like all like you know
00:36:11.160 stupid people like me who don't know
00:36:12.640 much about this industry no
00:36:14.480 abbreviations like no like simple simple
00:36:17.800 words correct so 50 gwatt is how much so
00:36:20.680 sorry to interrupt 50 Gatt is how much
00:36:22.880 of this country is uh 25% 25% renewable
00:36:27.400 is about 1/4 of current today which is
00:36:29.720 an amazing feat uh in the last uh 20
00:36:32.800 years I think is that I did there are
00:36:35.839 variable numbers 5% seems to be a number
00:36:39.800 from some places 25 not se% 5% cross
00:36:44.079 Longo J I think we're using around 15%
00:36:46.800 10 to 15% not more that's my that's what
00:36:49.760 I you know and again the numbers vary
00:36:52.640 katica is pretty high we're probably
00:36:54.920 close to 45 to 45% % in Karnataka
00:36:58.040 because we have a lot of hydro and stuff
00:36:59.319 but that's not true for every state
00:37:01.000 India Energy Mix today uh is about 25%
00:37:04.920 is Renewables that's a published data I
00:37:07.359 me too and um it's okay we all different
00:37:10.040 places 5% 10 to 15% 25% what is the loss
00:37:14.520 of power in Transmission in India 10% 10
00:37:17.720 12% the rest is theft the 25% number
00:37:20.880 that you hear is theft only half of that
00:37:23.560 is actually
00:37:25.599 transmission what we're talking about is
00:37:27.800 power is generated in point x utilized
00:37:30.119 in point Y who does this generally like
00:37:33.480 is it uh Power grade how many companies
00:37:36.000 are there which are doing transmission
00:37:38.240 is there a different number where
00:37:39.880 different kind of losses are happening
00:37:41.319 at different transmission people so
00:37:43.319 they're North Southeast West India now
00:37:44.960 has a one grid One Nation policy that
00:37:46.920 came into effect and the ministry part
00:37:50.079 2003 came with the electricity act where
00:37:52.119 they said that all these different
00:37:53.240 transmission distribution companies
00:37:54.520 which are now there they should be one
00:37:56.000 grid one nation policy power grid came
00:37:57.920 in and said said that somebody's
00:37:59.720 producing power north east west south
00:38:01.880 it's one Central grid of India everybody
00:38:03.599 reports you can go on this website
00:38:04.880 called vidut pr. where you can see on
00:38:07.200 realtime basis where the power is being
00:38:09.200 generated what is the source of that
00:38:10.599 energy MH in fact that's the right
00:38:12.800 website to go and check out what's
00:38:14.400 India's Energy Mix it's called vidut pr.
00:38:16.920 by Ministry of power on average in the
00:38:18.640 country would you say 10 to 25% 10 to
00:38:20.920 12% okay and that's come down post this
00:38:23.400 one grid One Nation policy was earlier
00:38:25.599 nobody was answerable then then the
00:38:27.280 question to
00:38:28.680 tarun if let's assume midway between all
00:38:33.119 of you guys let's say 15 to 20% of power
00:38:35.760 is
00:38:36.599 renewable if you're going to lose 10 to
00:38:39.319 20% of that in emission let's say we
00:38:42.280 left with 15 16% in India is renewable
00:38:45.800 85% is fossil
00:38:48.160 based does it still make sense to pay
00:38:52.280 the premium to buy an electric vehicle
00:38:54.800 because your netet in in today's State
00:38:57.960 putting the same amount of emissions out
00:38:59.960 there even if it was 100% coal based it
00:39:03.800 will still make sense because so the
00:39:05.960 thing is You' be around 30% better in
00:39:08.640 India's current grid 30 to 35% from an
00:39:12.400 ice engine vehicle huh so an internal
00:39:14.960 combustion engine vehicle is an
00:39:16.599 efficiency of around 25% MH an electric
00:39:19.440 machine is around 90% probably in drive
00:39:22.040 cycles around 85 so you're talking of
00:39:24.200 around three times efficient per unit of
00:39:27.240 energy per unit of energy so now if I
00:39:29.000 take the fuel and burn it then I'm using
00:39:31.079 three times more energy at unit the
00:39:33.160 comparison this is with the power power
00:39:35.240 plant right yeah so the Gap there is the
00:39:37.000 power plant is far more efficient the
00:39:38.440 power plants are far more efficient than
00:39:40.520 ice ice engine vehle scoter and car
00:39:42.720 engines they would be actually lucky to
00:39:44.599 hit 25% that's at the good efficiency
00:39:46.440 Factor they're usually hovering in the
00:39:48.160 20 W number but the power plants operate
00:39:51.160 at like 35% like pretty good efficiency
00:39:54.720 factors mats work
00:39:57.000 MH you can sure the 35 10% efficiency
00:39:59.760 will become 32 it's still way better so
00:40:01.960 you're saying even if the power is
00:40:04.160 generated in in one way or better
00:40:06.359 running electric at the end point
00:40:08.599 electric vehicles are a lot more
00:40:10.040 efficient at using that energy well yeah
00:40:11.839 and there's also multiple things right I
00:40:13.319 think there is an issue around climate
00:40:14.960 change but there's also an issue on
00:40:17.079 local emissions right and today in
00:40:19.040 cities if you think of nox and what's
00:40:20.839 happening in Delhi even with CG and
00:40:22.440 stuff you know you you have zero
00:40:24.359 emissions at local level it's also
00:40:27.400 easier to control emissions at single
00:40:29.960 point right at a power plant it's hard
00:40:32.480 to control that over a million Vehicles
00:40:34.560 right and that deteriorates so now let's
00:40:37.040 look at today and 10 years from today
00:40:38.560 the ice vehicle that's giving you X
00:40:40.200 today will probably be emitting 2x 10
00:40:42.480 years from today right the electric
00:40:44.560 vehicle today which is 30% less right
00:40:47.400 but probably 70% Less in the future
00:40:49.400 because in the next 10 years the grid
00:40:50.720 will become cleaner so in a way then you
00:40:52.800 start to look at the differential it
00:40:54.839 becomes far bigger no right so that's an
00:40:57.359 important thing to once you
00:41:00.880 B for me the only concern is that
00:41:04.440 imagine a scenario and it's it's a best
00:41:06.720 case scenario for the both of you
00:41:08.560 specifically maybe specifically for you
00:41:10.920 imagine if all vehicles suddenly boom
00:41:14.319 overnight become EES aren't you just
00:41:17.280 taking we have enough electricity we
00:41:18.880 have enough energy it's not about how
00:41:20.560 much electricity you have I'm glad you
00:41:22.599 think we have not I just said like it is
00:41:24.960 it is in scooters at least our math was
00:41:27.160 it is 40% it is 40% uh less emission
00:41:32.160 than a petrol scooter so what all that
00:41:34.440 you're at least reducing emissions by
00:41:35.640 40% even if the grid does not become
00:41:38.880 Greener at all like become green
00:41:42.040 green at all even if the grid becomes
00:41:43.760 worse 100% coal uh even in that case you
00:41:48.359 would still be at least as he said 30%
00:41:50.079 more efficient more less than % when it
00:41:52.640 comes to no and that's a super bad
00:41:54.520 scenario it's like the world is going
00:41:55.760 back we
00:41:56.839 startus 1.5° this it is the world is
00:42:00.640 going back on generation the world is I
00:42:02.960 heard the Senate hearing of Elon Musk in
00:42:05.160 the US where the senator who was
00:42:07.720 questioning him said if everybody were
00:42:10.000 to buy a Tesla
00:42:11.359 today you would need
00:42:14.280 20x the energy 20x the electricity
00:42:17.560 America is producing today so are you
00:42:19.480 thinking the way to do this is
00:42:21.160 transition slowly the senator mat seems
00:42:23.240 wrong 4X or 20x I can't let's look at
00:42:25.599 India right India has around a park size
00:42:28.200 of around 250 million Vehicles scooters
00:42:31.119 cars buses trucks everything put
00:42:32.839 together let's look bit more 300 300
00:42:36.000 close to 300 now right so let's look
00:42:37.839 fast forward to 2030 say 450 million
00:42:41.040 let's say if we have some connected
00:42:42.800 vehicles and more you know uh maybe you
00:42:45.680 have 400 or you know 350 to 400 now if
00:42:49.119 everything is electric the park size
00:42:51.280 right which is highly unlikely you need
00:42:53.520 around 300 gaw of renewable energy
00:42:56.880 India is targeting 575 by 2030 yes right
00:43:00.559 so now to put that in context that's
00:43:03.880 0.5% less than 05% of the land size of
00:43:07.280 of uh Rajasthan M okay with solar panels
00:43:11.240 we're estimating you know two wheelers
00:43:14.520 maybe 50 to 70% by 2030 cars maybe 30%
00:43:19.119 three-wheelers maybe 100% by 2030 buses
00:43:21.559 and stuff maybe that's only new vehicles
00:43:24.440 but that new vehicles is say you know 25
00:43:27.839 million a year and then you're saying
00:43:29.640 maybe 50% of that is electric right it's
00:43:32.160 10 million but then if the park is
00:43:33.880 already 300 you're adding 10 million
00:43:36.000 more right so in the next 5 years you
00:43:38.160 adding 50 million right so 50 million of
00:43:40.880 that is still 25% or less than that 20%
00:43:44.119 of the park size right I've given you
00:43:46.640 I've given you the example of everything
00:43:48.280 going electric but if you then just look
00:43:50.079 at that piece of it you may need
00:43:52.440 significant less amount of energy
00:43:55.079 right last year India added probably the
00:43:58.720 amount of energy for air conditioners
00:44:01.680 that we've just added in India could
00:44:03.720 power over 5 million Vehicles so to put
00:44:06.960 that in perspective we forget that what
00:44:08.880 our LED TVs are doing and what air
00:44:11.079 conditioning is doing right and amount
00:44:13.079 energy we're using for that compared to
00:44:16.319 guys we put a million vehicles on our
00:44:17.880 roads but a lot of them was two wheelers
00:44:19.839 right this is with cars and everything
00:44:21.800 but and all of these are essentially
00:44:23.800 burning coal if not in your vehicle
00:44:27.359 the come the thing is you're talking
00:44:30.400 about once you buy the electric vehicle
00:44:32.640 right today it's 30% better next year
00:44:35.359 the energy grid gets better it's 35
00:44:37.559 following year is 40 then it's 50 then
00:44:39.480 it's what happens to the increase in
00:44:41.400 temperature though so you you you're
00:44:43.079 saying the tradeoff is still no no
00:44:45.440 you're saying in favor so all you're
00:44:47.680 we're trying to still control the 1.5
00:44:49.480 degre somewhere here right or we I think
00:44:51.640 I think the point they're trying to make
00:44:53.000 is if the
00:44:54.960 renewable mix in energy generation is
00:44:58.599 going up at the pace that it
00:45:00.480 is electric vehicles will make more
00:45:03.119 sense even in the future right yes and
00:45:06.240 also what you have to see is that that
00:45:08.079 certain policy certain sorry but that's
00:45:10.680 changing but until then we I'm think
00:45:13.920 something let's put I mean let's look at
00:45:17.040 today policies are changing right it was
00:45:19.040 it was right now at 100 G kilowatt you
00:45:21.440 can now get a connection Open Access
00:45:24.240 Open Access which is earlier a mega in
00:45:26.280 some cities some states is 500 kilow
00:45:29.079 right um we're talking to them to
00:45:32.200 cumulate demand which is not happening
00:45:34.200 but if the government Now talks of
00:45:35.559 cumulating Demand on energy
00:45:37.040 infrastructure I could ask nickel hey
00:45:39.400 guys here's a 10year purchase agreement
00:45:42.119 right put up a solar plant outside
00:45:44.720 Bangalore I don't need it here right
00:45:46.599 I'll buy energy for you 10 years you can
00:45:48.800 make your 17 15% return 177% return on
00:45:51.800 your money and I will get energy 20%
00:45:54.200 cheaper than the grid and and it'll be
00:45:56.280 green my customers environment is good
00:45:59.559 and everyone makes business you could
00:46:01.599 not say this 5 seven years ago right
00:46:04.040 today you can say that I can actually
00:46:05.800 make business sense to put renewable
00:46:08.480 energy in place some policy Frameworks
00:46:11.079 have to be cleaned up if that policy
00:46:13.040 framework is cleaned up in Delhi we need
00:46:15.839 10 megawatts I get it overnight you need
00:46:19.319 probably 50 megawatts or 40 megawatts
00:46:21.240 we' get it overnight which means all of
00:46:23.160 us in the business will do that if he
00:46:26.079 has an ather Network on his charging
00:46:27.760 infrastructure and he can accumulate the
00:46:29.440 demand he says I'm going to buy this
00:46:30.880 much from you because I'm using this
00:46:32.520 demand so in the next couple of years
00:46:34.760 what has to happen is energy and
00:46:36.160 Mobility have come together and these
00:46:37.559 departments have been separate right and
00:46:40.200 once they come together and they look at
00:46:41.839 a bigger picture of 80 billion of
00:46:45.119 imports 100 billion of imports of oil I
00:46:47.720 mean what we talked is one is climate
00:46:49.440 the second is really the energy equation
00:46:51.079 for the country what's driving policy is
00:46:52.760 energy equation of and climate but
00:46:54.960 energy equation is much figger if what
00:46:56.960 we've talked about by 2030 that all
00:46:58.760 surface Transportation could be
00:47:00.680 electric that's 100 billion to 150
00:47:04.040 billion of less import right what does
00:47:06.359 that do to the economy that's insane so
00:47:08.400 I think we have to look at it from both
00:47:09.559 sides doubl it $50 billion in 2018 when
00:47:12.640 we writing the white paper for blue
00:47:13.960 smart uh now that number is $120 billion
00:47:16.839 in fact in the last budget said that
00:47:19.079 first time it it was 100 billion last
00:47:20.760 year it's projected this 120 so in five
00:47:23.160 years 2x SOI why don't you finish your
00:47:25.160 introduction
00:47:26.240 sure can we can we start this
00:47:27.920 conversation off with what is green
00:47:29.599 hydrogen and the fuel source everybody
00:47:31.520 green hydrogen is is creating hydrogen
00:47:34.280 from a renewable source renable source
00:47:36.440 right gray hydrogen would be I take
00:47:38.359 methane and I split it so I'm I'm still
00:47:40.760 putting emissions out and I get hydrogen
00:47:42.720 or ammonia other depending how you think
00:47:45.440 about the structure so green is from
00:47:47.160 renewable I take wind energy I take
00:47:48.760 solar I take any renewable energy and
00:47:50.800 create green electron so that's green
00:47:52.119 hydrogen and sui you take Industrial
00:47:53.880 Waste and make hyd absolutely so so for
00:47:56.400 us the problem here is exactly what come
00:47:59.040 come from the back of your story so
00:48:00.440 people have context as to how you
00:48:02.119 started making hydrogen sure sure so
00:48:04.680 going back to the original story i' I've
00:48:07.119 always been in and around energy
00:48:10.359 definitely thought bioenergy is
00:48:12.440 critically important maybe because I
00:48:14.119 have a degree in the field uh talk about
00:48:16.400 your education right um I this table is
00:48:20.680 so intimidating right now I I come from
00:48:23.200 very humble engineering background I
00:48:25.760 glad I have an education it is insane to
00:48:28.520 me that I have a PhD degree but I think
00:48:30.520 that just it was it is just just
00:48:33.000 something that happened what is your PhD
00:48:34.520 in it it's a degree known as bioprocess
00:48:37.040 technology I'm from I got my PhD from
00:48:40.440 Institute of chemical technology which
00:48:42.400 is used to be known as udct University
00:48:45.480 Department of chemical technology it's a
00:48:47.800 pre-independence Institute that was
00:48:49.640 created for the textile industry in
00:48:51.359 Bombay still sits out of matunga um
00:48:54.680 unfortunately because of the textile
00:48:56.280 industry collapse in the' 60s and the'
00:48:58.000 70s they had to look for other things to
00:49:00.000 do but they stuck to only one thing a
00:49:03.000 stupid person like me how would you
00:49:04.520 explain what your PhD is in one line
00:49:07.599 very simple um I just engineered a few
00:49:10.599 microorganisms to break down
00:49:12.520 agricultural waste basically crop
00:49:14.760 residue which continues to remain a
00:49:16.960 problem 5 years after I finished my PhD
00:49:20.240 and converted to ethanol so ethanol as a
00:49:22.880 fuel additive um he was at the Center of
00:49:25.920 energy biosciences and and uh the key
00:49:28.960 skills I developed was once again how do
00:49:30.960 you create a community of microorganisms
00:49:33.359 to do what you want them to do but the
00:49:35.760 problem we were solving was how do you
00:49:37.520 prevent crop Burning uh instead of
00:49:39.680 coming up with ways of disposing of the
00:49:41.640 crop in more meaningful ways suppose you
00:49:43.760 could convert it to something more
00:49:45.559 useful which in our case we thought was
00:49:47.760 ethanol the government was making a
00:49:49.599 heavy push for something known as second
00:49:51.839 generation cellulosic ethanol which is
00:49:54.400 basically to use non food sources as a
00:49:56.960 feed stock for making ethanol as a fuel
00:49:59.040 additive how did you go from your PhD in
00:50:01.240 this to starting to create hydrogen and
00:50:03.200 ois your company oh my god um I had
00:50:06.720 finished my PhD and um I was working for
00:50:10.680 my professor my advisor engineering
00:50:13.440 company was an engineering procurement
00:50:15.200 and construction company that's what
00:50:16.799 chemical Engineers do Technologies out
00:50:19.000 of our lab needed to be pitched to and
00:50:21.040 we were heavily working with the psus so
00:50:23.359 you need to go out and talk about what
00:50:24.920 value the technology can bring and that
00:50:26.640 was me in the business development role
00:50:29.119 um in between all of this I had my
00:50:32.119 professor's friend who is very wealthy
00:50:34.359 but not formally educated he has a sort
00:50:36.880 of sugar uh Mill which runs one half of
00:50:39.960 the Year producing ethanol in the other
00:50:41.720 half making sugar and one day his plant
00:50:44.440 was shut down and he didn't quite
00:50:46.400 understand because for some bizarre
00:50:47.520 reason the notification was in English
00:50:49.520 not in marati as you would expect coming
00:50:51.760 from Maharashtra and he came came to my
00:50:53.760 professor and he said uh what is going
00:50:56.160 on and he said you've been illegally
00:50:57.960 dumping your Wastewater effluent as it's
00:51:00.799 called and he said I have no idea I I
00:51:03.400 give a dude money to sort of take it
00:51:05.520 away from my side this man who's been
00:51:07.680 collecting money from my professor's
00:51:10.040 sort of friend has been going around the
00:51:12.000 block and dumping it right there because
00:51:14.079 hey somebody paid me to take care of it
00:51:16.000 I took care of it um that's when my
00:51:18.520 professor gave me a sort of brief to say
00:51:20.839 what do you think are the pathways as
00:51:22.599 it's called in sort of biochemistry or
00:51:24.559 biology that we can use to treat this
00:51:27.160 sugar industry waste water that's when I
00:51:29.400 happened to find this very neat biology
00:51:31.760 which was not typical these were
00:51:33.839 microorganisms which are minor in
00:51:36.000 community they occur in our gut our
00:51:38.440 brain and soil and they produce uh
00:51:40.839 electrons or electricity and they're
00:51:42.760 constantly stressed and I really related
00:51:44.640 to them for that reason uh these
00:51:47.200 microorganisms yes um you it's a
00:51:50.400 stressful I would not recommend a PhD to
00:51:52.599 anyone I would in fact say don't get an
00:51:54.920 education
00:51:55.920 I I'll give you some context okay so in
00:51:57.760 sui's company we an investor and every
00:52:00.880 time I've been on a zoom call with her
00:52:02.680 and heard something it takes me a lot of
00:52:04.480 time to go back and research and figure
00:52:06.760 out what she said in the first place oh
00:52:08.440 no I'm so
00:52:09.599 sorry I apologize for that so basically
00:52:13.119 what happened was I I needed funding to
00:52:14.880 test this out and I said hey professor
00:52:16.480 give me some money and he said no sorry
00:52:19.240 um I think you I think you should you
00:52:20.839 should stick to this you you give good
00:52:22.480 presentations and honestly I I thought
00:52:24.720 I'd be a good academic this was a break
00:52:27.280 before I start off my postdoc in the US
00:52:29.920 and I'm someone who's used to working
00:52:32.400 with what's known as a m spectrometer
00:52:34.480 it's this big device that breaks down
00:52:36.359 proteins and tells you what what's there
00:52:38.520 and I was really keen on
00:52:40.640 that and then I said wait what if I I
00:52:43.520 like get funding to test out this
00:52:45.319 technology and uh fortunately for me
00:52:47.720 shell had a program known as the shell
00:52:49.480 E4 program I have zero idea about
00:52:52.079 entrepreneurship at this point I'm
00:52:53.839 pretty sure I misspelled it all the time
00:52:55.280 time as well and once I joined the
00:52:57.839 program they gave me some money to test
00:52:59.520 it out the only credit I'd give myself
00:53:02.359 was that I had a very specific problem I
00:53:04.160 had identified for them um fracking back
00:53:06.839 in 2017 18 was producing more water than
00:53:09.799 oil and here I had the opportunity to
00:53:12.280 produce green hydrogen using these
00:53:14.880 microorganisms and simultaneously
00:53:17.079 recycle water it was a win-win but this
00:53:19.559 was not to technology meant for India
00:53:21.640 was ready to go off to the US uh as as I
00:53:25.599 had planned and
00:53:27.799 20 when did Co happen about 4 days
00:53:30.440 before lockdown in Bangalore I had my
00:53:32.119 tickets booked in and I had to sort of
00:53:34.480 shut shop and say can't do anything but
00:53:36.960 one thing led to another we got data
00:53:39.160 steel as a customer and um it's it's
00:53:42.559 there's no that's not been much of a
00:53:44.799 turnaround after that good thing we did
00:53:47.200 was select green hydrogen as a molecule
00:53:49.280 there was no policy I'm pretty certain
00:53:51.760 people when we had when we had demo day
00:53:54.319 pictures people would ask ask us what do
00:53:55.640 you use the hydrogen for um so it's it's
00:53:58.599 it's been a long journey to this point I
00:54:01.799 still want you to explain in a very
00:54:03.799 Layman way what exactly you do we're
00:54:06.079 producing electrons which is used for
00:54:07.920 hydrogen gas the water is intact and is
00:54:11.119 recycled for reuse on site okay so
00:54:13.119 there's dirty water comes to you yes you
00:54:16.280 create electrons yes where is hydrogen
00:54:18.520 coming from think of it as this vessel
00:54:20.319 right uh there's waste water in it not
00:54:23.319 demineralized or Des inated water gandha
00:54:26.280 P sitting in that you have a couple of
00:54:28.680 electrodes placed inside on one
00:54:31.240 electrode you have microorganisms so
00:54:33.400 they're trapped onto the electrode
00:54:34.920 surface and they're doing their business
00:54:37.040 of producing electrons there's a there's
00:54:40.200 a difference in potential between the
00:54:42.000 two electrodes that's why the electrons
00:54:45.200 which are produced by the microorganisms
00:54:47.079 are carried from the anode to the
00:54:49.319 cathode which is the opposing electrode
00:54:51.839 two electrons two protons which are
00:54:54.280 coming from water combined to make
00:54:56.040 hydrogen gas so hydrogen gas is the
00:54:58.880 product that you get out of the reactor
00:55:01.160 electron is an intermediate but the
00:55:03.400 source of the electron is biological in
00:55:05.880 nature and not electrochemical so it's
00:55:08.240 not coming from solar it's not coming
00:55:09.960 from wind uh the added Advantage is that
00:55:13.400 here's some clean water for you to reuse
00:55:16.160 we request you to please reuse it it's
00:55:18.680 free of cost what is OES doing now how
00:55:21.160 much have you scaled to uh who is this
00:55:25.680 feasible for today to use OES so anybody
00:55:29.720 who has um waste water at their site and
00:55:33.359 also requires green hydrogen is
00:55:36.240 obviously our beach Head Market because
00:55:38.000 then we don't you're doing away with the
00:55:39.960 distance problem which is which is
00:55:42.160 honestly what people talk about when it
00:55:43.799 comes to Green hydrogen uh you would
00:55:46.960 much rather produce green hydrogen as a
00:55:49.039 storage molecule during renewable energy
00:55:52.000 production which is a whole other canop
00:55:54.559 formis of about to open now so anytime
00:55:56.880 there's surge so you have all of this
00:55:59.520 power that you can't put on the grid
00:56:01.559 whether it's wind or solar um you can
00:56:04.400 use pumped hydro and there's other sort
00:56:06.440 of strategies for storing that Excess
00:56:09.039 power otherwise you're having to scale
00:56:10.720 back or Worse completely stop production
00:56:14.000 if you use that excess energy to split
00:56:16.799 water voila you have hydrogen gas it has
00:56:20.160 industrial use etc etc but it's
00:56:22.400 basically used to store energy that you
00:56:24.599 could
00:56:25.440 otherwise put onto the grid the problem
00:56:28.000 with all of this that no one will talk
00:56:29.440 to you about is that for producing 1
00:56:32.000 kilogram of hydrogen using by splitting
00:56:35.760 water you would need depending on who
00:56:38.880 you speak to 9 kg of water which is 9 L
00:56:43.359 going all the way up to 30 L of water if
00:56:45.799 it requires treatment treatment is
00:56:48.160 basically making it desalinated water in
00:56:50.680 a country where 500 million people don't
00:56:53.760 have access to drinking water India's
00:56:56.319 Target of 5 billion tons of indigenous
00:56:59.799 green hydrogen production would require
00:57:02.400 approximately 50 million tons of
00:57:05.280 water that on this table nobody supports
00:57:08.280 hydrogen then except if you use osis
00:57:11.400 technology in which case you get water
00:57:13.039 back again so there is a this is a Nazi
00:57:15.720 era technology is like growing really
00:57:17.640 fast I'm saying so who are they're using
00:57:19.760 it so what does it cost for a kg of
00:57:21.880 hydrogen I can give you the good number
00:57:23.960 I can give you the bad number so
00:57:25.160 everybody wants to hear it's it's
00:57:26.480 officially known as shot shot so it's
00:57:29.839 it's hydrogen priced at under a dollar
00:57:32.280 it's an Indo us joint program um so it's
00:57:36.799 about
00:57:37.760 88 US 1 kilog of hydrogen 1 kilogram of
00:57:40.960 hydrogen H and and that generates how
00:57:42.880 much um 33 kilow hour it's the highest
00:57:46.280 in energy density compared to we got two
00:57:48.400 rupes per
00:57:50.559 kilowatt converting this is really cheap
00:57:53.359 I mean I'm just conion 30% efficien this
00:57:55.960 is massively horrible efficiency for
00:57:58.359 converting it back into is heat energy
00:58:01.000 so 67 R but why would you converted back
00:58:03.200 into electricity you would just use the
00:58:04.599 hydrogen
00:58:07.079 because Mobility but you're talking a
00:58:09.839 dollar I mean that for certain psus uh
00:58:13.559 in refining it's 40 rupees per kilogram
00:58:17.640 um it's a very interesting chemistry you
00:58:20.200 so you basically have before electrons
00:58:22.359 are generated you need to break all the
00:58:24.760 organic content down to what are known
00:58:26.599 as shot chain fatty acids those of us
00:58:29.000 interested in gut health I've heard a
00:58:31.119 lot about sh chain fatty acids because
00:58:32.960 it talks about how well you your stomach
00:58:35.000 is doing at digesting but it's the very
00:58:37.359 same short chain fatty acids that you
00:58:39.160 need as
00:58:40.119 precursor refineries produce a lot of uh
00:58:43.559 acids and alcohols in their waste water
00:58:45.680 which means you're you're starting with
00:58:48.000 exactly what you need so that's the
00:58:49.400 cheapest having said that if you add
00:58:52.839 compression because you need to use the
00:58:55.039 hydrogen thank you so much it basically
00:58:58.599 bumps all the way up to 112 rupees per
00:59:01.680 kilogram compared to market price of
00:59:03.839 course it's 1/4 if you bought from
00:59:07.160 certain large multinational corporations
00:59:10.680 using long off take agreements would
00:59:13.440 cost you about 400 bucks per kilogram so
00:59:16.640 this is still cheaper than oh that's
00:59:18.599 damage what is osis use case for us um
00:59:23.720 it it's complet different from the whole
00:59:25.720 Mobility angle um tell us your angle
00:59:28.880 it's industrial use right um for us
00:59:32.319 we're not even talking about uh steel
00:59:34.760 for example steel is very specific we
00:59:37.240 got lucky uh we had a team that worked
00:59:40.480 with us that was great so we could
00:59:42.280 accelerate very quickly we're looking to
00:59:44.480 produce about 21 tons of green hydrogen
00:59:47.119 per day at a certain
00:59:49.359 site however going beyond that the
00:59:53.079 capacity for consumption currently
00:59:55.240 doesn't exist even government policy
00:59:57.880 asks us to wait until 2030 then they'll
01:00:00.920 have the export system set up and then
01:00:03.760 they'll uh Force certain industry like
01:00:06.599 uh chemicals ethylene cement and uh
01:00:09.680 steel to sort of decarbonize using
01:00:11.599 hydrogen as a molecule but we can't
01:00:13.240 really afford to wait right so who are
01:00:14.920 you selling to today so those who use it
01:00:16.760 as a raw uh raw material uh chemical
01:00:19.520 industry uses hydrogen quite frequently
01:00:22.400 in processes such as hydrogenation so
01:00:25.119 it's not energy it's not heat it's
01:00:27.480 basically a a building block molecule to
01:00:31.200 upgrade certain chemicals that's what
01:00:33.119 laners right that's why like they
01:00:35.280 interest in hydrogen they just need a
01:00:37.000 lot of hydrogen they need a lot of
01:00:38.799 hydrogen because they refined so
01:00:40.119 refineries are obviously but the
01:00:42.599 government would have it's not always
01:00:43.680 energy sometimes it's a good raw
01:00:45.160 material absolutely so how much are you
01:00:47.400 selling now in terms of sales as a
01:00:49.640 company it's not much it's it's our
01:00:51.760 largest plant it's with another starch
01:00:54.240 so orbital manufacturer in Amad um our
01:00:57.160 maximum capacity currently is 250 kg per
01:01:01.280 day and we use only 18 cubic M or 18,000
01:01:06.079 L of uh this particular affluent to do
01:01:09.359 it that's our largest sort of plant so
01:01:12.280 far we have an off-take agreement that
01:01:14.680 we're really scared of for about one ton
01:01:17.920 per day uh for another certain client in
01:01:21.200 the steel industry but the idea is that
01:01:23.960 the active working operation is 250 kg
01:01:27.240 it's a drop in the ocean for you to hit
01:01:30.160 5 million tons per year you need about
01:01:32.920 10,000 tons per day um fortunately for
01:01:36.359 us we we know that we need only about 35
01:01:39.160 sites where there is enough density of
01:01:42.280 organic matter in the waste water but
01:01:44.920 once again we can't really wait until
01:01:47.039 2030 so a few months down the line we
01:01:49.839 will have to start uh dumping the
01:01:51.720 hydrogen on the open markets basically
01:01:54.480 spot trading exactly the way LNG is
01:01:57.480 traded and you use the same sort of LNG
01:02:00.319 route go from Australia Japan South
01:02:02.960 Korea and on onwards because there's a
01:02:05.720 detailed pipeline for hydrogen that
01:02:07.680 exists but that's gray hydrogen the idea
01:02:10.480 here is to sort of uh bust the market by
01:02:13.880 selling it at such low values so suuchi
01:02:16.200 if I were to ask you the question not
01:02:18.799 for two- wheelers or cars but for trucks
01:02:22.480 or buses is green hydrogen tomorrow
01:02:26.160 going to be a viable source of energy
01:02:29.119 compared to ev's Electric all of that we
01:02:32.160 not sources of energy we are the
01:02:35.480 consumers so if they could generate
01:02:37.640 hydrogen electricity a of it we use it
01:02:40.000 so that we don't see as as a genuine
01:02:42.599 option very inefficient we won't but
01:02:44.960 converting it back into electrons is not
01:02:46.920 really I'm talking about a bus which
01:02:48.599 runs on hydrogen yes so fuel cell
01:02:50.880 Vehicles given versus a bus which runs
01:02:53.559 on electricity
01:02:55.000 in terms of no please no correctly in
01:02:57.920 terms of tailpipe emissions I think it's
01:03:00.799 as good as batteries um I think the
01:03:04.160 whole equation here is that the longer
01:03:07.640 uh the distance trucks have to go or
01:03:10.680 Transportation has to go the economics
01:03:13.079 of hydrogen start to work out better
01:03:15.359 because here the whole transmission
01:03:16.799 storage Etc so you still have that ratio
01:03:19.000 we talked about right so if you're
01:03:20.559 taking the same electron from the
01:03:22.200 renewable energy you're using three
01:03:24.000 times more so whatever the cost of
01:03:26.480 electricity tomorrow is one rup it's
01:03:28.839 going to cost the cost for a hydrogen
01:03:30.799 fuel cell vehicle will be three times
01:03:33.200 more than a a battery operated electric
01:03:37.000 vehicle whatever it works out on that
01:03:39.039 front but you might get a longer range
01:03:41.039 right so you yes you make it longer
01:03:42.960 range and now um with batteries with
01:03:46.480 battery swapping you address that range
01:03:48.119 piece of it in a much better way um so
01:03:51.079 where I think there could be an
01:03:52.599 opportunity is in in in some locomotive
01:03:56.480 applications where you've electrified a
01:03:58.400 certain piece and you haven't done a
01:03:59.920 large piece maybe it could be a
01:04:01.400 transitional area that would make sense
01:04:03.079 because long
01:04:04.240 distance um markets like us where you
01:04:07.599 would actually do you know thousand
01:04:09.920 miles a day and you you you and you want
01:04:12.079 to run it and you run two ships on it
01:04:13.960 right uh with autonomous trucks coming
01:04:15.880 in you want to run maybe 18 hours a day
01:04:18.079 right there you're refueling maybe your
01:04:20.240 thing so it could it could play a role
01:04:22.920 right but markets like India where
01:04:25.000 you're probably doing 500 km a day MH or
01:04:27.599 600 you're probably stopping every 3
01:04:30.680 hours for a break from a driver fatigue
01:04:33.119 point of view or four hours that could
01:04:35.200 fit within swapping fast charging others
01:04:38.279 so it won't make sense and India is a
01:04:40.960 very most markets globally are very
01:04:43.000 economically the commercial Market is
01:04:45.160 very economically oriented right every
01:04:46.920 Market is right so so it unless it makes
01:04:49.279 economic sense it doesn't it could make
01:04:53.039 sense to replace diesel mhm but
01:04:55.640 electrics pure electrics could still be
01:04:57.440 cheaper so it would still be a say if
01:04:59.839 Diesel's costing you xess could be maybe
01:05:01.640 10% less and the other one could be 40 I
01:05:03.760 mean 40% less so in that from that point
01:05:05.799 of view it could still be an area of
01:05:08.279 zero emission and makes sense I think
01:05:10.880 hydrogen was sort of born as a concept
01:05:13.720 for vehicles in a time when Vehicles
01:05:16.720 just could do large range like
01:05:20.240 B so yeah if you can't do 500 km in a
01:05:23.480 truck what your option like hydrogen is
01:05:26.119 your only option you have a different
01:05:28.039 proposition with green so that that's
01:05:30.599 genuine no emissions so the reason why
01:05:33.880 the first ntpc buses started in L is a
01:05:37.760 rarified air and low temperature so
01:05:40.359 these are places where batter is
01:05:41.680 struggled but very these will remain
01:05:43.799 Niche segments Niche use cases but as he
01:05:47.319 said in India now with batteries doing
01:05:49.279 the range that they can and fast
01:05:51.279 charging and swapping it's it's becoming
01:05:53.799 a very limited use case where hydrogen
01:05:56.760 is your only option and if hydrogen is
01:05:58.680 not your only option then it's the most
01:06:00.599 expensive option I think quite
01:06:03.079 paradoxically for some reason it's
01:06:05.799 hydrogen that's first looked at if
01:06:07.799 you're talking about buses everybody's
01:06:10.640 looking Tata Motors I'm because coming
01:06:13.000 from that same Legacy like it's it's the
01:06:15.240 same set of bureaucrat same set of
01:06:17.119 Consultants still riding the reports who
01:06:19.039 are still basically saying well
01:06:20.799 batteries are $400 a kilow hour you know
01:06:23.000 they can't do more than 300 of range
01:06:25.359 it's it's it's coming from that era so
01:06:27.240 if you look behind sort of market for
01:06:31.279 um clean buses you would definitely see
01:06:35.119 more tenders whatever be the mindset um
01:06:38.480 for FCS over batteries when it comes to
01:06:42.480 buses and and I'm not even sure about
01:06:44.319 distance here how big is Le and another
01:06:47.760 question young
01:06:50.079 entrepreneur 20y old going to college is
01:06:53.400 there an opport opportunity to work in
01:06:55.119 your industry and if so what Punit gave
01:06:57.640 us two things he said you can set up a
01:07:00.839 solar plant earn between 15 to 18 19%
01:07:04.599 interest or you can raise funding lease
01:07:07.319 Vehicles set up something like blue
01:07:09.119 Smart in your industry what is the
01:07:11.680 opportunity for an entrepreneur I think
01:07:13.640 it it ours is more of uh an opportunity
01:07:17.400 with roots
01:07:18.640 in climate change as a problem um we're
01:07:23.279 looking
01:07:24.559 for kids who are driven by the need to
01:07:28.039 change the way things are or to build a
01:07:29.760 future for themselves so they are
01:07:32.359 willing to address very large problems
01:07:36.279 which aren't um so you could work for IT
01:07:40.079 services company and I'm sure you're
01:07:41.960 solving a problem which is like large on
01:07:44.799 scale but this is an existential crisis
01:07:47.960 so all of that engineering skill set
01:07:50.319 which would otherwise have gone into
01:07:52.160 mnc's need to come into climate change
01:07:55.400 and green jobs so I would not
01:07:58.599 say it's still a nent industry it isn't
01:08:02.520 even really an industry it's pretty much
01:08:04.200 a cottage industry I remember when it
01:08:06.319 was just us and another company for a
01:08:09.000 long time now you you have Mom and Pop
01:08:11.240 establishments all talking about
01:08:12.960 electrolyzers so from a business point
01:08:15.160 of view sure if you could export import
01:08:18.439 electrolyzers into the country you have
01:08:20.880 all you have two Ministries so there's
01:08:23.880 Ministry of new and renewable energy and
01:08:26.279 Ministry of power each with sort of
01:08:28.479 different parts of the hydrogen equation
01:08:30.799 that they're dealing with so MRE
01:08:33.920 typically deals with what happens how do
01:08:36.319 you push consumption what's known as
01:08:38.600 site so it's just green hydrogen
01:08:40.839 consumption which it's trying to push
01:08:43.000 for and Ministry of power basically says
01:08:45.439 I will take
01:08:47.399 anything electrolyzers and more um as a
01:08:51.198 source for green hydrogen and I will
01:08:53.279 give you what whatever power you require
01:08:55.479 to produce or to reach 5 million tons
01:08:57.880 per day so if somebody who is a 20year
01:09:00.158 old said the opportunity here is for me
01:09:02.880 to access these bids and subsidies by
01:09:06.319 getting electrolyzers in sure there's a
01:09:09.399 business there as well I don't think
01:09:11.640 there's even 10 to 20% that you can make
01:09:13.600 that you would probably be able to make
01:09:14.880 in solar because you would have to spend
01:09:16.880 a lot but according to me the
01:09:19.880 opportunity is in trying to create a
01:09:22.080 create massive dis option and there's a
01:09:25.000 lot of people working on making even
01:09:27.158 water splitting more efficient sea water
01:09:29.158 splitting for example i' I've heard so
01:09:31.920 much about it so you you need vocational
01:09:35.080 training more than an engineering degree
01:09:37.399 right now and if you could join the 20
01:09:41.640 companies that exist that help with this
01:09:43.960 it you'd be doing your bit I'm not sure
01:09:48.359 super really answers your question but
01:09:51.198 but very interesting no really should we
01:09:54.080 go to chaan next Chan would you like to
01:09:56.920 so I've known chaan a while each time I
01:09:58.960 meet him at a party or somebody else's
01:10:00.960 house I keep bugging him and asking him
01:10:02.960 questions it's become
01:10:05.159 like second nature but today I get to
01:10:08.400 bug you in isolation like get you stuck
01:10:11.800 in one location for many
01:10:13.880 hours so tell us a bit about your long
01:10:17.960 illustrious journey in EES by the way I
01:10:20.840 have to add this thing I called Anand uh
01:10:23.199 Mahindra for like I was just trying to
01:10:25.679 do research on this industry MH and then
01:10:28.120 I told him you're coming and he was like
01:10:30.440 Chan is like the Godfather of our
01:10:32.520 industry he started the he started this
01:10:36.360 off before E were a thing in India
01:10:39.400 before Tesla right when did you begin
01:10:41.520 first so I got into electrics in
01:10:45.800 1990 and I I know maybe I don't know if
01:10:48.440 you were B at
01:10:50.760 that no so I I got into uh
01:10:54.440 uh uh racing solar cars at when I was at
01:10:57.920 College wow and U we was part of the
01:11:01.480 team in Michigan and we raised from
01:11:03.040 Florida to Michigan and we came first in
01:11:07.000 in the US and uh GM sponsored us to uh
01:11:12.000 race in Australia for the world
01:11:13.679 championship so a bunch of 20 year olds
01:11:16.080 we raised a million bucks uh put a solar
01:11:19.120 car together and we raised from D raised
01:11:21.040 20 million bucks 1 million one yeah the
01:11:23.719 we raised 20 year olds but you know we
01:11:26.040 raised from Darin to Adelaide which is
01:11:27.760 3,200 km in the world
01:11:30.199 championship we came third in the world
01:11:33.400 um um Honda came in second and uh for me
01:11:38.840 that you could travel a continent on sun
01:11:42.080 energy was like wow this is the future
01:11:45.040 right so that's what I want to do so uh
01:11:48.840 um and fantastic name sorry it had a
01:11:52.080 fantastic name I think it's called
01:11:53.600 sunrunner sunrunner yeah yeah yeah um so
01:11:58.120 we're and then a bunch of us said that
01:12:01.440 when we graduate let's start something
01:12:03.760 in electric vehicles so five of us used
01:12:05.600 to meet and every uh two weeks and
01:12:08.880 decide on what business plans would come
01:12:10.960 out US the US and then one of my friends
01:12:14.320 father U was a PhD from calak he
01:12:17.000 invented the airbags and uh did a lot of
01:12:19.440 seat belt work and sold that company to
01:12:21.120 TRW he loved her IDE he was a mentor and
01:12:24.040 he says come and work for me so we all
01:12:26.080 ended up working in California in 91
01:12:28.480 doing electric vehicles um and uh I went
01:12:33.120 to grad school after that at Stanford
01:12:34.760 and I did a lot of work on hybrid
01:12:36.280 electric vehicles I felt that uh
01:12:38.920 electrics needed a host of uh electronic
01:12:42.199 software mechanical and that was a great
01:12:45.360 program that kind of combined all of the
01:12:47.679 stuff and went back this company already
01:12:49.880 gone public by then um and started doing
01:12:52.920 Electric veh vehicles with them in uh in
01:12:55.040 California and that's the time
01:12:57.239 California was switching from uh they
01:13:00.280 were the Aerospace industry was dying
01:13:02.520 and so they were switching it to uh EVS
01:13:05.880 so there was a big push from uh you know
01:13:08.199 both uh Bush Administration ler the
01:13:10.719 Clinton Administration to to get
01:13:12.480 electrics on that
01:13:13.880 front um and that's when the time when I
01:13:16.480 came back to work for him I said listen
01:13:17.920 I think the market my mentor I asked
01:13:20.520 told the market I think is going to be
01:13:22.040 on um
01:13:24.639 uh in India and China and in developing
01:13:27.480 countries and these Solutions we need
01:13:29.600 for these are different so we liked the
01:13:32.000 idea and the concept of Raa was born as
01:13:35.880 what I would initially call an Asian
01:13:37.480 electric vehicle for developing
01:13:40.000 countries um
01:13:42.320 and um post that as when did Raa launch
01:13:45.719 which year we launched in 201 2001 wow
01:13:48.920 so 22 22 years ago we developed in the
01:13:52.840 late '90s
01:13:53.880 right so it's um it was a very different
01:13:57.080 time then right cuz you just didn't you
01:13:58.679 didn't have people you didn't have
01:13:59.719 investors you didn't have the tech side
01:14:02.920 of it Rea started in 2001 yeah so um why
01:14:06.560 Raa the name my mother's
01:14:09.520 name no Rea
01:14:11.960 Rea means a new beginning in
01:14:14.760 Sanskrit I always thought Rea was like
01:14:17.719 Revolution once you get the marketing
01:14:19.719 guys is said Revolution electric vehicle
01:14:21.520 alternate the EV joined together
01:14:23.800 which almost every company uses that
01:14:25.520 same e that I we put 21 years ago I look
01:14:27.840 at them and go I thought we trademarked
01:14:29.880 that but seems like everyone's using
01:14:32.159 it anyways I was doing work in India and
01:14:35.320 the us at that point half the tech was
01:14:37.080 here half the tech was there so uh
01:14:39.719 honestly I'm technologist I wasn't an
01:14:41.560 entrepreneur right just to me I was
01:14:43.960 passionate about my tech side but then I
01:14:46.159 said okay to build the business I had to
01:14:48.480 become an
01:14:49.400 entrepreneur had a friend did teach me
01:14:52.239 how to put spread sheets to create a
01:14:53.920 business plan right and um try to go and
01:14:57.719 start to raise
01:14:59.360 capital and got some seed capital from
01:15:02.280 our family business uh IC what your
01:15:05.159 family business uh Automotive components
01:15:08.679 Aerospace electric Material Handling so
01:15:11.000 if you look at the golf carts and most
01:15:12.280 of the airports are from us so we've
01:15:13.639 been doing all of that for a while um
01:15:17.400 but this was uh quite different from
01:15:19.560 from that point of view and so I got
01:15:21.840 some seed Capital there I got
01:15:23.760 ICI and Technology development board mhm
01:15:27.040 which is hard because you know you're 29
01:15:30.080 and you ask someone that you want to get
01:15:32.280 money for electric vehicles in India and
01:15:33.960 the first thing they ask where does this
01:15:35.400 work in the world and um and to give a
01:15:38.679 29 year old that was you know I must say
01:15:42.080 was very good for those financial
01:15:44.040 institutions to give you debt at that
01:15:45.760 time because VC money and that was just
01:15:48.639 non-existent at that
01:15:51.040 point built that out and then um in 2001
01:15:54.600 we launched uh one month after we
01:15:57.120 launched the government pulled the plug
01:16:00.880 uh on subsidies and actually one month
01:16:04.040 before we launched and double the
01:16:05.600 taxation on electric vehicles why was
01:16:08.000 that and reduced taxes on petrol
01:16:09.679 Vehicles why
01:16:12.360 well look at who were the who are the
01:16:14.760 players at that time in the country and
01:16:17.560 it just you know it didn't feel I mean
01:16:20.000 people didn't want electrics to work
01:16:22.239 right and uh seriously yeah I always
01:16:24.480 thought that was just bureaucracy not
01:16:26.800 getting it no they were already
01:16:28.600 anti-electric at that point well think
01:16:30.560 about it one month before all of this
01:16:32.560 done all of that disappeared subsidies
01:16:35.400 that were there you built the business
01:16:37.000 on the fact that this was given and
01:16:38.639 confirmed so who got the subsidy if they
01:16:41.120 if you guys weren't live in the market
01:16:42.800 who really got the nobody got it they
01:16:44.480 just killed the whole subsidy without
01:16:46.280 giving it to anybody they given anyone
01:16:48.040 and they also increase taxes this 2000
01:16:52.080 2001 m
01:16:55.000 right so Global financial crisis it was
01:16:57.199 a it was a it was a big issue and so I
01:17:00.040 think the the only way to survive was
01:17:03.440 actually looking at Global markets so we
01:17:05.400 actually went to 24 countries UK was my
01:17:07.360 largest market in 2005 2006 um Tesla
01:17:11.600 raised money from um Draper others did
01:17:15.440 so you know Draper fish invester us
01:17:17.320 amongst others so there was a bit of
01:17:18.639 clean tech Capital coming out in 2005
01:17:20.960 2006 the first signs of clean tech
01:17:23.560 right if you remember that you know the
01:17:25.600 VC industry was changing a bit so we got
01:17:27.560 some VC money and then in 2010 was at
01:17:31.679 the Frankford motor show we were
01:17:32.719 showcasing on new products only Indian
01:17:34.560 company and everyone was talking billion
01:17:36.679 dollar Investments right Tesla had
01:17:37.840 already got a billion Nissan was talking
01:17:39.800 1.5 GM was talking 2 billion and I said
01:17:42.840 this needs a different level of
01:17:44.920 Investments but still hard to combine
01:17:47.600 India and I found ourselves very good in
01:17:51.080 Tech so I licensed our entire technology
01:17:53.520 to General Motors so we showcase this
01:17:56.080 electric spark platform in 2010 at the
01:17:58.400 order show um but a few three months
01:18:01.960 later GM got bought by saic in China and
01:18:06.280 so you know they changed their strategy
01:18:08.120 and that's the time I spoke with with
01:18:10.040 Anand and and initially what started as
01:18:12.400 a technology licensing went to um you
01:18:16.239 know getting a majority of the company
01:18:18.159 in 2010 and to me the vision was more
01:18:21.000 important you know can we build Electric
01:18:23.520 Mobility at scale and uh you know ran
01:18:27.760 that till
01:18:28.920 2015 um built up a bunch of products on
01:18:31.920 seven products from mandra on their
01:18:34.000 platform got them into also racing so
01:18:36.440 you see the mandra like racing I started
01:18:38.199 that business too um and then um uh you
01:18:43.199 know steep down to kind of think rethink
01:18:45.880 because it was a long
01:18:47.520 time and that's when idea of sun
01:18:50.000 Mobility came up to um to start looking
01:18:52.679 at
01:18:53.480 kind of the questions we've been talking
01:18:55.120 about right range anxiety cost refueling
01:18:58.920 time so I said if you could actually
01:19:00.920 solve these
01:19:02.320 problems um there's going to be a huge
01:19:05.760 opportunity right and the second part
01:19:09.000 was where is the opportunity is it going
01:19:11.600 to be at the OEM level I felt that the
01:19:14.280 business system of the future going to
01:19:15.880 be in energy right can you democratize
01:19:18.400 energy in a way that's quite different
01:19:20.960 and then where do you focus on that
01:19:22.360 front right and two and three wheelers
01:19:24.960 were 80% almost of India so can you give
01:19:27.960 one solution for all of that so right
01:19:30.800 and the second was bus and trucks which
01:19:32.560 is 2% of India but 50% of the emissions
01:19:35.760 and energy right so in a way it was
01:19:38.040 departure from personal cars to saying
01:19:41.280 where is the biggest impact in society
01:19:43.719 where's the largest business in
01:19:45.800 energy and in those businesses um as an
01:19:50.560 energy player the economics made sense
01:19:52.480 if you gave a customer something that
01:19:53.840 was 20% cheaper to buy and and 20%
01:19:56.880 cheaper to operate right then there's a
01:19:59.440 fundamental shift in them adopting and
01:20:02.840 then there's a fundamental shift in
01:20:04.520 sustainability right eventually it's D
01:20:06.760 it came from that and so STI was started
01:20:11.000 trying to look at the fact that we can
01:20:12.560 make cost we can make it cheaper that
01:20:14.760 was the hypothesis I spent a year going
01:20:17.440 around the world which is a great time
01:20:19.719 to take a time off and understood why
01:20:22.360 soap worked and why it didn't work right
01:20:27.000 and and trying to see the tech that
01:20:29.159 needed to it um I spent 3 months
01:20:33.719 understanding what to do in Bangalore
01:20:35.120 for the buses for bmtc and try to see
01:20:38.199 what solutions would work and did fast
01:20:40.199 charging did slow charging did swapping
01:20:43.719 and realized that the economics and
01:20:45.120 swapping would work much better so and
01:20:47.280 to riar and Delhi so it was a real
01:20:49.880 insight and then the tech was very
01:20:51.560 critical so spent a year filed my first
01:20:54.840 patents and then started a company with
01:20:56.800 my partner with Kar um who's a very
01:21:00.080 passionate around climate change so what
01:21:01.400 brought us together was that he us into
01:21:04.159 Renewables uh I went into Mobility Sun
01:21:07.000 Mobility is where I started racing solar
01:21:09.920 cars it's also his family side of it so
01:21:12.880 everything came together with the name
01:21:14.520 and what we wanted to do is how do we
01:21:16.000 run the world with this so so M started
01:21:18.679 with that ethos of really addressing
01:21:20.760 these these aspects there can you tell
01:21:22.520 us a bit more about that what are you
01:21:24.199 guys doing at Sun Mobility so what we do
01:21:26.440 is that um um we've taken two parts
01:21:30.040 let's start with the micr mobility mhm
01:21:32.400 and uh if you sell a vehicle Sans a
01:21:36.000 battery without the battery the cost of
01:21:37.600 the vehicle can be cheaper than internal
01:21:39.320 combustion engine vehicle right so we
01:21:41.280 heard that the cost of batteries are 30%
01:21:43.679 in some form factors it could be 50% in
01:21:45.840 buses and trucks it could be even 60%
01:21:47.880 right so depending on where you are
01:21:49.639 between 30 to 60% so would be the cost
01:21:52.159 of battery
01:21:53.280 so if you remove the battery battery
01:21:54.639 management system even the charging
01:21:56.000 system then the cost the any IC vehicle
01:21:58.800 any electric vehicle can be cheaper than
01:22:00.280 an ice vehicle any form factor today and
01:22:03.880 if you look at the amortized cost of
01:22:06.560 energy battery and the cost of energy is
01:22:09.159 cheaper than fuel MH and then if you
01:22:11.480 think of I can swap it in a minute then
01:22:13.880 you address both the range anxiety and
01:22:15.520 the real fueling time so the concept is
01:22:18.600 to create battery as a service right but
01:22:21.760 then create it across a common solution
01:22:24.360 across all platforms so we took two
01:22:27.840 wheelers use one battery smaller riar
01:22:30.239 use two larger loaders use three and
01:22:33.159 something like a Tata Ace would use four
01:22:35.159 batteries so anything from scooter to up
01:22:38.400 to 2 tons which is 80% of India could
01:22:41.360 use one battery and one infrastructure
01:22:43.960 solutioning right and and work across
01:22:46.880 this form so that was the idea around
01:22:49.199 the
01:22:50.520 micromobility then we have solutions for
01:22:52.560 trucks and buses that go from 5 tons to
01:22:55.400 55 tons and we use modular batteries um
01:22:59.080 that can allow you to have one or two
01:23:00.679 batteries to get you different range
01:23:02.120 formats right again you can today have a
01:23:04.960 truck or a bus that's cheaper than a
01:23:07.280 regular electric truck or bus cheaper
01:23:09.320 and you can address range anxiety so if
01:23:12.040 you think of in a city you're doing your
01:23:14.360 roots right uh in a city like
01:23:17.960 Bangalore um 92% of your rots are under
01:23:20.920 40 kilm
01:23:23.080 right but you do average 200 km a day so
01:23:26.159 actually why do you carry a 3- ton
01:23:28.239 battery when you can carry a 600
01:23:30.360 kilogram batteries so it's 2.5 tons
01:23:32.520 lighter right and which means your
01:23:35.600 Energy Efficiency is 10 to 15% better
01:23:38.800 and you can use a much smaller battery
01:23:40.800 and the batter is the most expensive
01:23:42.280 thing so you cut down the cost of the
01:23:43.840 battery and and do a third or so and you
01:23:47.719 C cut down the cost of the station
01:23:49.920 because of the high utilization and so
01:23:52.000 the econom omics work out much better
01:23:54.639 these also very long life batteries so
01:23:56.760 in scooters and trucks we as scooters
01:23:59.560 they last probably around 3,000 plus
01:24:01.639 Cycles so you're making the battery or
01:24:03.960 yes and also what is battery swapping
01:24:07.120 when my batter is out of charge do they
01:24:08.880 come to your yes service point no so
01:24:12.000 today we have uh we have around 600
01:24:14.880 touch points mhm uh in Delhi we have a
01:24:17.960 little over 400 we have a station at
01:24:19.639 every 2 kilometers right we by the next
01:24:22.880 couple of months we'll have
01:24:24.920 more touch points than all petrol
01:24:27.600 stations put together so it's really
01:24:29.760 accessible within 2 kilometers you can
01:24:31.520 go to any network right um iOS is our
01:24:34.800 partner so we are at Indian oil petrol
01:24:36.960 stations here and there so it's easy to
01:24:38.520 access but they're at Metro stations
01:24:40.520 they're independent sites they're at
01:24:42.199 franchise Partners so can someone like
01:24:44.600 blue smart use this Teck uh yes they can
01:24:47.280 but that's for cars we haven't done it I
01:24:48.920 think in cars uh for for services like
01:24:52.360 what they're using of shared mobility
01:24:53.840 and taxis swapping makes a lot of sense
01:24:56.360 and E uh definitely good but there's a
01:25:00.920 there's you know we've today started the
01:25:03.679 business in the two and three wheelers
01:25:05.520 around shared Mobility because these
01:25:07.360 people are driving a lot so it makes a
01:25:09.440 lot of sense because our earnings are
01:25:10.960 higher personal Mobility people drive
01:25:13.560 less so the models have to change
01:25:15.719 slightly but there's no technology issue
01:25:17.600 for example if you look at a country
01:25:19.960 like
01:25:21.280 Taiwan in 92% of all electric two-
01:25:24.960 wheelers are with swapable Solutions
01:25:27.639 right just by one company but it gives a
01:25:30.000 solution to multiple companies so the
01:25:31.280 solution is working at scale um this
01:25:35.119 year 50% of all electric trucks in China
01:25:39.080 were with softable batteries right that
01:25:41.520 Target was supposed to be achieved in 27
01:25:43.360 so you're seeing now at scale this
01:25:45.560 happening from small form factors to
01:25:47.719 large form factors so you you have two
01:25:50.719 models you have battery as a service and
01:25:52.440 Mobility is a service battery is a
01:25:54.360 service we've partnered with over 15
01:25:56.159 oems mhm so you can walk into an oem
01:25:58.760 showroom say in this case you want to
01:26:00.719 buy a three-wheeler you walk into see a
01:26:02.040 PR or showroom you buy the vehicle right
01:26:04.960 without the battery and like you buy a
01:26:07.719 smartphone without your sim card right
01:26:09.960 and then you sign up for on our platform
01:26:12.480 the dealer himself sets you up um you
01:26:14.760 have an RFID Card you have a wallet you
01:26:16.960 go to any station you can then just swap
01:26:19.080 your batteries and you only charge for
01:26:20.960 the energy you use so use half the
01:26:22.560 battery you get charge only for half the
01:26:24.000 energy that you use we have both pay as
01:26:26.440 you go models and subscription models
01:26:28.800 right and these are these work out
01:26:30.440 cheaper than even CG as a fuel right and
01:26:33.600 the cost of the three-wheeler today when
01:26:35.440 you walk into a showroom is cheaper than
01:26:36.639 a CG vehicle so and we do this without
01:26:39.960 subsidies right sustainable are there
01:26:42.040 subsidies for this if you buy it and as
01:26:45.040 a Mobility ass Serv come to but as
01:26:46.880 battery I found that 10,000 CR subsidy
01:26:49.199 thousand is for charging yeah so there's
01:26:51.400 so there's there's supposed to be this
01:26:54.040 right but again policy Lunas come one
01:26:56.960 and this is one another big policy Gap
01:26:59.360 the government has right on this front
01:27:02.320 the second is mobility service where we
01:27:03.960 found a lot of fleets want to go
01:27:05.159 electric and they don't want to deal
01:27:06.920 with the infra they just want to go and
01:27:08.400 when they cross 50 Vehicles they found
01:27:10.080 it very challenging to run their fleets
01:27:12.280 so we give them the vehicle the energy
01:27:15.000 data and the whole service associated
01:27:17.320 with it uh for on a cost per month basis
01:27:21.000 right so today maybe have only on
01:27:23.480 Mobility service we have a little over
01:27:25.119 15,000 vehicles um with Fleet providers
01:27:28.400 who in turn are using them to deliver to
01:27:30.800 Amazon and flip carts and everyone else
01:27:32.719 right you also have infrastructure at
01:27:34.719 Amazon sites and who's the biggest
01:27:36.400 client in terms
01:27:38.159 of um they would be partners for am so
01:27:41.600 they' be like a zip or zingo and a bunch
01:27:43.719 of other all these uh so we on 55 Fleet
01:27:46.760 customers today they may have fleets
01:27:48.560 from 50 to maybe 3,000 vehicles and of
01:27:51.600 our vehicles on their platform right um
01:27:54.520 and they can go to market very quickly
01:27:56.520 right we we in sometime some months can
01:27:58.600 put, 1500 vehicles on a fleet in a month
01:28:01.199 which is very difficult for them to go
01:28:03.119 on right and now their Roots change they
01:28:05.920 have no issue on Range anxiety right
01:28:08.440 swapping anytime they want and and it's
01:28:10.800 all inclusive right so that's both
01:28:13.199 battery of service and Mobility as
01:28:14.880 service business here and then um you
01:28:17.320 know and trucks and buses on that
01:28:20.280 front is that a viable
01:28:22.960 solution for you guys to collaborate
01:28:24.719 with swapping
01:28:27.040 mhm very few things would ever disagree
01:28:31.679 on we haven't been able to agree on
01:28:33.600 swapping yet uh we've been chatting for
01:28:35.480 a few years why
01:28:38.560 uh funnily we were actually originally
01:28:40.880 big Believers of swapping mhm the first
01:28:42.760 patent we filed at ather was a swapable
01:28:44.480 battery pack mhm so and a lot of the
01:28:47.480 first early hires at e were all hired to
01:28:49.639 build swapping stations and swapable
01:28:51.159 battery packs mhm
01:28:54.080 what we figured eventually is um for a
01:28:57.280 lot of practical reasons our customers
01:28:58.960 weren't willing to swap a battery what
01:29:02.119 was happening is and it's like we can
01:29:04.639 talk about cost we can talk about tech
01:29:06.480 product all that later isn't the battery
01:29:08.800 inside how do you open it up to so
01:29:11.800 especially building a more premium
01:29:12.920 vehicle what you kind of realized is and
01:29:14.880 um I remember having this conversation
01:29:17.119 back at home with my
01:29:18.719 family because the idea initially was
01:29:20.800 very like like very powerful it it
01:29:23.760 totally is it's very hard to not not
01:29:26.280 fall in love with it um in fact I think
01:29:29.840 a Ras my CD funding by saying it's
01:29:31.400 swapable battery pack we'll get you
01:29:33.320 there you're going to all turn around
01:29:35.400 let me hear you out first I'm I'm
01:29:37.520 acknowledging that I have believed in it
01:29:39.080 for lot of for a long time the early
01:29:41.600 designs were actually all with swapable
01:29:43.639 battery pack um we thought of robotic
01:29:47.080 stations and everything what happened is
01:29:48.560 I had this chat at home and um everybody
01:29:51.679 like did until I ask them until they ask
01:29:55.880 me how will the swapping happen and I
01:29:59.600 said you will take the battery out and
01:30:01.040 you will put it on station and put
01:30:02.159 another one out and put it in oh yeah
01:30:04.360 makes sense and how heavy is the battery
01:30:07.639 and then we ran into issues so I said
01:30:09.320 obviously we'll break the battery into
01:30:10.880 two parts how heavy is the battery 20
01:30:13.159 kgs so we'll break the battery into two
01:30:14.600 parts right uh so you'll only have to
01:30:16.960 lift like 10 kgs at a time Max maybe
01:30:19.159 eight also and I realized no nobody was
01:30:22.400 very excited about it MH and very
01:30:25.360 quickly it was
01:30:27.159 like Papa I can't mother can't but Dad
01:30:32.239 has a back issue so maybe
01:30:38.960 sister and I very quickly realized the
01:30:40.880 only way to actually solve this problem
01:30:42.280 because most Indian consumers were not
01:30:43.960 willing to do a manual swap see the
01:30:45.400 example that Chan talked about very
01:30:47.280 powerful uh
01:30:49.199 Taiwan the Taiwanese customers willing
01:30:51.239 to do a manual swap they're willing to
01:30:53.080 lift up that 89 kg battery 1 half 8 kgs
01:30:57.320 pull it up slide it in a rack pull on
01:30:59.880 the 8 kg cylinder out slide it in
01:31:02.320 without breaking anything do this twice
01:31:04.719 every couple of days but I realized that
01:31:07.440 the Indian customer personal consumer
01:31:09.719 like absolutely Fleet consumers will do
01:31:11.280 it in a heartbeat like it's it's a no
01:31:13.600 Now personal personal users were not
01:31:16.040 super excited about doing it and the
01:31:19.000 only way to run the entire solution for
01:31:21.320 them was have an attendant at the
01:31:22.880 station who would do the manual swap for
01:31:25.400 them but the minute you introduce an
01:31:27.520 attendant cost as a company in this
01:31:30.239 entire
01:31:31.760 infrastructure everything just stops
01:31:33.560 making sense that's what happened to us
01:31:36.320 then we ran to a second issue again not
01:31:37.800 cost
01:31:38.679 Rel so we ran this very small experiment
01:31:41.960 like I was just basically I would do
01:31:43.280 these a lot of these uh like these mock
01:31:46.159 protos right like like have the consumer
01:31:49.560 just walk through the experience and see
01:31:51.480 at what point do their eyes break
01:31:53.080 contact like you know when do they
01:31:54.400 switch off and uh I was walking through
01:31:57.480 somebody this experience and I realized
01:31:58.920 the person was I just bought the scooter
01:32:02.520 brand new
01:32:03.760 scooter on Sunday Monday I go to a swap
01:32:07.119 station and I'm going to change my
01:32:09.320 battery when do I get my battery back
01:32:11.159 I'm like never right like your battery
01:32:13.280 is a commodity like just think of it as
01:32:14.639 petrol
01:32:15.679 right we'll give you a battery it's
01:32:17.600 fully charged full
01:32:19.760 range not full range because listen
01:32:22.040 obviously life will deplete you will not
01:32:23.520 always have 100% battery after 3 Years
01:32:25.760 it'll be at 80% but you will get 80 85%
01:32:28.600 generally that that's not fair no I just
01:32:31.040 bought a brand new scooter you so you
01:32:32.440 told me 100 km of range on Sunday on
01:32:34.719 Monday you give me something at 85 km of
01:32:36.639 range a threey old
01:32:38.199 battery and I was just
01:32:45.600 playing this I can't solve this problem
01:32:48.080 like it is possibly solvable right but I
01:32:51.440 can't can't solve this the Indian like I
01:32:53.320 have to fight so many other battles with
01:32:54.600 the Indian consumer today about
01:32:56.880 electric premium
01:32:59.360 connected if I add that you don't own
01:33:02.440 the battery your range will be plus
01:33:04.239 minus
01:33:05.719 20% and you will have to do a manual
01:33:08.480 swap mhm I realized like I'm just
01:33:11.119 guaranteeing this our business will fail
01:33:13.159 the way we have set up so we pulled out
01:33:16.000 of it which is why we haven't agreed yet
01:33:18.639 yet so Counterpoint to that all all all
01:33:21.679 valid stuff so we started with we
01:33:24.119 started with shared Mobility where where
01:33:27.920 um you know uh where the problem is
01:33:30.239 lesser there's not an issue at all right
01:33:32.840 and when you start with personal
01:33:34.639 Mobility you know and you're selling
01:33:36.679 your first 100 scooters you can't put
01:33:39.159 infra all around the city because the
01:33:41.000 guy's going to say where do I have it
01:33:43.440 but once infra is in
01:33:45.239 place 500 stations in Delhi right we
01:33:48.320 have 100 in Bangalore there 85 LPG
01:33:50.719 stations in Bangalore we have 100 which
01:33:52.480 G to 200,000 we have 100 stations here
01:33:55.719 suddenly you're saying hey I see the one
01:33:57.440 outside my office I see one outside my
01:33:59.040 work I see on some kids school now I'm
01:34:01.320 thinking differently so for us it's a
01:34:03.320 journey you start with shared Mobility
01:34:06.239 MH you in because there you're putting
01:34:08.880 500 Vehicles someone you put the
01:34:10.320 infrastructure up once you have enough
01:34:12.880 infrastructure then there's an
01:34:14.360 opportunity to look at personability
01:34:16.400 there's several other things that we
01:34:17.719 have learned also around the way right
01:34:19.280 one is that the we a million swaps a
01:34:22.719 month so there is enough consumer
01:34:24.560 experience I probably agree with him
01:34:26.560 that for personal Mobility you mean he
01:34:28.159 need slightly lighter batteries you have
01:34:30.400 you know different segments of the
01:34:32.080 population and shared Mobility is more
01:34:34.719 willing to do it but that's okay it's
01:34:36.600 not about it's not technology issue it's
01:34:39.280 just what you would uh adapt to for that
01:34:41.760 application so that's not not an issue
01:34:44.000 at all um the second thing is that if
01:34:47.960 you walked into a showroom right and the
01:34:50.719 customer you had a scooter that was 1.5
01:34:55.080 lakhs or
01:34:56.560 so um it' probably be 75 to 80k if you
01:35:00.480 remove the battery a 4 kilowatt battery
01:35:02.360 if there was that and a charger and
01:35:04.239 everything else right now you could tell
01:35:06.840 the person do you want to buy something
01:35:08.239 at 75 80k or
01:35:10.480 1.5 right so the but the performance is
01:35:13.880 identical the speed is identical the
01:35:16.040 acceleration is identical the
01:35:17.600 connectivity is identical you can't even
01:35:19.280 tell the difference between the two
01:35:20.679 scooters mhm right what would you buy
01:35:23.440 now let the consumer make that decision
01:35:26.159 right so what we found with a lot of
01:35:28.440 oems is they have a petrol they have a
01:35:31.040 diesel they have a CNG they have an LPG
01:35:33.320 they have an electric it's swappable and
01:35:35.280 they have electric INF fixed and in some
01:35:37.600 markets 70% of the sales are electric
01:35:40.080 with
01:35:40.800 swappable right which is means consumers
01:35:44.000 are walking into a showroom have options
01:35:46.080 and decide right now 80% of India
01:35:52.159 doesn't have INF fried home right today
01:35:55.719 when you start in the premium Market
01:35:57.280 you're capturing the 10% then the 15
01:35:59.800 then the 20 but once you go if I ask you
01:36:03.880 know a staff and here and you know when
01:36:06.040 you go when you Parks you know my M she
01:36:07.920 say I bought a new scooter but I park
01:36:10.960 200 M away from where I have to go and I
01:36:13.199 don't have infra so I not bought
01:36:14.960 electric right so as you start to go to
01:36:17.840 scale intra becomes an issue right and
01:36:21.400 that's when the swapping really adds it
01:36:23.080 because it's one minute to do it right
01:36:24.840 so it solves that problem for you the
01:36:27.480 third reason in my in my you know 15 20
01:36:30.719 years is everyone was concerned what
01:36:32.400 happen to battery life I bought the
01:36:34.800 scooter I bought a vehicle it's giving
01:36:37.480 me a three-year warranty maybe an
01:36:39.199 extended warranty five I would pay a lot
01:36:41.320 more against it but if it goes bad I
01:36:44.239 have a huge expense towards it right and
01:36:47.920 and unfortunately because of the
01:36:49.440 Taxation and everything else in India
01:36:51.800 a battery replacement cost could be 30%
01:36:54.480 more than an oem cost structure right so
01:36:56.560 that really adds a huge cost right so
01:36:59.239 this battery could be 880,000 plus for a
01:37:01.639 replacement battery when someone hears
01:37:03.600 that they say oh are telling me I have
01:37:05.080 to spend that much money that period of
01:37:07.000 time so that's another deterrent why
01:37:09.159 they do that on the other side can I ask
01:37:12.040 you a question like if you have the
01:37:14.119 inventory of batteries that you're
01:37:15.840 swapping now and let's say the life
01:37:18.320 cycle of a battery is 8 years 10 years
01:37:20.400 whatever the number it's much less for
01:37:22.480 us the re I mean the reason is actually
01:37:24.840 that was I was going to the reason is we
01:37:26.639 swap we swap a lot more right so our
01:37:29.080 batteries are swapping say twice a day
01:37:31.360 right so you know our batteries are
01:37:32.960 3,000 Cycles they last us 5 years but
01:37:35.400 we're using it a lot more every day
01:37:37.239 right so it's a long life battery so
01:37:38.880 what do you do with the inventory as a
01:37:40.679 business no we have around 1.2 so for
01:37:43.560 every battery in the field you have
01:37:45.080 around 20% in our stations and Beyond 3
01:37:47.560 years will everything be running at x%
01:37:50.119 of the efficiency today so so our
01:37:52.159 customer promise is that it's 80% you'd
01:37:55.960 always get that much right but there's a
01:37:57.920 very another interesting Insight right
01:38:00.080 you've we've um we you know 6 months ago
01:38:04.400 introduced a battery that's 45% more
01:38:06.880 capacity okay a customers that's loving
01:38:10.280 it because they over last two years had
01:38:13.080 range and now they have 40% more range
01:38:15.760 45% more range they're paying on the
01:38:18.320 same amount per kilowatt hour so for
01:38:20.280 energy they're paying the same but they
01:38:21.599 have performance how do you monetize
01:38:22.840 this who is paying for it so you're
01:38:24.719 doing B2B yeah so as
01:38:27.880 B2B and b2c in b2c you're going in
01:38:32.040 you're using certain amount of energy
01:38:33.719 you pay per kilowatt hour of energy
01:38:35.199 you've used right if you're B2B I've
01:38:37.800 included so you're not paying per swap
01:38:39.800 you're paying per swap but or are you
01:38:41.360 paying per kilometer driven you're
01:38:43.119 paying per energy use so think about it
01:38:45.760 kilometer driven I'm giving you one
01:38:47.400 liter of petrol you may drive at 15 kilm
01:38:50.000 per liter someone may drive at 10 I want
01:38:51.480 me drive at 20 so I can't give you on a
01:38:53.520 kilometer per liter I can give you as a
01:38:55.719 unit of energy so like rupees per
01:38:57.880 kilometer rupees per liter I'm giving
01:38:59.920 you rupees per kilowatt or
01:39:01.840 consume we're digital and it's to the
01:39:04.080 third digit because it's all electronic
01:39:06.080 so exactly how much they've used comes
01:39:08.000 on their screen comes on their app comes
01:39:10.760 on their SMS when they get their invoice
01:39:13.080 and that's how much they've used they
01:39:14.320 only charge for that much so that's this
01:39:16.440 this part of it but what's very
01:39:18.520 interesting
01:39:19.560 is we've had customers who' done you
01:39:22.520 know 1.5 lakh of kilometers on their
01:39:25.440 three-wheelers and their friend bought
01:39:27.320 one with a fixed battery and after 3
01:39:28.960 years they had to spent a lack of rupees
01:39:30.800 in replacement right and the battery
01:39:33.280 capacity started at 100 and in three
01:39:35.159 years dropped around 65% because in you
01:39:37.360 you know Fleet usage you you use a lot
01:39:39.800 more than probably personal in this case
01:39:42.119 this customer after 3 years has got a
01:39:43.840 battery that's 40% better right now in
01:39:46.840 two years a year from today it's going
01:39:48.239 to get another 10% so in the 10year
01:39:50.639 Lifey cycle of their vehicle their their
01:39:53.119 vehicle has gotten better every year
01:39:56.080 right whereas you're buying something a
01:39:58.520 depreciating asset that goes bad so when
01:40:01.199 you start to think of all of this right
01:40:04.520 but it's not a silver bullet every
01:40:08.000 solution is going to coexist right slow
01:40:11.599 charging fast charging swapping are all
01:40:14.400 going to coexist right it depends on the
01:40:17.000 customer and their choice of what they'd
01:40:19.159 like to do would they like to they have
01:40:21.000 infrastructure at home they don't mind
01:40:22.239 paying more they don't like to go
01:40:23.920 somewhere else they like to charge at
01:40:25.360 home that would make
01:40:27.119 sense so each one depending on the
01:40:29.480 customers's requirement but finally the
01:40:31.239 cost structures are far more uh you know
01:40:34.320 beneficial right and also the benefit of
01:40:36.679 never have to worry the battery when
01:40:39.239 someone picks up a scooter or any
01:40:42.159 vehicle my big insight has been that
01:40:44.560 they buy the
01:40:46.280 vehicle when they buy the vehicle they
01:40:48.480 always think of 1% of their usage not 9
01:40:51.679 99% 99% of the time they're doing less
01:40:54.239 than 40 km a day but that 1% of the time
01:40:58.480 they've got an extra trip for school
01:41:00.840 with their spouse an extra call and they
01:41:04.000 may have done 100 MH and when they do
01:41:06.520 100 right they're looking at at least
01:41:08.840 having 120
01:41:10.320 kilometers and then they derate whatever
01:41:13.440 the OEM says unless it's ather where you
01:41:16.159 actually the other way around where
01:41:17.239 ather gives you a very good I mean
01:41:18.960 they're very transparent which is very
01:41:20.400 good they build that up right but that's
01:41:22.199 an exception to the norm in the industry
01:41:24.080 here today right so now suddenly if you
01:41:26.480 want that much range you probably need a
01:41:28.520 4 kilowatt pack for a scooter right and
01:41:33.679 even at $120 a battery pack that's $480
01:41:36.920 $500 with charger and everything it
01:41:39.800 maybe you know it's more than 50% of the
01:41:41.920 bill of materials so wherever it goes
01:41:44.560 it's going to be a very large chunk on
01:41:47.159 this front and then the other challenge
01:41:48.920 in scooters and three-wheelers in India
01:41:51.320 is that you can't cool them very
01:41:53.239 difficult you can't have air
01:41:54.239 conditioning is it the batteries that
01:41:55.760 you can't air condition well the battery
01:41:57.199 life at 45 degrees of battery life could
01:41:59.560 be maybe a third or half of and these
01:42:01.760 batteries are they imported or are they
01:42:03.719 made in India so today the cells are
01:42:06.360 imported today the most companies would
01:42:09.159 import the cell and make the packs ather
01:42:11.920 does that we do that right uh I think in
01:42:14.440 the next 24 months cells will start
01:42:16.239 being produced in India right and maybe
01:42:18.880 in 48 months we'll have a reasonable
01:42:20.840 chunk but still a lot on the cell side
01:42:24.639 like like what what you talked about you
01:42:27.000 know the panels and and the and and the
01:42:29.639 cells pan and panels um but that value
01:42:33.360 is pretty high for a two- wheeler right
01:42:35.400 because the packs are smaller so that
01:42:37.679 added value could be 40% or so to 30 to
01:42:40.679 40% oh it's lesser now much lesser it's
01:42:43.560 approaching what cars were at model
01:42:46.639 actually I should have framed that
01:42:47.840 question to you and not to you CU you're
01:42:49.760 more he's more B2B right so shopping in
01:42:52.360 our case won't work I mean so I I'll
01:42:54.280 tell you my thought cars are premium
01:42:55.760 products people who buy cars they they
01:42:58.920 want they they're not the ones going to
01:43:00.920 pull out a 40 Kow battery or 60 Kow
01:43:03.119 battery of the car right they want ease
01:43:04.800 they want Comfort that's not a two-
01:43:06.159 wheeler nobody whether Fleet operator
01:43:08.400 like Blu smart or individual person
01:43:10.280 wants a discomfort of swapping a battery
01:43:12.639 because you B you bought a car for a
01:43:13.920 reason right and your cars don't have
01:43:15.440 utility for 24 hours not I'm just
01:43:17.920 setting the contest coming there as more
01:43:20.320 and more Global oems I speak to in the
01:43:22.320 US or in Europe or in India mhm they all
01:43:25.239 of this thought process that uh and like
01:43:27.679 even thir mentioned that nobody wants to
01:43:30.040 probably replace a new battery with a
01:43:31.880 old one they were not so attracted
01:43:35.800 towards building a car with swapping
01:43:37.599 where you take the battery out and
01:43:39.320 change the good part about the good news
01:43:41.679 for us is that the range of the car is
01:43:43.800 going up right and the range of the
01:43:45.639 batter is going up you don't need today
01:43:48.040 I mean for inity purposes you don't need
01:43:50.719 need uh batteries which are more than
01:43:53.599 like 80 KW hour or or or 60 Kow hour
01:43:57.040 storage and that will give you nearly
01:43:58.320 500 700 km I mean we have um companies
01:44:01.480 which are today or large Brands which
01:44:03.639 are promising 700 km 600 km single
01:44:06.400 charge but you the consumption doesn't
01:44:08.599 happen with personal Mobility even if
01:44:10.320 you look at Fleet operators like blue
01:44:12.040 smart for intas City purposes within the
01:44:15.080 city even if NCR you see I mean you
01:44:17.400 can't exhaust more than 300 km so
01:44:19.679 swapping doesn't make sense for us I
01:44:21.400 mean I mean that's what our thought is
01:44:23.400 globally I mean just I'm just telling
01:44:24.679 our thought process of other Fleet
01:44:26.280 operators that we speak to reel in the
01:44:28.080 US who is also using Tesla Model y car
01:44:31.000 for running a fleet like Blu smart they
01:44:32.560 are equivalent to Blu Smart in the
01:44:34.280 US best part about it is now the cost so
01:44:37.239 if I were to now go back to unit
01:44:38.840 economics and say you look you know
01:44:42.080 Apple to Apple if I bought a swift
01:44:44.040 desire for 78 lakh rupees I mean now the
01:44:46.599 new Swift desire apparently cost Ender
01:44:48.840 from 6 and a half lakhs to 8 lakh rupes
01:44:50.320 today you you can't get a sft desire
01:44:52.199 below 8 Lakes a good loaded one with bs6
01:44:55.119 Norms a tataa car I will have to Shell
01:44:57.920 out 4 lakh rupees more three and a half
01:44:59.920 lakh rupees more in the Kix so so you
01:45:01.599 are saying that look my Kix is high here
01:45:03.440 it comes with the battery my Kix is low
01:45:06.199 here it doesn't it doesn't have a
01:45:07.599 battery here right now but look at the
01:45:09.360 utilization if I were to use 1 lakh
01:45:11.360 kilometers and pay on an average between
01:45:14.520 CNG and petrol and Diesel a mix of about
01:45:17.960 6 rupees per per kilometer I'm sure sing
01:45:20.719 out 6 lakh rupees on fuel for running
01:45:23.280 the car uh for a lakh kilometers which
01:45:26.480 is the consumption is about 14 months or
01:45:28.239 about 15 months the same consumption on
01:45:30.960 electric I will have to pay a footer
01:45:32.880 bill of 80,000 to 1 lakh rupees so the
01:45:36.560 additional amount I paid for the car I I
01:45:38.840 got back in 14 months just in the fuel
01:45:40.719 cost so the additional amount I paid for
01:45:43.599 buying that electric vehicle with that
01:45:46.719 additional battery I recovered that in
01:45:48.599 just 14 months because my operating cost
01:45:51.040 was low so so I'm happy to pay for that
01:45:52.719 battery up front and utilize that over
01:45:54.920 14 months and then I'm on par in 14
01:45:56.880 months time and then then I can continue
01:45:59.080 to run my car charge my car at ease as
01:46:01.719 per utilization but swapping for
01:46:03.320 four-wheelers for cars I think can I ask
01:46:06.920 a questiones without without battery
01:46:09.360 swapping if you want to transport
01:46:11.560 something from Bangalore to Goa which is
01:46:13.239 1,000 kilometers how do you do it I mean
01:46:15.679 you need to you need to charges in
01:46:17.159 between and stop for example and how
01:46:19.360 long will it take to charge a truck
01:46:21.360 truck a truck will likely have 500 km of
01:46:23.719 range you will stop once for about 3
01:46:26.080 hours you will do not a full fast charge
01:46:28.599 you will do basically a hybrid fast
01:46:29.920 charge typically when these buses trucks
01:46:33.239 charge they're using 3 hours to charge
01:46:35.719 the
01:46:36.800 battery and and what you're doing is
01:46:39.840 you're by swapping over over 16 hours
01:46:42.599 you're using an energy over 16 hours
01:46:44.719 where Each truck would use it over 3
01:46:46.239 hours so in a way you think about it the
01:46:49.719 grid power that you need Peak power is
01:46:52.639 almost 3x more and we found this when we
01:46:55.840 did a pilot in Amad with 18 buses with
01:46:59.239 fixed charging and swapping the buses
01:47:01.639 with fixed charging would charge over
01:47:03.400 four hours at night and they would swap
01:47:05.320 the charges out of four us for the other
01:47:07.000 buses and the same buses were taken care
01:47:09.599 with one station and we need to run a
01:47:11.719 megawatt of power and they needed 2.5
01:47:13.719 megawatts of power as you go to this
01:47:16.199 scale a megawatt of power megawatt of
01:47:18.440 Transformer cost would cost you a crow
01:47:19.840 of rupees so you have to think
01:47:21.800 holistically then you need parking for
01:47:23.960 all these buses so I mean when you have
01:47:26.199 when you have a huge place today to
01:47:27.880 scale and you have 5,000 Vehicles
01:47:29.320 tomorrow 50,000 Vehicles you to park
01:47:31.239 50,000 Vehicles what is the real estate
01:47:33.719 cost of 50,000 Vehicles versus you come
01:47:36.360 in you swap in each of our stations for
01:47:39.280 the two wheelers today do do 200 swaps a
01:47:43.560 day so we have 600 stations so on a
01:47:46.040 daily base I can get it to 120,000
01:47:49.119 scooters right that's the kind of
01:47:50.920 throughput we have so the scale you're
01:47:53.360 able to do to add a million vehicles in
01:47:55.520 a country and 5 million Vehicles your
01:47:58.280 infrastructure the energy cost the the
01:48:01.520 real estate cost the solutioning around
01:48:04.599 the whole thing has to come Together Al
01:48:06.080 it kills a bit of range anxiety doesn't
01:48:08.080 it we find that tremendously we find
01:48:10.880 that at least that when someone knows
01:48:12.599 that 2 kilometers away there's something
01:48:15.800 they use more of the battery you know
01:48:18.040 they also gun it and you said eventually
01:48:20.880 the differentiation is going to be brand
01:48:24.119 like it is for ic's every business ever
01:48:27.280 it's not range it's not this it's not
01:48:30.560 that so I just have a quick question are
01:48:33.400 you saying tier one tier two tier three
01:48:35.840 everywhere in India the same rules apply
01:48:39.320 range anxiet haven't seen a difference
01:48:41.280 so I'll give you usage data right we we
01:48:43.800 now sell across 100 cities so it's
01:48:45.480 reasonable T1 ti2 T3 distribution uh
01:48:47.920 users are across all three towns equal
01:48:51.679 numbers I think tier one uh daily usage
01:48:56.080 is 31 km tier 2 is like 32 tier 3 is
01:49:00.159 like 29 there is no meaningful
01:49:02.239 difference of usage daily usage there is
01:49:04.920 no meaningful difference of buying
01:49:06.400 patterns tier one tier 2 tier three
01:49:08.639 that's surprising you're saying people
01:49:09.840 in are buying confus the same percentage
01:49:12.520 as tier one it is very confusing
01:49:14.560 everybody's buying in the same
01:49:15.880 proportion of the premium and the entry
01:49:17.760 level why why is that I think because
01:49:20.520 everybody's generally misjudged our
01:49:22.480 economy India's always been Supply
01:49:24.520 constraint not demand constraint like in
01:49:26.360 two wheelers also my biggest belief has
01:49:28.960 been since we started ather that
01:49:30.719 everybody's misjudging the market by
01:49:32.599 trying to build a like trying to build a
01:49:35.639 cheaper and a cheaper and a cheaper and
01:49:37.080 a cheaper two wheer for a long
01:49:39.239 time I bought an a rather my friend
01:49:42.480 bought a Honda Activa when I was in 10th
01:49:44.199 standard when it just came about first
01:49:45.880 activas came about in the country it was
01:49:47.800 I think about 45,000 rupes back back
01:49:50.360 then H that's
01:49:53.679 2005 to
01:49:55.960 2015 when we had started a actually for
01:49:59.159 2020 15 years later the damn product was
01:50:02.080 still only
01:50:02.960 75,000 it didn't grow with inflation at
01:50:06.560 alling four times
01:50:11.560 9,000 but
01:50:13.760 uh the consumer has moved like lot of
01:50:17.599 steps ahead in life that same customer
01:50:20.199 goes to the market he's like if I'm
01:50:21.639 buying a bike huh I'll spend 1.6 lakhs
01:50:24.040 if I'm buying a scooter he's only
01:50:25.199 spending 90k why it's not
01:50:30.840 like I I'd always believed this we kind
01:50:34.760 of hedged our bet launching multiple
01:50:36.360 variants but every damn time we've been
01:50:38.199 surprised before I finish with ch then
01:50:41.119 for our crowd for an entrepreneur Young
01:50:44.320 starting off what is the opportunity in
01:50:46.440 battery like battery swapping what can
01:50:48.960 somebody build
01:50:51.599 so
01:50:53.440 um the see the market is very large
01:50:56.840 right and uh there's also an existing
01:50:59.679 Market of
01:51:01.239 eras there's around 2 million
01:51:04.520 eras which in battery swapping on energy
01:51:07.840 businesses around a billion dollars a
01:51:09.520 year right they're all in smaller cities
01:51:13.000 and uh um so you've had a lot of um
01:51:16.400 smaller startups creating solutions for
01:51:19.360 retrofit kits for these um for these ER
01:51:22.520 shars because they use Le acid batteries
01:51:24.199 and after 9 months these batteries die
01:51:26.639 and they have to replace it which cost
01:51:28.159 from 35,000 to 40,000 rupees so you can
01:51:31.280 at that point get into a subscription
01:51:33.119 model and they're able to then also use
01:51:36.159 it in you know they do it during the day
01:51:38.320 they'll give it to their nephew or
01:51:39.480 someone in the evening for three hours
01:51:41.320 so they can use it when in of char and
01:51:43.119 let asses take 56 hours to charge unlike
01:51:45.079 lithium ions right because they don't
01:51:46.400 have that so clearly that's and there
01:51:48.960 opportunity and because
01:51:50.480 because um it's going to be different
01:51:53.280 India is such a big Market it's going to
01:51:55.239 be difficult to be in every Market in
01:51:57.119 every place there are going to be
01:51:58.719 opportunities for micro entrepreneurs um
01:52:01.480 to look at such options uh you would
01:52:03.719 suest set up charging stations or
01:52:06.159 battery swapping St so they can be there
01:52:08.000 in the business of battery swapping
01:52:09.440 right in the battery side of it I think
01:52:11.840 there's also you know we're doing
01:52:14.159 franchises so and so there could be a
01:52:16.480 franchise who takes a station and they
01:52:18.920 get a certain work financially how much
01:52:21.159 money would I need to put up to be a
01:52:22.840 franchisee what is it called your B
01:52:25.400 foring company the sun Mobility right so
01:52:28.480 if you're looking at a smaller station
01:52:30.239 that's that'll be around uh well that'll
01:52:32.599 be launched in a couple of months it be
01:52:33.760 a lck and a half as a franchise fee and
01:52:36.280 Kix um that's would be a franchise so
01:52:38.639 that's what you'd give as as a deposit
01:52:40.440 and then you get a certain Revenue share
01:52:43.560 and then um U you know tomorrow don't
01:52:45.440 you have to spend to set it up this the
01:52:47.560 store or the smaller one they can set it
01:52:49.520 up just just sent you on Wheels and it
01:52:51.159 gets all online right the larger
01:52:53.199 stations need a little bit more uh the
01:52:54.880 investment is around 5 lakhs for that
01:52:56.560 area again this is not including real
01:52:58.280 estate and all of that no so someone
01:53:00.000 already has a shop next to that they put
01:53:01.719 this and then they have extra business
01:53:03.320 right and then they also have secondary
01:53:04.719 businesses you may be atire shop and he
01:53:06.560 does this um or he may be having other
01:53:10.280 Goods to sell so not only has a revenue
01:53:11.960 from this but he also creates that so I
01:53:14.239 mean all our dealers have that right so
01:53:15.960 if you think about uh oem's dealers have
01:53:19.440 this if you think about it five years
01:53:20.960 from today they're not going to have
01:53:22.159 revenue on Service as much because the
01:53:24.679 service of electric vehicles as much
01:53:26.320 less there no oil changes and all the
01:53:28.040 stuff how will they make Revenue an
01:53:30.040 ongoing basis so by giving them a
01:53:32.000 franchise model they are able to make
01:53:34.520 Revenue not only that typically a
01:53:37.280 station may see 50 customers a day so
01:53:39.800 those 50 customers that are coming you
01:53:41.440 can cross sell them you can say hey oh
01:53:43.079 your vehicle needs service and how much
01:53:44.520 do you mark up the electricity your cost
01:53:46.800 to the recharging thing as franch don't
01:53:49.960 think it's to think of it as a markup
01:53:52.320 what you're doing is you're doing you're
01:53:53.880 taking your battery and you're
01:53:55.119 amortizing it right and then you're
01:53:58.119 adding the charging infrastructure and
01:53:59.560 amortizing it and then the energy and
01:54:01.360 amortizing it but let's take a scooter a
01:54:05.520 petol scooter would probably cost you
01:54:07.119 around 2 rupees 2 rupes 20 PES per
01:54:09.800 kilometer right a soft scooter May cost
01:54:12.880 you between 1 rupee to 1e 20 by
01:54:15.679 kilometer right and the cost of scooter
01:54:18.079 would be cheaper than a petrol scooter
01:54:19.280 I'm just giving you an idea of what that
01:54:20.920 would mean on this front
01:54:22.560 here so if I were to put up one lakh
01:54:25.119 rupee and set up Sun Mobility battery
01:54:27.920 swapping next to my store probably get
01:54:30.440 an between an 18 to 22% return minimum
01:54:33.560 even today even today yes at the
01:54:37.040 frequency of people using battery
01:54:39.480 swapping today yeah right and they could
01:54:41.239 be higher in the years to come as you
01:54:43.440 start to look at it so lastly
01:54:47.400 tarun so tarun is a broke
01:54:50.320 and we hang out we recently SP I've been
01:54:53.840 dragged into the hanging out yeah so I
01:54:57.400 know his personal life a bit more than
01:55:00.000 others also I have researched tarun's
01:55:03.280 company ather a fair amount uh maybe tun
01:55:06.320 can start telling us a bit about himself
01:55:09.159 from the
01:55:10.239 beginning for everyone else listening
01:55:12.960 I'm
01:55:13.840 Mar can't speak though uh but BN B inad
01:55:19.360 but can't speak guu either uh one of
01:55:22.040 those guys who had to go to science
01:55:23.440 because marks
01:55:25.440 science and uh that science somebody
01:55:29.159 suggested you should write J so went for
01:55:31.760 coaching clear J luckily
01:55:35.119 um got a seat in I Madras so went there
01:55:38.400 did a 5-year course there graduated in
01:55:41.119 2012 and we started a an year later in
01:55:44.960 2030 uh our love I was trying to say
01:55:48.520 even in the start at some some point was
01:55:50.679 actually uh our love actually was the
01:55:53.679 energy industry from like a very long
01:55:56.920 time me and my co-founders have been
01:55:59.119 calling ourselves a energy since many
01:56:01.000 many
01:56:02.520 years uh so we really always wanted to
01:56:04.960 start an energy company uh which is why
01:56:07.800 we called ourselves ather energy and not
01:56:09.599 ather Motors thanks and to this date we
01:56:12.000 keep hoping that this becomes an energy
01:56:14.040 company before we die explain how energy
01:56:16.719 company it's not but it's not
01:56:18.840 technically an energy
01:56:20.040 become how I don't
01:56:22.639 know but life is in some ways very short
01:56:25.599 and some ways long enough so I kind of
01:56:28.159 think uh 10 to 20 years to build the two
01:56:29.960 wheer business and then another 20 30
01:56:31.719 years to build the other stuff do you
01:56:33.800 think at some point with
01:56:35.679 scale it would make sense for you guys
01:56:38.800 if you own the charging infrastructure
01:56:41.280 to also generate your own electricity
01:56:43.119 maybe using solar so actually that's the
01:56:45.119 plan the energy cycle is basically
01:56:47.400 generation distribution storage and then
01:56:49.199 app apption in college we spend many
01:56:51.880 years trying to work on generation we
01:56:55.199 tried to build engines uh very very high
01:56:57.560 efficiency engines uh we succeeded
01:57:00.480 technically not commercially though so
01:57:04.119 and later on the idea that we had was to
01:57:05.679 build battery packs which is storage and
01:57:08.199 you wanted to build a swapping
01:57:10.079 Network which is distribution so we
01:57:13.280 justifi to ourselves by saying
01:57:15.639 energy distribtion this is energy the
01:57:18.800 distribution storage company and later
01:57:21.639 we built we we were building a scooter
01:57:23.639 on the side to put that battery pack on
01:57:26.920 and we fell in love with a scooter so we
01:57:29.920 became a vehicle company but I kind of
01:57:31.840 still think like we do run a fairly
01:57:33.159 large fast charging Network actually in
01:57:34.880 two wheelers it's the largest fast
01:57:36.000 charging Network in the country we how
01:57:38.159 is that because your competition
01:57:41.920 has incumbent distribution through
01:57:44.480 service centers right like if you take
01:57:46.040 they don't have charging there no but I
01:57:48.520 would assume it's easy for a
01:57:50.320 TVs or a baj or a hero to add a charging
01:57:55.400 infra to existing distribution so the
01:57:59.079 problem is not technology the problem is
01:58:00.719 what business are you in um and it's
01:58:03.119 just a it's just how you the lens that
01:58:04.880 you apply if you believe that you are a
01:58:07.239 vehicle company as defined by the
01:58:09.119 definition of we put together a vehicle
01:58:11.400 and we sell the vehicle then getting
01:58:13.440 into the business of charging unless
01:58:14.800 forced to seems kind of odd it's like
01:58:18.880 are
01:58:22.719 our customers captive customers but you
01:58:24.560 don't right because you kind of
01:58:25.760 understand that that's not our
01:58:28.079 business so they don't get into charging
01:58:30.119 unless they will really be forced to we
01:58:32.159 just think differently we actually see
01:58:33.719 this like as as was saying
01:58:35.520 synergistically listen
01:58:40.239 like enough charg if you fast charge
01:58:43.400 there then we'll need storage there that
01:58:46.199 will supply the power to fast charge
01:58:47.800 these batteries eventually you you set
01:58:49.520 up like 20 stations charging that
01:58:51.360 becomes like a micro grid then you got
01:58:53.159 decentralized power generation
01:58:54.520 distribution
01:58:55.679 storage so it's you know classical
01:58:58.639 economic theory like Adam Smith or the
01:59:01.800 Austrian theory of
01:59:03.840 Economics take the example of a needle
01:59:07.239 when somebody tries to make a needle
01:59:09.199 from start to scratch is likely less
01:59:12.840 efficient than somebody who's mining the
01:59:15.239 metal required for the needle somebody
01:59:17.199 else having another expertise so why is
01:59:20.840 why are both of you in
01:59:22.719 particular when it comes to your
01:59:24.599 particular companies trying to do
01:59:27.000 everything from start to finish no not
01:59:30.119 everything there is a
01:59:32.599 business okay so there is a business so
01:59:35.440 it would be pretty weird if I said we
01:59:37.159 should build our own tires you're not in
01:59:39.079 the business of building tires right so
01:59:41.719 if I said my business is building
01:59:43.079 Vehicles then thinking charging thinking
01:59:46.040 batteries is kind of not sensible unless
01:59:49.000 you're forc to but if I think I'm in the
01:59:51.480 business of selling you energy
01:59:55.040 as uh as he it really is then the the
02:00:00.560 the lens changes and then and then a few
02:00:02.400 things start making sense but if you're
02:00:03.719 not in the business of selling energy
02:00:05.520 today h why you thinking on these lines
02:00:07.920 so that's a dream I think some of the
02:00:10.400 things that most of the stuff that we do
02:00:11.880 today including setting up charging
02:00:13.000 stations is really in the service of the
02:00:15.440 vehicle that we have to sell are these
02:00:17.480 brand agnostic can anybody go to your
02:00:19.199 charging St our charging stations a lot
02:00:21.199 of people can now go because our St our
02:00:23.360 St our charging standard has become the
02:00:25.320 National Standard so if I have a Ola
02:00:27.520 scoter I can go to a because Ola hasn't
02:00:29.239 adopted our standard yet right but hooa
02:00:31.239 has matter has actually bunch of E2
02:00:33.880 wheer companies and startups and
02:00:35.760 charging Point operators have also
02:00:37.400 because hero is your investor as well
02:00:38.800 he's an investor right so that gives us
02:00:40.119 an advantage there right but it also
02:00:41.880 brings the largest two wheeler guy on a
02:00:43.239 on the standard platform so the company
02:00:45.760 starts thinking this way how can we get
02:00:47.719 more people to adopt a standard
02:00:49.920 you won't think like that if you a two
02:00:51.480 wheer company if I think like a two
02:00:53.000 company but if I think like I'm
02:00:54.239 ultimately like 50 years out I'm the
02:00:56.000 business of getting you lowc cost energy
02:00:58.599 then I'm thinking a little differently
02:00:59.840 longterm medition are a little different
02:01:01.960 so market shares today is say 30A 20 TVs
02:01:07.000 15 ather 12 12 ather yeah 78 baj B is
02:01:12.480 also at 12:30 now B has picked up of
02:01:15.920 yeah they've got enough distribution
02:01:16.840 today right so they can turn on the
02:01:17.880 distribution sub
02:01:20.119 open so with
02:01:23.760 distribution these guys are able to
02:01:25.719 achieve scale faster than a Ola or ather
02:01:27.719 might be shortterm
02:01:30.079 absolutely but why not long-term
02:01:33.079 long-term distribution is not really a
02:01:36.119 mo in India is not really distribute
02:01:38.639 that was the 80s India when msme was a
02:01:42.079 difficult thing so if you could get
02:01:43.719 enough entrepreneurs to sell your
02:01:45.119 vehicle you have actually a mod but
02:01:48.360 today
02:01:49.760 MSM interest in setting up E2 wheer
02:01:52.239 distribution is crazy like we have I
02:01:55.159 think this is 6 months 6 months ago we
02:01:57.360 had I think 20 or 30,000 dealer
02:01:59.679 applications for a business case that
02:02:01.560 requires you to put 2 cres up front now
02:02:03.800 there a lot of people who can do this
02:02:05.079 there are like 10,000 companies who run
02:02:07.440 Automotive dealerships in India all
02:02:09.520 scared to Hell electric otherwise we
02:02:12.679 have no future right so what are the
02:02:14.639 best eer companies or electric car
02:02:16.639 companies distribution you already
02:02:19.280 coming in an investment mindset I want
02:02:20.679 to invest and learn this for the next 5
02:02:22.159 years so you can scale up so for example
02:02:25.280 we will go
02:02:26.440 from uh we've gone from like 0 to 150 0
02:02:29.920 to 200 touch points in like 2 and a half
02:02:31.360 years we'll go from 200 touch points to
02:02:33.239 1,000 touch points in the next 2 and a
02:02:34.560 half years at which point you've crossed
02:02:36.480 oil and field scale already what took
02:02:38.440 them possibly 30 years so distribution
02:02:40.440 is a very weak Mo now in India so it's a
02:02:42.520 low hanging Advantage for incumbents
02:02:45.000 because they can turn on the tab faster
02:02:46.639 maybe an year ahead of us but it's that
02:02:49.880 after that it's a lot of other things I
02:02:51.880 think I keep coming back see here I have
02:02:54.440 like a personal interest right
02:02:56.480 especially in your space more so than
02:02:58.280 yours cuz it's uh more compet more
02:03:02.040 competitive in the public domain what is
02:03:05.400 happening to ather what is happening to
02:03:06.920 Ola because there are two very similar
02:03:09.280 companies trying to build a similar
02:03:10.920 product what do you think ather is doing
02:03:14.280 well where Ola isn't and what do you
02:03:17.079 think Ola is doing well where ather
02:03:19.639 isn't what all is doing well and what we
02:03:22.079 are not is uh getting the message out
02:03:25.320 marketing the marketing is damn good
02:03:27.040 compared to us um they've been able to
02:03:30.199 crack they've been able to ensure that a
02:03:32.239 lot of people have heard about them and
02:03:34.280 the fact that they have a two- wheeler
02:03:36.560 uh every brand track every marketing
02:03:38.320 research that we do the biggest problem
02:03:40.239 that we discover is that people don't
02:03:41.679 even know what is ather like up north
02:03:44.400 the biggest feedback that I get is that
02:03:46.480 most people think that if they heard of
02:03:48.920 of ather European nor
02:03:53.199 norian what does ather mean it's a Greek
02:03:56.159 word meaning a cleanest form of
02:04:00.119 air so ather energy was meant to be
02:04:02.320 cleanest form of energy what is the
02:04:03.559 difference between a cell and a battery
02:04:06.280 and when we said batteries all of these
02:04:08.320 times and in the Indian context what
02:04:10.400 does it actually mean do you want to
02:04:12.199 take that sure so um we see battery as a
02:04:15.920 battery pack which is looking at cell
02:04:19.760 then you integrate thermal management
02:04:21.559 the mechanical you put all the sensors
02:04:23.639 the electronics and then your you know
02:04:26.880 closing it up and making it a pack right
02:04:29.760 um there's a lot of hardware and
02:04:31.000 software and other stuff that goes
02:04:32.719 that's customized for the application
02:04:34.400 it's designed for and the temperature as
02:04:37.119 well and the temperature and then the
02:04:38.520 thermal management is very important the
02:04:40.159 new regulation coming in um there are a
02:04:42.360 lot of new safety regulations that have
02:04:44.719 come in that are quite stringent um that
02:04:47.440 require a lot of of innovative designs
02:04:50.840 uh to manage thermal on the side for
02:04:53.280 safety as well as to enhance your life
02:04:55.320 on this front is anybody making sales in
02:04:57.920 India are we able to compete with China
02:05:00.920 making sales is a commodity it's not a
02:05:03.559 technology business it's a it's setting
02:05:06.559 up any any commodity manufacturing
02:05:09.760 today the the challenge of setting up S
02:05:12.559 Manufacturing in India for a while now
02:05:14.440 has been demanding year and the minimum
02:05:17.199 investment required is pretty high like
02:05:18.800 if you're not putting if you're not
02:05:19.880 bringing 4 5,000 cres to the table
02:05:22.840 practically it'll be very difficult for
02:05:25.079 your plant to have the size and you're
02:05:27.920 purchasing to have the size to really
02:05:29.719 make this make any sense forget
02:05:31.679 competing with the LGs and Samsungs of
02:05:33.079 the world um but other problem has been
02:05:36.079 demanding you know like even if you set
02:05:37.440 up a 5,000 plant the the production out
02:05:39.840 of it has to be sold to somebody that's
02:05:41.280 only happened now is attempting Ola is
02:05:44.079 attempting building the cells why is
02:05:45.880 that the logic there is that vertical
02:05:49.040 integration will help reduce cost
02:05:51.159 further but will that take their cost
02:05:53.520 below Chinese import I'll give you one
02:05:55.320 data point most cell manufacturing
02:05:58.199 companies the really enormous ones right
02:06:00.599 like lgk Panasonic all these guys even
02:06:03.840 in the best times that they made Sals
02:06:06.040 and sold Sals and like crazy ability to
02:06:08.800 sell price at any
02:06:10.360 point right last year basically their
02:06:13.800 Pats have generally not crossed into
02:06:16.159 double digits they've been generally
02:06:18.079 like four five % 6% bad
02:06:20.719 businesses um and they're very high
02:06:22.880 technology businesses so I've considered
02:06:24.679 self manufacturing as this really
02:06:26.280 complexly bad combo very high-tech with
02:06:29.719 commodity
02:06:30.760 margins so it only makes strategic sense
02:06:33.599 it generally doesn't make cost sense I'm
02:06:35.280 trying to understand as a lay man
02:06:37.280 correct the chemistry of a
02:06:39.920 cell but maybe we start from the very
02:06:42.760 simple fact of cell battery what is it
02:06:47.480 what is involved I don't know who wants
02:06:49.320 to take it go ahead see very simple lay
02:06:52.559 man like think I'm an I am an idiot but
02:06:55.119 look at me and explain it to me not to
02:06:57.000 you guys you then you should take a stab
02:06:59.719 at it you'll explain you'll explain
02:07:01.800 better than most of us on the table any
02:07:03.360 of us on the
02:07:04.679 table um so uh a cell has an anode right
02:07:09.840 and a cathode right and like a separator
02:07:13.040 that separates the two so they don't
02:07:14.559 short and then you put an electrolyte in
02:07:16.719 it and then you put that into a in a
02:07:18.599 container then put the electrolyte in it
02:07:20.480 and that's what forms think of your your
02:07:23.480 typical ablea cell or anything that you
02:07:25.480 have right and cylindrical cells are
02:07:27.920 very common they just a little larger
02:07:29.520 size something closer to probably a
02:07:32.239 something between a c-size battery
02:07:34.119 approximately that it's called a 20 26
02:07:37.000 size diameter and U you know a 750 in
02:07:40.040 length so this would be uh probably a
02:07:42.599 standard way of how you look at a cell
02:07:44.440 right and it's literally filled with
02:07:46.840 it's called a Jelly can jelly roll it's
02:07:48.760 literally filled with jelly that's the
02:07:50.679 electrolyte layer so lithium and Cobalt
02:07:52.960 does not come in at the cell level it
02:07:54.639 comes in when you're back no no no it's
02:07:56.199 at the cell right so your your your
02:07:59.159 cathod has your has your it has an nmc
02:08:02.800 which is nickel manganese Cobalt it
02:08:05.920 could be NCA right uh on this front
02:08:09.199 which is what say some companies do and
02:08:11.719 then the and then you have lfp which is
02:08:14.040 lithium manganese phosphate so there are
02:08:16.599 different chemistries and even in here
02:08:18.719 lithium ion battery what what does it
02:08:20.679 mean so it could be all of them so
02:08:22.760 lithium ion would be anything that is a
02:08:25.440 lithium battery so what is the role of
02:08:27.159 lithium in a Cell it is one of the
02:08:29.440 materials that's you I mean if you if
02:08:31.679 you think of if you think of a cell to
02:08:34.679 create a potential difference right you
02:08:37.079 try and get two materials and if you
02:08:39.000 remember the periodic table at an end
02:08:41.320 where you can get a big difference
02:08:43.199 lithium happens to be in an area where
02:08:45.559 the potential difference between that
02:08:47.800 and the energy can keep is very high
02:08:50.159 compared to say lead or so lead
02:08:52.719 aluminium aluminium a lead acid
02:08:54.840 batteries right your standard batteries
02:08:56.880 they all have different nickel Zink each
02:08:59.239 one has it you're taking two materials
02:09:01.760 that have a differential in the periodic
02:09:03.320 table and you're using that to look at
02:09:05.040 it right so that's the more you store
02:09:07.719 more energy in a battery if it can it
02:09:10.520 can like lithium because the difference
02:09:12.840 in the table I know nothing about
02:09:14.880 science but when you say differential
02:09:16.480 what do you mean well think of it that
02:09:19.119 if you if you had water and you try to
02:09:22.920 put water from one feet or 3 feet right
02:09:25.639 so think of it from 3 feet you'd get a
02:09:27.320 lot more versus from one foot right so
02:09:29.599 that would be the potential difference
02:09:31.079 you could have in in that would be the
02:09:34.440 equivalent of saying I have two
02:09:36.400 materials right and if the potential is
02:09:39.480 higher right when you're saying
02:09:41.599 potential I'm not my mind is not able to
02:09:43.760 picture potential of
02:09:45.520 what so the the potential would be be in
02:09:49.480 this case let's simplify it would be
02:09:50.920 voltage right so if I have a bigger
02:09:53.920 difference between two points the
02:09:56.079 voltage would be bigger and that's
02:09:57.520 equivalent for me you know pouring water
02:10:01.360 from a foot or 3 feet right so if I
02:10:03.719 pouring it from 3 ft are you talking
02:10:05.559 about the material's ability to pass
02:10:08.400 voltage through it no that's resistance
02:10:11.520 huh so so when you're saying potential
02:10:14.000 potential of
02:10:15.480 storing electrons or what it is a
02:10:18.320 potential is basically the difference
02:10:20.360 between the cathode and the anode right
02:10:22.880 so if you got a bigger difference
02:10:24.920 electrical difference between them then
02:10:27.599 you can
02:10:28.880 generate with all things being equal a
02:10:31.159 higher amount of current okay so current
02:10:33.719 think of that as the speed of the water
02:10:35.639 right that's it so the higher up you go
02:10:39.040 in the building the faster the water
02:10:40.880 will drop right when it comes to the
02:10:42.840 ground if you drop it from as he said
02:10:45.000 like stable height so you're saying if
02:10:46.559 the battery is bigger no it's not the
02:10:48.559 length it is it is the uh electrical
02:10:51.760 difference it is basically the periodic
02:10:53.440 table what he's talking
02:10:55.079 about the difference comes in so lead
02:10:58.040 will generate lesser potential and
02:10:59.719 lithium will I think generate higher
02:11:01.280 potential if you take the standard cell
02:11:02.719 that you get for your remote control it
02:11:05.480 has a 1.5 volts that's zinc right right
02:11:08.400 right so so zinc carbon or whatever
02:11:11.239 right then you look at lead acid right
02:11:13.679 it will be around two volts then you
02:11:15.679 look at lithium ion phosphate it'll be
02:11:17.719 around 3.2 volts and you look at lithium
02:11:21.040 ion on nmc chemistry on 3.6 volts so now
02:11:24.360 if you think that I can have three times
02:11:27.559 or 2.5 times the potential voltage which
02:11:31.199 means the amount of energy I can get is
02:11:33.119 much more because energy is current
02:11:35.119 current times of voltage so if I have
02:11:36.920 two times more voltage or two and a half
02:11:39.119 times More Voltage then I can give you a
02:11:41.239 lot more energy so is this where lithium
02:11:43.639 and Cobalt is used Cobalt is um see
02:11:47.639 basically you you dope these things the
02:11:49.719 the voltage difference is no is not
02:11:51.599 because of cobalt you can have Cobalt or
02:11:53.639 low Cobalt chemistries and the voltage
02:11:55.520 will be very similar uh Cobalt
02:11:57.960 determines the energy content uh and the
02:12:01.840 res I think the resistance is different
02:12:03.280 because of the Cobalt that use what are
02:12:04.679 the ions actually going across the anode
02:12:07.159 and the C is it actually the lithium is
02:12:10.079 it lithium ions which you're moving yeah
02:12:12.599 so it's so surprisingly somehow I feel
02:12:16.040 like I should know this but I don't so
02:12:17.559 does who's the the PHD and yet so is is
02:12:22.000 lithium like a
02:12:23.599 consumable so what happens at the end of
02:12:26.159 you charge it back it goes back right so
02:12:27.960 at this point so over timei is not the
02:12:30.239 lithium is not consumed a cell loses
02:12:32.159 life because its resistance keeps
02:12:34.239 increasing so what happens is the
02:12:37.440 medium the medium through which
02:12:39.520 electrons are traveling no that just
02:12:41.559 keeps getting for lack of a better
02:12:43.960 better word just worse and worse just
02:12:45.599 more more uh the
02:12:48.960 over time there's deterioration don't
02:12:51.159 flow well there's deterioration with
02:12:52.920 what's called lithium plating so also if
02:12:55.159 it goes the voltage goes very low that
02:12:56.840 the lithium gets actually deposited
02:12:59.360 uhhuh and that prevents electrons from
02:13:01.960 going through right because now it's
02:13:03.400 become a layer so that's how the cells
02:13:05.320 would one of the ways the cells would
02:13:06.760 deteriorate is that they actually uh the
02:13:09.800 it starts over over time a little bit of
02:13:11.800 fit from the aquous solution and and
02:13:14.840 electrolyte will actually start to get
02:13:16.280 deposited right and that starts to over
02:13:18.400 time deteri why is it called lithium ion
02:13:20.880 battery because the lithium ions are
02:13:22.360 sort of lium they are still the on
02:13:24.800 they're not getting consumed right like
02:13:25.880 the staying inside the cell because
02:13:27.440 you're able to reverse the charges
02:13:28.960 correct obviously okay so we understood
02:13:31.000 broadly what a cell is now when people
02:13:34.480 say like I was talking to that log n a
02:13:36.719 bunch of battery companies which I
02:13:38.920 realized later are not making cells
02:13:41.840 predominantly packaging cells into
02:13:43.639 making them
02:13:44.840 batteries how does one battery company
02:13:49.360 compared to another why is one better
02:13:51.280 another worse what what goes into the
02:13:53.719 process of packaging cells into a
02:13:55.320 battery you mean in battery
02:13:56.960 manufacturing battery would you call it
02:13:59.119 manufacturing P manufacturing P desp
02:14:02.280 manfa right n packing can mean something
02:14:05.639 else packing could happen with a built
02:14:07.639 battery pack also technically so battery
02:14:10.079 pack assembly is the right description
02:14:12.400 for it you can have an ridiculously high
02:14:16.000 amount of difference between companies
02:14:18.719 building battery packs using the same
02:14:20.320 cells who all are doing it in India and
02:14:22.400 what are they doing differently mostly
02:14:23.920 it's oems doing for their own internal
02:14:25.760 purposes explain OEM Em are basically
02:14:28.079 vehicle manufacturing companies right
02:14:29.880 original equipment manufacturers yeah so
02:14:32.119 all of us build our own battery packs
02:14:33.400 typically like all the key oems in India
02:14:35.280 now build their own battery
02:14:36.599 P we build our battery packs we don't
02:14:39.800 build batteries we build our battery
02:14:41.719 packs and we definitely don't build
02:14:43.159 sales today obviously companies like
02:14:45.000 Chans who are building battery packs
02:14:46.559 because it's it's a slightly different
02:14:48.840 business um but the differences come
02:14:51.800 from three possible layers and I think
02:14:53.719 it did talk about it one is basically
02:14:56.719 the thermal management thermal
02:14:58.440 management is actually in my opinion
02:14:59.679 possibly the biggest single
02:15:01.239 differentiation between all Quality
02:15:02.960 Companies there is actually a level
02:15:04.960 below that just the quality of
02:15:08.599 assembly you can just assemble you can
02:15:10.920 just weld the cells wrongly is that only
02:15:13.639 because we are more tropical in nature
02:15:15.239 than China what is thermal management is
02:15:18.000 it because before let me just describe
02:15:20.800 how actually painfully complex battery
02:15:22.880 pack manufacturing is assembly is in a
02:15:26.159 typical forget the cars cars have too
02:15:27.880 many like even in a scooter right in our
02:15:30.880 typical scooter you will have about
02:15:32.679 let's say 200 cells you will have
02:15:35.320 roughly about 800 WS 800 WS that will
02:15:38.920 happen for these 200 Cells Two WS on
02:15:41.119 each
02:15:42.559 sides if any of those WS is is wrong
02:15:46.840 that mean that's that cell that
02:15:49.079 particular cell will lose life very
02:15:51.719 quickly like literally it could lose
02:15:53.320 life within a few weeks right uh maybe
02:15:58.040 sometimes months but usually within a
02:15:59.040 few weeks the pack can go off so you've
02:16:01.079 got to get all your 800 WS correctly
02:16:03.920 okay getting 800 WS
02:16:06.639 correctly for most companies implies a
02:16:09.360 higher level of manufacturing Excellence
02:16:12.159 than the famous Six Sigma Six Sigma is
02:16:14.960 three failures per million yeah you do
02:16:18.040 three failures per million WS that means
02:16:21.079 I think one in, or one in 2,000 battery
02:16:23.920 packs are guaranteed to fail which is a
02:16:25.760 pretty crazy number for a pack
02:16:27.159 manufacturing for for like a OEM because
02:16:30.440 the risk of a pack failing in the field
02:16:31.920 is just crazy high so it is a damn hard
02:16:34.760 job just to get the welding right how
02:16:36.718 much of your resources are going into
02:16:39.519 building battery packs out of sales
02:16:42.240 between battery team battery BMS and
02:16:46.638 Manufacturing engineering
02:16:48.359 uh my guess is that's somewhere in the
02:16:50.280 range of 60 to 100 people about 100
02:16:53.040 people possibly and who who all are
02:16:55.040 doing it well in India battery pack
02:16:57.280 assembly building I think most oems like
02:17:00.799 let's say us TVs Bajaj
02:17:05.080 Ola uh Tata is that the big
02:17:07.959 differentiation that everybody's
02:17:09.200 fighting over so I think all all famous
02:17:12.879 auto companies that you know of right
02:17:14.160 now they all building reasonable okay
02:17:16.000 packs but between us also you will see
02:17:19.359 significant battery life differences
02:17:21.398 that are not going to be understood yet
02:17:23.638 so for example our oldest battery packs
02:17:26.679 are now 5 years in the field uh and we
02:17:29.519 they are still at 90% plus Health which
02:17:32.318 means we are now internally starting to
02:17:34.359 Project 8 to 10 year battery life we
02:17:37.120 know in the industry that I think most
02:17:39.120 of our competitors will also get to four
02:17:40.718 five year battery life but 8 to 10 is
02:17:43.200 going to be very difficult for most
02:17:45.080 odums it's a difference that will emerge
02:17:47.920 over the course of a decade
02:17:51.160 consumer battery pack like how Honda
02:17:53.478 engine became famous over 10 20 year
02:17:55.000 period perfect Rhythm like no sound
02:17:57.840 amazing quality but not visible in the
02:17:59.558 first year or two right so but it's a
02:18:01.959 refined difference that will not be
02:18:03.599 understood today most are building
02:18:05.359 enough sensible battery
02:18:08.879 packs so range is dependent on how many
02:18:12.200 cells are in the battery pack yeah that
02:18:15.318 determines range of the vehicle so now
02:18:18.000 coming to the thermal Val and does it
02:18:19.398 also like let's see how how much does
02:18:21.519 the ather scooter weigh about
02:18:24.558 102 to 106 kgs I think and
02:18:28.120 Battery about 18 to 20 kgs so if you add
02:18:32.080 50% more cells to your battery pack your
02:18:34.959 range will go up 50% yeah yeah possibly
02:18:37.879 even more for some efficiency reasons
02:18:41.040 minor so range is not really it's not
02:18:44.398 technology it's cost range is range is
02:18:46.359 say cost range is a product spec
02:18:50.478 decision obviously it gets Miss sold as
02:18:53.040 like you know somebody crack this
02:18:54.638 amazing battery that will do km in
02:19:00.160 Cary so range is generally not a
02:19:03.040 technology problem uh where technology
02:19:05.359 comes in are basically thermal
02:19:07.120 management is theral thermal management
02:19:09.318 what is the difference for example right
02:19:11.799 now we are the only player where we
02:19:14.318 don't put any restriction on fast
02:19:15.920 charging so we customers if you want to
02:19:18.120 fast charge practically every day be my
02:19:19.760 guest right C otherwise what is the
02:19:22.959 problem with fast charging most
02:19:24.398 companies like for example I have a hyai
02:19:26.959 they recommend I think one in 10 charges
02:19:29.638 to be a fast charge I think and I think
02:19:32.000 most companies recommend don't fast
02:19:33.879 charge if it's a very hot day don't
02:19:36.160 reduces the potential in the cells
02:19:38.318 because your cells heat up every time
02:19:39.920 you pass current through your battery
02:19:41.638 pack current flows through your cells
02:19:44.280 and the cells heat up in the process
02:19:46.200 okay now when when you turn on the
02:19:48.080 vehicle and the current has to flow
02:19:49.840 through the cells again to go to your
02:19:51.439 motor the cell again heats up in both
02:19:54.040 processes it heats up it's like think of
02:19:55.800 a pipe if you're like just basically
02:19:57.280 rubbing the pipe really fast or rubbing
02:19:58.760 the table really fast it'll heat up
02:20:00.680 that's exactly what's happening inside
02:20:02.000 this and then how do you cool down the
02:20:03.240 bike once it heats up that's THL
02:20:05.080 management so you can do it multiple
02:20:06.840 ways cars typically it's active which
02:20:09.479 means there will be a liquid which will
02:20:11.960 pass through the battery pack and will
02:20:14.120 liquid cooled air cooled like but none
02:20:16.040 of none of us in India does cooling for
02:20:17.840 two wheer crazy cost structure doesn't
02:20:19.560 make sense today so all of us do
02:20:21.680 different kind of passive cooling which
02:20:23.319 means we'll route air like V we'll route
02:20:26.760 air through around the battery pack uh
02:20:28.960 we will put very interesting materials
02:20:31.840 inside the battery pack that take the
02:20:33.600 heat out there are these materials
02:20:35.800 called face change
02:20:37.120 materials basically if the cell Heats
02:20:40.000 let's say 50°
02:20:41.359 C any temperature any heat above 50°
02:20:45.120 material and this material will
02:20:46.840 basically become a jelly as it takes the
02:20:49.000 heat out so 50 to a fair degree of
02:20:51.920 temperature it'll just keep changing its
02:20:54.200 literally it face Chang and then as it
02:20:57.399 gets time to cool down it'll again be
02:20:59.000 harden up right so you've got these
02:21:00.960 materials you got a lot of epoxy we use
02:21:03.439 a lot of aluminium everywhere like bar I
02:21:06.319 might sound really stupid asking this
02:21:07.960 but I read somewhere ke when you stop at
02:21:11.280 a traffic light
02:21:13.399 H that
02:21:15.640 breaking kinetic energy is also
02:21:18.080 converted into electrical does it happen
02:21:20.560 in regener Breaking yes how does that
02:21:22.880 that's very interesting how does that
02:21:24.520 work so the motor just becomes a
02:21:27.160 generator right so a motor you know um
02:21:31.640 run the other way actually generates
02:21:33.319 energy back so as you press a brake
02:21:35.359 pedal or you put it to neutral you can
02:21:37.800 get it back right um in cars driving you
02:21:42.800 get probably 18 to
02:21:45.280 20% um that's very high
02:21:48.520 yeah yeah I mean I'm telling you after
02:21:50.880 millions of kilometers of data from our
02:21:53.319 ve from the vehicles we had done 80 to
02:21:55.840 20% bikes um most most bikes um is that
02:22:00.319 a factor of the mass The more mass well
02:22:02.200 it's also the way you set the region up
02:22:03.720 but most bikes in India give you 6 to
02:22:05.800 10% actually I talk about what we do and
02:22:09.200 and when we've optimized we've gone up
02:22:12.040 to 18% so it again depends on the
02:22:15.880 controller the algorithm
02:22:17.680 how you integrate it um there's a lot of
02:22:20.840 work that goes behind it and you know we
02:22:23.800 over 15 years of doing that we've
02:22:25.280 optimize a lot more on that FR it's an
02:22:27.560 important piece of it right but that
02:22:29.560 also of course you think about it when
02:22:31.439 you put a lot of energy it's charging
02:22:33.760 the battery back so therefore also the
02:22:35.399 batter is heat up right The Challenge on
02:22:38.600 scooters in cities like Delhi when it's
02:22:41.720 45 ambient even the air going around it
02:22:45.080 is going to be 45 right so so um the
02:22:48.319 batteries is harder to cool down in a
02:22:50.720 midday if you're trying to fast charge
02:22:53.280 it or this right so that's one of the
02:22:55.479 concerns in the winter it's okay
02:22:57.319 climates like Bangalore it may be okay
02:22:59.520 but um with that's where active cooling
02:23:02.120 becomes more important so if we take the
02:23:04.439 battery and put in a station for example
02:23:06.160 the station's air conditioned so the
02:23:07.520 batteries come down to 25° so even if
02:23:09.280 the ambient's 45 the battery comes on to
02:23:12.000 25 so how does that affect say ather in
02:23:15.279 Delhi versus ather in Bangalore on on
02:23:17.960 ground well cells in generally at 45 to
02:23:21.000 25 degrees you could have almost half
02:23:23.640 the life that means if batteries are at
02:23:26.279 40 right so so it's very important um
02:23:30.439 that that it is so cells don't like hot
02:23:34.200 and they don't like hot and fully
02:23:35.520 charged and what happens in a cell when
02:23:37.520 it's hot so when it's hot the chemic
02:23:39.520 materal the chemicals start to
02:23:41.479 disintegrate a little bit right so at a
02:23:43.160 higher temperature like most chemicals
02:23:44.920 where as you increase the temperature
02:23:46.200 the deterioration is higher right so a
02:23:49.600 high charge rate and high temperature
02:23:52.399 has a multiplying effect because when
02:23:55.359 there's so much energy there then
02:23:56.800 there's a lot more corrosion happening
02:23:58.479 internally right so if I'm buying a
02:24:00.120 5-year-old electric scooter from Delhi
02:24:02.520 versus Bangalore I should pay half the
02:24:04.319 price for the Delhi one half the price
02:24:06.920 so so I'll tell you what what while
02:24:09.160 while all of that is correct um and
02:24:12.000 obviously sells degrade like they
02:24:13.279 literally these cracks that kind of I
02:24:15.680 forget the the technical term
02:24:19.160 literally cracks that form that increase
02:24:21.040 the resistance more the resistance
02:24:23.479 harder it is for current to travel and
02:24:25.040 your energy
02:24:26.040 drops now but what what is happening
02:24:28.720 right now is for the last five six
02:24:31.560 years um and sell manufacturers don't
02:24:34.200 like to claim this because they don't
02:24:35.640 like the liability that may potentially
02:24:37.439 come with it but most good sell
02:24:39.920 manufacturers have actually push the
02:24:41.560 life pretty high but they don't want to
02:24:44.120 basically claim it right because they
02:24:45.720 will then held responsible
02:24:48.479 so what we are realizing is in even in a
02:24:52.120 place like Delhi at the end of 5 years
02:24:55.439 Sals are still probably good at 85
02:24:58.279 87% battery packs sorry not Sals battery
02:25:00.640 packs in Bango that number might be 90
02:25:03.520 right now the difference would be if you
02:25:05.319 run the vehicle a lot right commerci
02:25:07.960 like yellow use I'm sure they will
02:25:09.880 notice there will be a battery well
02:25:12.800 active cooling might make a difference
02:25:14.359 but if you what is active cooling
02:25:15.840 basically pass the liquid
02:25:17.479 keep the keep the temperature low if you
02:25:20.240 don't do that and you run let's say if
02:25:21.960 you run even our scooter 100 km or 150
02:25:24.520 km every day let's say 30,000 km 35,000
02:25:28.160 km an year which is pretty crazy no
02:25:30.080 personal consumer ever will do it you
02:25:31.840 will notice that the scooter in
02:25:33.720 Bangalore is lasting longer than the
02:25:35.640 scooter in Delhi except that you will
02:25:37.880 likely hit like basic uski life you will
02:25:40.680 hit okay right now what's happening is
02:25:43.200 most 99% of our consumers the batteries
02:25:46.160 will literally
02:25:47.920 expire calendar aging they will just
02:25:50.359 literally expire then they will hit
02:25:52.960 usage expir so in some sense if you do
02:25:58.359 enough of a good work with Thal
02:25:59.960 management whether you are in Bangalore
02:26:01.960 whether you in Delhi whether you fast
02:26:03.359 charge every day or you fast charge once
02:26:05.120 in a week you ride with three people you
02:26:08.240 ride with a single person you ride at 90
02:26:10.319 you ride at 30 very patiently you charge
02:26:13.439 sensibly you never take take it to 100%
02:26:15.680 or you always take it to 100% all of it
02:26:17.600 is making a limited Delta
02:26:24.040 similarly so it's not making enough of a
02:26:26.200 difference now and what is this story
02:26:28.080 you often see like these
02:26:30.600 viral uh dramatic memes of lithium is in
02:26:35.640 Chile and Cobalt is in Congo and China
02:26:40.600 controls both the
02:26:43.680 man don't you see them so many memes
02:26:46.120 about Congo and Chile and talk about how
02:26:50.040 China controls all refining capacity and
02:26:52.240 we'll be dependent on them forever I
02:26:54.000 think something has been discovered in
02:26:55.120 India also now in Kashmir but they say
02:26:57.120 there's no refining capacity so even
02:26:59.040 that has to go to China it w't take more
02:27:02.000 I mean just like just like you know
02:27:04.120 there's an area where you know lithium
02:27:07.720 in a way is the next Oil right so I
02:27:11.160 think the government's also thinking
02:27:12.640 what are the Strategic Partnerships you
02:27:14.279 create like this created from an oil
02:27:15.840 energy point of view right so there's
02:27:17.600 already conversations with South
02:27:18.960 American countries Australia and stuff
02:27:20.960 to say okay let's have these
02:27:22.800 Partnerships to do it and that has to be
02:27:24.479 done if certain raw materials and
02:27:26.920 scarcity right but also what'll happen
02:27:29.160 Nickel in 10 years right um recycling
02:27:32.560 will play a very large role in a market
02:27:33.960 like India because these batteries once
02:27:36.399 you're off you know today your cell
02:27:38.840 phone batteries and everything were very
02:27:41.080 small and they were very different
02:27:42.760 formats but you know um as one of these
02:27:46.960 car batteries may be equivalent to 5,000
02:27:49.160 cell phone batteries so any recycling is
02:27:52.160 there and today recycling costs are
02:27:55.319 actually earlier you used to pay to
02:27:57.359 recycle now you can make money out of it
02:27:59.920 if anything can make money in in in a
02:28:01.920 market like India where you sell paper
02:28:03.760 Rec make money out of it how means when
02:28:06.640 you recycle it you can sell back the
02:28:09.000 more than the cost of recycling oh damn
02:28:12.680 so let me give the number for for
02:28:14.080 example just the cost of material M just
02:28:17.359 the material alone in a typical 4 Kow
02:28:19.760 battery pack is about
02:28:22.359 $240 today right about $60 a kilow this
02:28:25.920 is the raw material inside literally the
02:28:27.880 cost of material not like the assembled
02:28:29.520 processed cost of recycling the material
02:28:31.720 to get it back possibly 1,000 2,000
02:28:34.439 Rupees $10 $15 $20 yeah so if you like
02:28:39.439 like one of the places where people
02:28:41.200 should go after in India guaranteed is
02:28:44.520 recycling granted you will not get that
02:28:46.680 entire $240 yourselves because enough
02:28:49.680 people in the chain who will take that
02:28:51.880 money away from you but the Delta is so
02:28:54.000 large that even if you were make like 2
02:28:56.160 3,000 rupees in a pack it's huge and the
02:28:59.640 national policy is very is almost going
02:29:02.680 in the direction of lithium once in the
02:29:04.760 country should never exit the
02:29:10.479 country let me make sure it never like
02:29:13.120 please make sure you never have it never
02:29:14.479 leaves the country accidentally is that
02:29:16.279 a viable business I was going to come to
02:29:18.040 this question from all that you spoke
02:29:20.479 about you started this business in 20134
02:29:24.000 with a friend of yours with less
02:29:26.080 Capital if I'm a young entrepreneur
02:29:29.319 today wanting to start something here
02:29:31.800 where do you see the opportunity is it
02:29:33.720 in sell recycling is it in trying to
02:29:37.240 build I'm going to come back to the bike
02:29:39.720 itself you said 20 kilos out of 104 is
02:29:42.439 the battery then we'll go to the chassis
02:29:44.080 and the other parts but where do you see
02:29:46.240 the opportunity so I think recycling of
02:29:49.840 Sals is a very big opportunity uh I
02:29:53.040 think they're captive requirements like
02:29:54.279 for example if you came to us today and
02:29:56.160 you said hey I will run basically a
02:29:59.200 contract shop for you you give us all
02:30:01.720 your reject battery packs I'll strip
02:30:04.000 them down I'll convert into raw
02:30:05.840 materials which you can sell to your s
02:30:07.600 supplier back right it essentially fixes
02:30:11.000 my pricing
02:30:12.319 right price so I have to pay more for a
02:30:15.359 production for a month right if I have
02:30:17.840 enough sales coming back then I can just
02:30:20.359 basically remove that fluctuation out so
02:30:22.760 what do I need to start this business
02:30:24.760 there is enough Tech available you today
02:30:27.520 will probably need a JV immediately if
02:30:29.920 you want to Fast Track with with some
02:30:32.920 company in Europe or probably in China
02:30:35.240 or Korea who will have recycling Tech or
02:30:37.920 you can spend a couple of years and just
02:30:39.160 figure out companies in India who
02:30:41.279 and there are good companies in India
02:30:42.200 also sure who are doing Recycling and
02:30:43.520 are setting up shop even outside India
02:30:45.600 yeah yeah yeah so you set up uh
02:30:48.120 recycling I think it is it is it is such
02:30:51.040 a stable
02:30:54.560 business 250 million Vehicles going to
02:30:57.120 go to 350 million vehicles and annually
02:30:59.640 out of that 30 million is going to come
02:31:01.319 back and 10 15 years later a very large
02:31:03.800 chunk of that will be electric you got
02:31:05.680 almost a guaranteed business right sure
02:31:09.319 you may not make like it it's not going
02:31:10.800 to be like a 50% margin business but you
02:31:12.680 don't have to worry about demand at all
02:31:14.600 what if I want to start an electric
02:31:15.880 scooter
02:31:16.960 then you will need something disruptive
02:31:19.080 as like what do you think the next
02:31:20.760 disruptive thing there
02:31:23.399 is give away my road
02:31:26.120 map uh see so I think the market changed
02:31:29.920 from the time we started right when we
02:31:31.720 started the disruption was the spec us
02:31:36.319 saying the best electric Scot on the
02:31:38.319 market did 25 maybe 30 35 km per hour
02:31:41.560 top
02:31:42.279 speed 800 wats really mix motor this
02:31:45.560 also you didn't answer we said double
02:31:47.760 the number of cells double the number of
02:31:50.000 amount of range correct what determines
02:31:52.040 the speed of the scooter motor motor
02:31:55.720 power and the motor power is determined
02:31:58.120 by the battery size in some cases okay
02:32:01.240 so bigger the battery it can supply more
02:32:02.880 current mhm and if you want more speed
02:32:05.680 you need a bigger motor rule of thumb
02:32:08.439 you want to go from let's
02:32:11.359 say every 10% speed increase increases
02:32:14.840 the motor power by roughly about 30%
02:32:16.760 something like that roughly so you will
02:32:19.720 go faster so are these the main parts
02:32:21.560 there's a motor there's a battery pack
02:32:23.279 there's a chassis there's tires whatever
02:32:25.640 like body and then there a charger there
02:32:27.600 is a motor controller another piece of
02:32:29.319 electronics is that what determines how
02:32:31.279 much current goes into the motor yeah
02:32:32.880 motor control is quite important and
02:32:34.560 that actually a lot of the IP today for
02:32:36.640 companies sits inside the motor
02:32:38.080 controller motor itself has limited IP
02:32:40.439 these days can you break that down a
02:32:41.920 little bit explain how a motor
02:32:43.479 controller Works um to run a motor
02:32:46.840 you need some somebody to control
02:32:49.399 somebody to send signals and control the
02:32:51.840 power that it gets see motor in my mind
02:32:55.160 I'm thinking IC vehicle I'm thinking
02:32:57.319 there is a spark
02:32:58.680 plug expanding Pistons yeah but think of
02:33:01.760 it very simply you have a regulator for
02:33:03.640 your fan in your
02:33:05.160 house right for your fan you can of do
02:33:07.920 one speed two speed three speed four
02:33:09.479 speed the motor controller does that in
02:33:11.560 a very sophisticated manner in a very
02:33:14.240 sophisticated what is the uniqueness in
02:33:15.920 which
02:33:17.920 so what is the big unique like what is
02:33:20.600 the differentiation between your motor
02:33:22.319 controller and ola's motor controller
02:33:24.479 I'm just taking you guys because you're
02:33:25.880 the most popular so I don't I haven't
02:33:27.800 exactly studied the motor controller in
02:33:29.520 detail but I can give one feature
02:33:32.200 example um recently that both of us did
02:33:35.399 at the very same time but just about 10
02:33:37.560 months ago both of us implemented a
02:33:39.840 feature called Auto hold cars have Auto
02:33:42.120 hold Hill hold right so for example if
02:33:44.319 you on a slope like coming out of a mall
02:33:46.760 parking lot let's say you will engage
02:33:48.720 Auto hold which means you will never
02:33:49.920 accidentally slide back so if you put
02:33:51.800 the throttle on
02:33:55.000 throttle simple feature two wheelers
02:33:57.520 don't have it okay but electric you can
02:34:00.000 build it because you got a very
02:34:01.399 sophisticated motor controller so it can
02:34:03.200 ensure your motor only turns forward
02:34:05.319 does not accidentally go into reverse
02:34:06.680 even if there's Force coming on it and
02:34:08.319 it's a lot of sophisticated control to
02:34:09.720 ensure how to manage that load and
02:34:12.359 ensure you always move forward okay but
02:34:15.319 the way both both of us implemented
02:34:17.479 it uh pretty substantial difference like
02:34:20.560 fundamentally sounds the same feature
02:34:22.720 but the way we implemented and the way
02:34:25.080 Ola implemented uh I think ola's uh same
02:34:28.279 capability would last a much shorter
02:34:30.520 time so if you engage this hillh hold
02:34:32.960 feature on a steep slope after a minute
02:34:35.960 or so the motor would be like okay now I
02:34:38.359 can't support this it'll start rolling
02:34:39.880 back the way we implemented it you could
02:34:42.120 just stay like that for 10 minutes right
02:34:44.760 so there's something very different
02:34:45.760 about we did about how we did the
02:34:47.160 algorithms about how we managed the heat
02:34:48.920 coming out of the mot cooling the mot
02:34:51.560 mot he a lot of very different stuff we
02:34:54.680 also changed the just the experience
02:34:57.359 like you don't have to like tap this
02:34:58.960 press this button do this in fact cars
02:35:00.920 have it more complicated we said if you
02:35:03.200 press the brakes and you release them
02:35:04.680 you're automatically inh
02:35:07.560 hold right I I have to buy a scooter
02:35:11.080 okay both of you cost similar amounts
02:35:13.720 maybe 10,000 bucks here and there
02:35:15.600 actually ,000 only yeah yeah yeah so how
02:35:17.760 do I pick should I buy Ola or should I
02:35:19.520 buy ather this is a very relevant
02:35:21.120 question for everyone watching this show
02:35:22.560 which will be millions of people my
02:35:24.760 pitch is you should buy us because you
02:35:26.800 probably understand that we've what we'
02:35:28.560 have done so you know you also what have
02:35:31.439 you done before that you asked a
02:35:33.319 question at the start uh and I it's I'm
02:35:35.479 I'm doing my company Injustice if I
02:35:36.680 don't answer the second part of that
02:35:37.840 question which is you ask me what that
02:35:39.640 Ola do well and what is but I didn't
02:35:41.600 answer what is ather doing well I would
02:35:43.399 say what we are doing well is we have
02:35:44.880 better word of of
02:35:46.800 mouth so we may not have marketed the
02:35:49.120 product well so not enough people may
02:35:51.160 buy it today but the ones who are buying
02:35:53.080 it have a better word of mouth for us
02:35:55.279 than many of our competitors because
02:35:58.080 because of how the product is built it's
02:35:59.600 overall quality the overall experience
02:36:01.439 that you get why are large scooter
02:36:05.359 companies like Ola getting that P
02:36:07.720 benefit in ather is
02:36:10.000 not because PL was just written
02:36:12.520 incorrectly and after the mistake was
02:36:14.720 made everybody still struggling how do
02:36:16.880 who will correct it because correcting a
02:36:20.560 government written document is just who
02:36:23.040 wants to baild that cat right who wants
02:36:24.560 to be the guy who changed the
02:36:26.640 document so everybody super scared of
02:36:28.840 touching it though almost everybody
02:36:30.960 agrees unanimously that's a mistake so
02:36:34.040 the definition was either Revenue which
02:36:37.439 no EV company has ever made which means
02:36:39.520 only listed large Auto players who
02:36:42.120 actually have very little interest in
02:36:43.200 actually doing electric could apply for
02:36:44.560 bi or the only other way you can apply
02:36:46.840 for PL is if you actually are not
02:36:49.880 manufacturing electric
02:36:52.120 vehicles but if you are a company
02:36:54.319 manufacturing electric vehicles making
02:36:55.760 actual Investments committed 100% only
02:36:58.439 to doing doing electric you can't apply
02:37:00.800 for PL so if I start a new scooter
02:37:03.720 company today I won't get the pl no
02:37:05.680 chance and it's not even like there's a
02:37:07.520 second window and window opens up every
02:37:08.920 year that you can apply for p so it's a
02:37:12.359 pretty weird mistake that's happened and
02:37:14.600 it needs to be corrected
02:37:16.319 M but that's the thing somebody just
02:37:18.399 needs to find the courage to acknowledge
02:37:20.040 that this is a mistake and it needs
02:37:21.439 correction and it's not just us we are
02:37:24.319 probably the most permanent one in the
02:37:25.720 E2 wheer industry but as you said if you
02:37:28.800 were to start an E2 wheer company today
02:37:30.479 you're kind of screwed you can't apply
02:37:31.600 for
02:37:32.399 p um even if you say I'll invest 2,000
02:37:36.080 crores into this give me PL you still
02:37:38.720 can't okay so let's go break down the
02:37:41.640 cost of the
02:37:42.880 scooter by weight just to make it
02:37:45.479 interesting testing 104 kilos 20 battery
02:37:49.560 chassis is how much start from the
02:37:51.600 biggest weight chassis is the largest
02:37:54.080 chassis really are going by weight
02:37:55.880 Plastics go by weight tires go by weight
02:37:58.760 right a lot of those core components
02:38:00.960 which are there in any any scooter uhhuh
02:38:04.200 will go by weight and the
02:38:05.880 differentiation is your your Motors your
02:38:09.040 controllers your battery packs your
02:38:11.399 clusters your telematics right those are
02:38:14.200 areas that uh unfortunately the weight
02:38:18.040 equation is not necessarily there right
02:38:20.560 it's about I mean just take your iPhone
02:38:23.279 yeah right and I'm just saying how many
02:38:25.040 grams is that why does it cost I'm just
02:38:27.399 saying I'm just trying to get that piece
02:38:29.200 as an example here I'm not asking for
02:38:31.640 weight in the sense that he'll say 100
02:38:33.319 kilos and he'll be like
02:38:36.680 J no but are you get so cost wise
02:38:40.720 battery costs how much batteries I can't
02:38:43.600 give the exact numbers but in percentage
02:38:45.240 generally about about 35% is a good
02:38:46.920 estimate 35% of 1ak 65,000 close
02:38:51.560 enough okay
02:38:53.880 exact that's not my cost right my cost
02:38:56.240 is different I'm not BR my cost number
02:38:58.439 okay next next biggest component next
02:39:00.560 biggest component is in our case
02:39:05.000 um the motor Plus controller the not the
02:39:10.720 motor part we discussed earlier oh wait
02:39:12.920 motor and the electronic controller that
02:39:14.399 goes together yeah together how much
02:39:16.120 would this be you can take this as
02:39:19.800 another maybe
02:39:22.319 10% okay then you can take the chassis
02:39:25.080 actually shassy is the second component
02:39:26.760 chassis is I think I would say about 15%
02:39:30.120 okay so the frame and joining components
02:39:32.880 okay uh then you've got uh in our case a
02:39:37.240 touchscreen
02:39:38.240 dashboard uh so that's another 10% the
02:39:41.600 70%
02:39:42.880 then then you've got uh Charger Charger
02:39:47.520 Charger external charger and some a lot
02:39:49.319 of
02:39:50.080 peripherals another 10% MH then you can
02:39:52.840 add everything aesthetic the lights
02:39:55.279 plastic body panels all
02:39:58.240 that simplify
02:40:01.439 10% B
02:40:04.160 basic
02:40:05.720 10% basic there's a lot of other
02:40:08.600 electronics on the vehicle to run the
02:40:10.160 stuff how much are you selling the
02:40:11.560 scooter for now between one lakh
02:40:16.399 30 1 lakh 25 actually 1 lakh 25 to 1 lak
02:40:20.720 65 1 lakh 125 to 1 lakh 65
02:40:25.000 y the subsidy per scooter in Fame 2 used
02:40:29.520 to be about 40,000 rupees a scooter
02:40:32.359 60 now it is 40 20 22 so your cost of
02:40:37.160 bike from 125 to 165 is going to that's
02:40:40.319 our selling price my my cost is
02:40:42.920 different what is your
02:40:44.520 cost
02:40:48.800 margin sticking in anybody will find out
02:40:51.560 right what is
02:40:53.960 it
02:40:55.960 155 um to that you have to add the
02:40:59.520 subsidy right because the subsid is
02:41:01.279 coming to the customer correct no to
02:41:04.080 them the 155 is the customer total price
02:41:06.160 which means 20 20 comes to us so in in
02:41:08.640 reality the the the selling price is one
02:41:11.720 one whatever this plus 20 in both the
02:41:13.800 cases that's act 5% and that's crazy
02:41:18.120 like if on a 1 lakh 165,000
02:41:23.240 scooter you get 60,000 on top of what
02:41:25.960 you sell for right used to yeah so if he
02:41:28.800 was getting 2
02:41:30.600 lakh no you have to account for GST so
02:41:33.080 do roughly so without GST if he was
02:41:35.600 getting paid 2 lakh 25,000 in May 23 now
02:41:39.520 he's getting paid 1ak 65,000 when he
02:41:41.520 sells the same scooter okay I'm going to
02:41:44.200 make an assume assumption that you're
02:41:46.760 spending 175,000 on a scooter you're
02:41:49.920 selling for 1
02:41:53.800 65,000 roundabout no we we it's it's
02:41:57.800 lesser okay let's say 1 lak 55 then
02:42:01.439 I you take some fine you take 1 l50 1
02:42:06.640 l50 so how do you work in a
02:42:11.000 ecosystem your cost for the same
02:42:13.479 Commodities have not gone down
02:42:14.800 significantly right I saw cost of batter
02:42:17.120 Sal has come down a bit a fair bit but
02:42:19.319 that's about maybe 10,000 rupees since
02:42:21.200 the start of this year Commodities
02:42:22.560 haven't that
02:42:25.040 much sales have come down by what
02:42:29.120 percentage
02:42:31.040 25% but still this is a significant hit
02:42:34.319 to your margin right yeah so this is
02:42:36.080 another question for anybody brave
02:42:39.640 enough to take up the job of building a
02:42:41.479 Ev today I have some friends who are
02:42:43.000 trying it there's ultraviolet there's
02:42:45.800 some guy trying to build a car called
02:42:47.520 Prue these are all Bangalore boys like
02:42:49.439 old friends of
02:42:50.640 mine how do they plan for action from
02:42:54.840 the government I know Fame 3 is coming
02:42:57.479 is there a prediction you can make
02:42:59.240 around Fame 3 to help someone new
02:43:00.880 started no actually can't and that's one
02:43:02.279 of the reasons why it's super difficult
02:43:04.040 right now in this environment to
02:43:05.399 actually be a startup trying to enter
02:43:07.680 breakthrough the space because you you
02:43:09.760 just have no
02:43:11.200 basis if you say I want to build a
02:43:14.080 product that I want to price at 40 but
02:43:16.240 that's still 22,000 subsidy what is this
02:43:18.200 goes down to zero cly you discover
02:43:20.319 margin in which case your burn goes up
02:43:22.359 massively right so your entry entry
02:43:25.399 point to building KN wheer in the market
02:43:26.960 today your table Stakes of just entering
02:43:28.960 this business in my opinion is about 100
02:43:31.200 million if you're bringing 100 million
02:43:33.479 you can enter the game and then you have
02:43:35.520 to raise a lot more right um the only
02:43:39.920 way out of it and that also requires a
02:43:41.600 ton of money is a phenomenal amount of
02:43:44.120 cost reduction m
02:43:46.560 which which we've been doing everybody
02:43:47.920 in the industry is doing but it's super
02:43:49.800 expensive now give you a sense I have a
02:43:51.920 th member R&D and we do very very heavy
02:43:54.240 analytics on this you're over thousand
02:43:55.600 member R&D yes that's I said is the
02:43:57.600 world's largest R&D for two wheelers
02:43:58.800 electric two wheelers and and we do very
02:44:01.279 heavy Antics on this and this is not a
02:44:02.720 thing right EV two wheelers are only big
02:44:04.800 in India right in Southeast Asia it's
02:44:06.960 three-wheelers four-wheelers I remember
02:44:09.399 reading taxes converted first in China
02:44:12.120 yeah I think that the the you know the
02:44:13.960 China Market is is uh a very different
02:44:16.960 organization it's highly commoditized
02:44:19.760 super cottage industry yeah so for
02:44:21.479 example there's companies that's making
02:44:23.040 mots and they specialize at very high
02:44:25.479 volume they make 2 million Motors so the
02:44:28.160 pricing is very low and they have type A
02:44:30.240 type B type c motor so if you're a two-
02:44:32.359 wheeler manufacturer you just go and say
02:44:33.880 I want that motor I want that controller
02:44:36.600 very inexpensive made in very high
02:44:38.279 volume right it's also replacement
02:44:40.080 markets easy I have standard Wheels I
02:44:42.040 have standard tires right um so a lot of
02:44:44.880 the battery packs are coming from you
02:44:47.080 know there's 1500 battery pack
02:44:48.960 manufacturers in China so you can just
02:44:51.600 almost commoditize it and look at it her
02:44:54.000 so when everything is commoditized then
02:44:56.600 you're just doing a frame and body
02:44:58.439 that's they're getting much simpler
02:45:00.080 Solutions they're not doing high-end
02:45:01.359 scooters they're doing basic scooters
02:45:03.000 for that the investments in those are
02:45:04.920 not very high so they're probably for
02:45:08.840 you know a few million dollars you can
02:45:11.000 start a two wheeler company right and be
02:45:13.720 and survive in that space
02:45:15.600 um and it makes sense but that's very
02:45:17.800 different from um you know uh you know
02:45:21.359 where India is or where the premium
02:45:23.240 Market that could only have happened in
02:45:24.880 China see because China the government
02:45:26.800 Force created supply and demand for
02:45:28.520 electric two wheelers correct so the way
02:45:30.439 these all these manufacturers came up is
02:45:32.680 you created Force created so many
02:45:34.319 suppliers like motor manufacturers I
02:45:36.479 remember when I started a her and I read
02:45:38.080 this ADB report they were 400
02:45:40.880 manufacturers building electric motors
02:45:43.040 for electric scooters in China
02:45:45.720 and and I don't know kund E2
02:45:47.560 manufacturing companies it's a super
02:45:49.040 fragmented Market uh but while the entry
02:45:53.120 barrier is small the reward is also
02:45:55.040 small because no company makes enough
02:45:57.840 margin to really build a large valuation
02:45:59.960 or large market cap uh there's just not
02:46:02.399 enough value captured by any real player
02:46:05.080 everybody is essentially a glorified
02:46:06.560 commodity manufacturer India's gone down
02:46:09.120 a very different path India has gone
02:46:11.240 down I would say the more the US path
02:46:13.240 you know nickel the what
02:46:15.680 uh tarun was
02:46:18.000 saying at the top level on a policy the
02:46:21.120 government is very aligned but there's
02:46:23.600 this gap between the vision and the
02:46:27.279 implementation so one example what we
02:46:30.319 talked about is a PL scheme the same
02:46:32.920 thing is coming for the ACC right it's
02:46:35.279 only given to a few players very big
02:46:37.359 players which means there'll be some of
02:46:39.399 them will be very successful but that
02:46:41.120 doesn't build the entire industry up
02:46:43.160 right how do you create a sort of level
02:46:45.160 playing field on policy so when you
02:46:47.319 think of when you look at the GST right
02:46:50.520 electric vehicles at 5% GST but uh a
02:46:54.240 battery back right batteries are at
02:46:57.560 18% right so um uh it's also hard a for
02:47:04.479 a lot of companies only making electric
02:47:06.359 vehicles where they'll have an inverted
02:47:07.680 Duty structure because the input will
02:47:10.040 over time be more than your output that
02:47:12.000 happens to us no right we Lo in tons of
02:47:14.120 money every month will not be that will
02:47:16.000 not be an issue for a company that also
02:47:18.560 has an IC engine business because there
02:47:20.439 your GST is 28% so now if you're an EV
02:47:24.080 specific company you're a disadvantage
02:47:26.160 in a company that is EV and I if you
02:47:29.359 take that again to
02:47:31.520 swapping because batter is at 18% and
02:47:35.200 now you separate them out suddenly the
02:47:37.279 batter is at 18 but the vehicle's at
02:47:39.040 five now when a customer goes to swap
02:47:41.760 this Auto driver is paying 18% tax crazy
02:47:46.600 on right so that should really be 5% so
02:47:50.040 there's a gap if the government saying
02:47:51.720 we want e to be at 5 then the inverted
02:47:54.880 Duty structure should disappear and
02:47:56.840 services related to that for charging
02:47:59.160 and swapping should come at 5 right
02:48:02.840 subsidies let's say tomorrow I mean
02:48:04.920 today we have one of our oems a PR show
02:48:07.880 in their showroom there's a vehicle with
02:48:09.600 a fixed battery and one with swappable
02:48:12.600 both have identical Vehicles you can't
02:48:14.279 tell the difference between them you buy
02:48:16.399 the one with fix the customer subsidy
02:48:18.359 comes through to buy the one with
02:48:20.120 swappable the subsidy doesn't come
02:48:21.479 through the customer doesn't get it like
02:48:23.160 he's today passing the subsidy through
02:48:25.920 so these
02:48:27.160 anomalies are are really challenging
02:48:29.960 where they've not created a clear
02:48:32.680 technology agnostic plan and that's why
02:48:35.479 I think there's a big gap between like
02:48:37.720 he just said between and once this is in
02:48:39.439 place everyone's going round and round
02:48:41.800 there has to be a far more holistic
02:48:43.439 thinking that how
02:48:45.920 policies with Technologies and be
02:48:47.960 agnostic things change over time you
02:48:49.840 can't say some things like this but if
02:48:51.560 you create in fundamental ways of
02:48:53.240 thinking then all of them will flourish
02:48:56.359 and come through uh but today it's
02:48:58.920 highly disadvantageous for for companies
02:49:01.600 in this way and that's not the right
02:49:03.760 thing we should be doing we should
02:49:04.840 actually like you said promoting younger
02:49:07.120 startups allowing know that the
02:49:10.160 whichever way you go the customer still
02:49:11.880 gets a subsidy the same way all policies
02:49:13.960 are similar right and give benefit if
02:49:16.960 anything to startups that's how us and
02:49:19.520 everything has I mean if I look at the
02:49:21.239 at the right time when Tesla was almost
02:49:24.040 going off right they got $500 million
02:49:27.479 from VC backed by $500 million from the
02:49:30.080 government right that billion dollars at
02:49:32.640 that right time made Tesla what it was
02:49:36.040 right that's what I mean if we're doing
02:49:38.560 that to companies today and supporting
02:49:41.359 it a very different situation but cost
02:49:44.160 saving per vehicle I wanted to ask you
02:49:46.000 as well yeah how how much does it cost
02:49:48.800 you to Ferry a passenger for 1 kilomet
02:49:52.800 on your vehicle versus a IC car I can
02:49:57.359 talk for um uh the kilometer in our case
02:50:00.800 is about 22 bucks 18 to 20 20 bucks
02:50:04.520 depends on what product you take you
02:50:05.840 take a point to point ride or rental
02:50:08.160 it's in the range of about 18 to 22
02:50:09.920 Rupees is the now our brand promise
02:50:12.840 versus what is your cost see our cost is
02:50:16.640 uh lower but our utilization has to go
02:50:19.040 up to make at current at current
02:50:20.640 utilization I mean look if I were to say
02:50:22.880 a car should make about to be
02:50:25.080 self-sufficient to break even on all
02:50:27.439 should make about 3,200 rupees per day
02:50:29.600 to cover all my cost the car has to earn
02:50:32.279 me 3,200 rupees a day it includes driver
02:50:34.680 cost Le of the car that I'm paying onily
02:50:36.960 how much does the driver get paid on
02:50:38.200 average about 800 rupees on the Lower
02:50:40.760 Side 1,000 rupes on the higher side so
02:50:42.600 driver takes that the car Emi or the
02:50:45.560 lease on daily basis monthly divided by
02:50:47.800 number of days is about 800 rupees
02:50:50.200 parking charging all the paraph is about
02:50:53.120 580 600 rupees then the miscellaneous is
02:50:56.040 your toll and your other cost that's
02:50:57.920 about 400 500 rupees um it all comes
02:51:01.279 down to about 3,000 3,250 and the call
02:51:03.239 has cost has been reducing drastically
02:51:04.800 it was only 3,500 now it came down to
02:51:06.920 also just out of like I have heard that
02:51:08.800 in
02:51:09.640 scooters if let's say a Honda activ
02:51:12.840 Honda Activa costs 9 ,000 rupees a
02:51:15.560 scooter their bikes cost a lak and a
02:51:18.080 half no no not apples Apple stles would
02:51:21.080 be 120 120 so what I've heard is if
02:51:26.760 somebody were to ride the scooter for 40
02:51:28.880 kilm a day they save 35,000 rupees a
02:51:31.640 year in terms of cost of energy in
02:51:35.720 fairing that vehicle accurate yes 25
02:51:38.760 25,000 25,000 is there a number like
02:51:41.560 that for your car so that's what
02:51:42.880 mentioned that if you run a lack
02:51:44.760 kilometers at a rupee 25 PES rupe 50 PES
02:51:48.439 L kilometers would be how much per day
02:51:50.319 so I mean you would be driving 250 km
02:51:53.680 because at 200 km you're doing about uh
02:51:56.840 6,000 km a month 72,000 km a year so for
02:52:00.319 driving I'm just giving a ballpark
02:52:01.680 number yeah okay let's come down to
02:52:03.439 72,000 km only no this would also help
02:52:06.120 me make up my mind if I should buy a
02:52:07.800 data I or electric no you should
02:52:09.600 definitely buy electric I'll give you a
02:52:10.880 Layman number if you run 3,000 km a
02:52:13.760 month on G your bill will be 3,000
02:52:16.479 rupees see for for simple Ma and then IC
02:52:21.239 it will be much more I mean uh your cost
02:52:23.200 be about 2,000 per K depends I mean
02:52:25.840 depending what car you using SC 30,000
02:52:28.040 versus 3,000 actually n for you it'll
02:52:30.920 never make the ROI see unless you buy a
02:52:33.399 lowc cost electric car if you buy like a
02:52:35.560 see the problem is the asset cost of an
02:52:36.960 electric car is so high that the
02:52:38.880 kilometer saving is only worth it if you
02:52:41.479 buy a car in the 10 to 20 lak range m if
02:52:44.680 you buy like a 80 lakh 40 even a 40 lakh
02:52:47.800 electric car you don't have an Ry unless
02:52:50.160 you run it like 100 km a day okay so
02:52:52.720 what I see a lot of people now they're
02:52:54.560 shifting to Electric because they're
02:52:55.760 saving on the fuel cost right they're
02:52:57.920 not looking at the Emi of the car
02:52:59.120 because that's anyways yeah in Emi
02:53:01.319 they're paying over seven years that's a
02:53:03.120 massive saving so between a scoda rapid
02:53:05.239 and MG Electric the differential is
02:53:07.479 21,000 rupes you have 6 rupees per unit
02:53:10.080 kilow hour for the BST meter say 50 Kow
02:53:13.399 battery it's about 00 rupes the range of
02:53:16.080 the car is 350 but I'm saying 300 rupes
02:53:18.160 300 km 300 divid by 31 rupe per
02:53:20.359 kilometer here you remember old school
02:53:23.319 people used to sell cell phones like
02:53:26.399 AT&T You' buy like a Blackberry back in
02:53:28.960 the day then AT&T started this thing
02:53:30.880 that don't buy the cell phone pay me a
02:53:32.479 monthly fee every month right wouldn't
02:53:34.880 that be a natural next step for you guys
02:53:37.680 because you are saving the monthly cost
02:53:39.920 why sell a scooter if you can say pay me
02:53:41.680 5,000 bucks a month and use it that's I
02:53:44.520 we do in our Mobility service right we
02:53:46.040 give you vehicle energy data services
02:53:49.359 all integrated with maintenance and all
02:53:52.239 you run your business so we give that
02:53:54.399 full solution wouldn't that make sense
02:53:55.880 to you we failed when we attempted it
02:53:57.680 you attempted it we attempted a variant
02:54:00.040 of it um so I do believe in it and I
02:54:04.120 still do and I'm hoping that we learn
02:54:05.760 how to crack it but back in
02:54:08.319 2020 um so what happened for us is we
02:54:10.760 were selling our vehicles at 1.2 lakhs
02:54:12.439 back then and there was this moment of
02:54:14.720 Reckoning startup and loss is too high
02:54:17.439 for every vehicle that we sell so I went
02:54:18.960 back to basics did the math concluded
02:54:20.920 that if you do everything right from a
02:54:22.319 engineering we'll bring the cost low
02:54:24.040 down enough that but even then we can't
02:54:27.040 profitably sell this at 1.2 to make
02:54:29.200 money selling this vehicle we need to up
02:54:30.960 the price we need to make we need to
02:54:32.960 make the price 1 lak 60 so in one shot
02:54:35.479 we had to go from 1 l20 to 1 l60
02:54:38.279 obviously nobody's really got the like
02:54:40.720 really announce it very quickly but I'm
02:54:42.960 convinced but maybe maybe that's the
02:54:44.840 opportunity for an entrepreneur buy your
02:54:47.040 bike start a leasing so so while we did
02:54:50.160 make it announce at 1 lakh 160 as a way
02:54:52.800 of sort of you know softening the BL
02:54:54.399 blow we said actually version of battery
02:54:57.000 swapping we said uh you could take a
02:54:59.000 battery on subscription okay from us
02:55:01.960 which basically means the batter is in
02:55:03.080 the vehicle it will never be removed
02:55:05.960 except that you don't own the battery
02:55:07.680 you just SP a monthly fee so you can get
02:55:09.640 the vehicle for only 90,000 rupees or
02:55:11.640 999,000 rupees but why do you think
02:55:13.560 90,000 should have been like free check
02:55:15.640 their credit score charge 5,000 bucks a
02:55:18.200 month so let me tell you the problems
02:55:20.120 that we ran into right uh and we said,
02:55:22.760 1500 rupees plan 18800 rupes plan lot of
02:55:25.200 complications we came with enormous
02:55:28.160 massive Community pull back like push
02:55:30.080 back like because the biggest feedback
02:55:33.319 that we got was that vehicle is still
02:55:36.279 such a passionate emotional purchase for
02:55:39.000 me I need to own this so I'm not going
02:55:42.040 to pay you a lifetime fee for this okay
02:55:44.239 you tell me when does this Emi stop I'm
02:55:47.600 emiem like I been trying to make a
02:55:49.439 subscription product and make a lot of
02:55:50.680 money out of this they're like you tell
02:55:52.040 us 2 years 3 years four years when does
02:55:53.600 the Emi stop so ultimately I need to own
02:55:56.160 this battery this is a very emotional
02:55:57.600 thing it might work in another country
02:55:59.840 so we can convince them I think we would
02:56:02.040 all agree that a transition to EV is
02:56:04.560 happening even suruchi right absolutely
02:56:07.160 no no doubt I she was in
02:56:10.640 agreement unfortunately even I just on
02:56:14.680 our way here you see so many EV
02:56:17.279 showrooms right and I'm just talking
02:56:18.960 about cars here um the revolution is
02:56:23.000 here I've never seen everything like
02:56:25.200 this come together right a you think
02:56:27.399 Energy prices have come down and crossed
02:56:29.920 over look at government support I mean
02:56:32.160 I'm going back in my side 20 years ago
02:56:33.880 we still have challenges tun have spoke
02:56:35.560 about it but they have Fame they have
02:56:38.479 Road tax exemptions they have a lot of
02:56:40.359 concessions governments are for it right
02:56:42.960 if I look at back battery pricing the
02:56:44.760 way it's come down if I look at
02:56:45.920 technology Innovations today the
02:56:47.680 performance you get from these vehicles
02:56:49.760 if I look at consumers today are W to
02:56:51.880 look at electric 10 years ago they
02:56:53.640 weren't you at least have it in your
02:56:55.560 area none of so it's very rare that
02:56:58.880 every piece of it has come together
02:57:01.840 right I think that's where you have the
02:57:03.279 macro conditions are absolutely perfect
02:57:06.399 today for this industry EV ad option is
02:57:08.800 imminent I mean you can't probably just
02:57:10.520 about and that hasn't happened I'm just
02:57:12.080 seeing it in 20 years I you know you see
02:57:13.720 the
02:57:14.680 and you look at everything not
02:57:16.920 everything has to come together to
02:57:18.319 really make it happen I think that's
02:57:19.640 where you are today no I was trying to
02:57:21.359 create discourse so you know personally
02:57:24.800 I'm looking to invest in eveve and I've
02:57:26.479 been researching a whole bunch of
02:57:28.080 companies not just in eveve but energy
02:57:31.439 transition per se uh carbon tax uh a big
02:57:36.560 part of Tesla's revenue for many years
02:57:39.080 has been coming from carbon credits not
02:57:40.960 so much today but at least in the very
02:57:43.399 early years
02:57:45.160 do you think such a thing will happen in
02:57:46.960 India and that could be the inflection
02:57:48.840 point for EES there is a carbon tax in
02:57:52.120 conversation and they've put out a
02:57:54.000 framework for estimating this tax based
02:57:57.359 on which part of the value chain you're
02:57:59.800 based out of it's still complicated and
02:58:01.920 we're still trying to get through it and
02:58:04.120 understand what the outcome is I'm I'm
02:58:07.000 almost certain carbon taxes headed our
02:58:10.319 in India do you think the world will be
02:58:12.359 taxed at the same rate and do you think
02:58:14.160 that would be the world or India the
02:58:16.160 world I think what's carbon tax only
02:58:18.560 works if everybody's I think what's
02:58:20.520 going to happen is we are going to be
02:58:21.680 forced into it because that example
02:58:24.840 that's going to happen to us multiple
02:58:26.160 times and I know that folks like Niti
02:58:27.840 are already annoyed by it that all the
02:58:29.399 goras are going to tax the heck out of
02:58:30.720 us with carbon right they've grown on
02:58:33.239 the back of carbon like yeah so now it's
02:58:35.960 time to tax us yeah so I know I I do
02:58:38.399 believe I can already see it at some
02:58:39.840 extent that policy makers can see it
02:58:41.399 coming that we will be taxed first as a
02:58:43.359 country
02:58:44.760 and so that's one factor it'll
02:58:46.239 eventually flow through the other thing
02:58:47.720 is the the only thing government really
02:58:50.080 can do is like the EV transition the
02:58:54.000 green energy transition has to be
02:58:56.040 financially supported in some way it
02:58:58.560 could be a tax incentive it could be a
02:59:00.160 subsidy it could be a p it could be
02:59:02.160 whatever right like of support and the
02:59:04.239 scale has to be bu to G like a gigantic
02:59:06.800 scale
02:59:08.120 right at some point like for example in
02:59:11.279 electric EVS are kind of taking on on
02:59:14.000 its own like without any support also a
02:59:16.800 fantastic opportunity is to then tax the
02:59:19.239 vehicles that anyways are sort of on a
02:59:21.359 on a downtrend nobody's really like
02:59:24.200 lobbying for them now so I think a
02:59:26.800 carbon tax will find its way into
02:59:28.319 everything Vehicles my proposal Blu
02:59:30.760 Smart's proposal officially and I was on
02:59:32.200 the CII mobility chair chairperson last
02:59:34.680 year chairman for Mobility service and
02:59:36.680 my recommendation was even to CI and to
02:59:39.000 the Delhi government was impose ultra
02:59:42.680 low emission Zone charge could be any
02:59:45.160 price you come up with with your
02:59:46.319 consultant or some adviser charge each
02:59:49.680 CNG petrol diesel car this amount
02:59:52.359 collect that money make a pool use that
02:59:54.359 for building public charging in besides
02:59:56.960 what we we both are doing government
02:59:58.439 also comes in uses that pool to set up
03:00:00.080 charging delh Delhi a started this
03:00:03.640 almost 12 13 years ago they created the
03:00:05.720 ambient air quality fund which taxed a
03:00:09.080 certain PESA for every liter of diesel
03:00:10.920 and petrol and that put it into this
03:00:13.200 ambient air quality fund which will only
03:00:14.680 be used for EVS the reason Delhi still
03:00:17.560 has a subsidy Corpus and is still able
03:00:20.200 to give you know indust National is from
03:00:22.239 its ambient equality fund that was
03:00:23.840 started over 12 years ago right so it
03:00:26.000 already has this which came in the time
03:00:28.160 of Sheila dikshit right that time um and
03:00:31.560 that's sustained it um that's why you
03:00:34.760 you have the best city incentives yeah
03:00:37.160 in any place in the country is in Delhi
03:00:38.920 and it's it's continuing it's gone on
03:00:41.080 for years because they just had the cour
03:00:42.840 process buil up I only hope when a
03:00:45.000 carbon tax comes it is not applied per
03:00:48.000 person but more on usage it should be
03:00:50.840 applied on usage because we as Indians
03:00:52.920 use significantly lesser energy even
03:00:54.960 today than the West right yeah okay last
03:00:58.040 question guys tell me one
03:01:03.160 suggestion you would make to a budding
03:01:05.800 entrepreneur who's 20 years old what
03:01:08.800 should he do in the entirety of the
03:01:11.560 conversation we had one low hanging
03:01:14.080 fruit he should start a business around
03:01:16.239 I'll start with Punit and then I'm
03:01:18.359 pretty convinced um battery recycling is
03:01:21.120 a massive that was my S that's a massive
03:01:23.680 opportunity I mean I would not say do
03:01:25.479 charging because we are doing it a low
03:01:27.800 hanging fruit I mean if the EV option is
03:01:29.800 imminent massive opportunity to build
03:01:32.600 but because we are doing it so I I
03:01:34.080 would't request somebody else to come
03:01:35.640 and compete with us so what we don't
03:01:37.760 want to do and is to do battery cycling
03:01:40.319 so wish you all the very best you can do
03:01:42.560 that big opportunity Go dreams Waste
03:01:45.359 Management EV Waste Management yeah that
03:01:47.520 also could be another related party it's
03:01:49.760 in same recycl but suuchi I'm genuinely
03:01:54.160 thinking about setting up uh EV
03:01:57.200 charging at our offices but with the
03:02:00.040 hopes that eventually the electrons may
03:02:02.399 we produce a lot of hydrogen when we're
03:02:04.279 testing we have like a demo plant it
03:02:06.000 produces 10 to 25 kilos that that's a
03:02:08.600 sufficiently large quantity of
03:02:10.960 electricity as long as we get uh good
03:02:13.920 enough fuel cell to convert that to
03:02:16.080 electricity maybe you should set up One
03:02:18.120 charging facility in every industrial
03:02:20.800 complex I feel like it makes a lot of
03:02:22.399 sense because there is a lot of off
03:02:23.920 gases that don't always get consumed
03:02:26.200 testing downtime etc etc and and that'
03:02:29.080 be just enough there are cars in
03:02:31.560 jamshedpur that drive people around you
03:02:33.520 can't really walk it's a huge plant
03:02:35.520 seems like a wonderful opportunity Chan
03:02:39.080 so if I see the next 5 to seven years
03:02:42.040 and I think of entrepreneurs it's hard
03:02:44.520 to get a lot of money initially right
03:02:48.359 and what do you do therefore from that
03:02:50.279 perspective that allows you to enter a
03:02:52.640 business and grow it I think the way
03:02:55.439 energy and Mobility is going to shape up
03:02:58.040 the intersection of that is going to be
03:02:59.600 a data play and an AI play and a lot of
03:03:03.200 uh analytics coming in and this um is
03:03:06.720 going to be new for these new businesses
03:03:08.760 right so I do believe there's a large
03:03:11.720 opportunity where a lot of entrepreneurs
03:03:14.800 in India who've got that with these
03:03:16.920 policy changes and these markets coming
03:03:18.920 in right so these markets don't exist
03:03:21.160 and if they going to get bigger you're
03:03:22.520 going to find a way to connect them and
03:03:24.399 there aren't Solutions today you're
03:03:25.880 doing something we're doing something
03:03:27.239 but there's going to be much bigger
03:03:29.080 pieces of that solution so I think
03:03:30.560 that's a good opportunity which is new
03:03:33.040 which is global which is data AI
03:03:36.680 integrated and probably allows people to
03:03:39.920 look at a particular problem that's very
03:03:42.000 specific to say blue smart or us or
03:03:44.840 someone else and solve that and say in
03:03:47.319 the process solving this I'm giving a
03:03:49.080 value and I can get in quickly and and
03:03:52.200 make that happen I would say Builder
03:03:55.439 adapter I'm am not knowledgeable here so
03:03:57.960 I'm WR I'm writing like Marvel Comics
03:03:59.880 while I'm saying this build a adapter
03:04:03.160 for whatever electric vehicle you have
03:04:05.720 which makes it compatible with what he
03:04:07.720 has what he has what you have and then
03:04:10.760 map out where all the charging
03:04:12.760 facilities of India are and figure out a
03:04:15.680 way to communicate with them and find
03:04:17.239 the is very expensive we'll make it
03:04:21.640 cheaper um so two ideas one I would say
03:04:26.120 um if you look at southeast Asia two
03:04:28.600 wheeler penetration is very high if you
03:04:30.640 look at the rest of the world overall
03:04:31.880 Automotive penetration is very high so
03:04:33.560 we are going to sell a lot of vehicles
03:04:35.160 still and it's uh and I think personal
03:04:37.160 mob is not going away obviously it's
03:04:38.760 going to be pretty big especially as
03:04:40.160 Indians become richer I think for a
03:04:42.200 while we're going to be in that phase
03:04:43.200 where
03:04:43.920 everybody will have aspirations you want
03:04:45.200 to buy more build a new form factor I
03:04:48.279 think electric allows that opportunity
03:04:51.200 that ice did not allow you ice kind of
03:04:54.040 bucketed because of Technology only a
03:04:56.239 few form factors for you car or two
03:04:58.399 wheeler I think electric allows you the
03:05:01.479 opportunity to for example the entire M
03:05:03.800 explosion with micromobility the Uli
03:05:05.880 form factor right and those vehicles I
03:05:08.200 think there many such opportunities so
03:05:09.520 if you want to start an OEM company
03:05:11.040 today don't just go and say h okay I a
03:05:13.399 build a scooter okay it's already like
03:05:16.239 like now happening for enough years
03:05:17.640 that's not disruptive go change a new
03:05:19.439 form attempt a new form factor I think
03:05:21.319 lot of opportunity second one is
03:05:23.800 something we failed at uh or didn't
03:05:25.840 succeed definitely didn't succeed at
03:05:27.200 that point but I think there's a big
03:05:28.680 opportunity and I agree with you guys
03:05:31.120 that yes there are I think a lot of
03:05:33.160 customers who want a different form of
03:05:36.000 ownership uh with with great Vehicles
03:05:38.960 which can be expensive crack that you
03:05:41.720 can you can just simplify and say crack
03:05:43.319 subscription model for but but own the
03:05:46.200 vehicle not like a daily subscription
03:05:47.800 right how do I give you the sense of
03:05:50.200 ownership um these fancy car companies
03:05:53.399 have that no Mercedes Le and buyback
03:05:55.720 yeah but somehow they somehow they're
03:05:57.680 not like really flying off right like so
03:06:00.319 how how do you make this work for a very
03:06:02.080 large Chun of customers suddenly I think
03:06:04.279 there's a big opportunity there and
03:06:05.880 again electric and specially connected
03:06:07.359 Vehicles amazing enabling platform right
03:06:10.520 connected High vehicle can be tracked at
03:06:12.680 all points you know the usage you know
03:06:14.800 where to send them for charging so I
03:06:16.680 think the ecosystem is really well set
03:06:18.560 for this kind of a company to be built I
03:06:21.399 think both opportunities are there and
03:06:24.200 uh surprisingly in both at least the
03:06:26.760 latter a lot of people thought about it
03:06:28.560 but nobody's really cracked every
03:06:29.640 company who talked about cracking
03:06:31.040 subscription quickly quietly became a
03:06:32.840 financing company everybody uh I think
03:06:35.960 so the opportunity is still pretty
03:06:37.080 pretty pretty much open uh and so is the
03:06:39.800 opportunity for a new form
03:06:41.560 factor okay last part at the end of
03:06:44.640 every episode we do something which is
03:06:48.680 going to help young
03:06:50.680 entrepreneurs or something charitable in
03:06:53.960 nature or funding a company which would
03:06:56.000 have otherwise not got funded I ask each
03:06:59.160 of you to give away a certain amount of
03:07:02.080 money whatever you want to commit to and
03:07:05.359 then we will find a project together we
03:07:07.200 will find that young bright mind
03:07:09.600 somewhere who could both use your
03:07:12.000 mentorship all of you and also your
03:07:14.160 money as a grant or as a as funding into
03:07:18.439 his
03:07:19.600 Venture so you guys can commit an amount
03:07:22.200 and then we'll reconvene and we'll go
03:07:23.840 through the list of entries and we'll
03:07:25.560 select the final one yeah who would like
03:07:28.040 to start so if it's an investment
03:07:30.600 opportunity I think I can put five lakhs
03:07:33.080 okay CH then I would also look as
03:07:35.560 investment opportunity in fact even
03:07:37.760 given my time if I find that idea is
03:07:39.920 really good yeah I think time is more
03:07:41.120 Val right and uh you know if the
03:07:44.160 investment opportun is good i' put 25
03:07:45.840 lakhs okay SOI how about like a lakh to
03:07:50.120 two lakhs for sure okay and anywhere
03:07:53.040 between I mean 10 15 25 depending on the
03:07:55.720 opportunities you should be really EXC
03:07:57.279 okay let's say between 10 to 25 and I'll
03:07:59.319 also do 25 so we'll add it all up and
03:08:02.040 we'll have a nice we'll find somebody
03:08:04.319 really who deserves that money somebody
03:08:06.279 young and like brilliant yeah it has to
03:08:08.239 be really there a lot of good Hardware
03:08:10.080 attempts happening yeah we'll pick one
03:08:12.319 don't get money and could could deserve
03:08:15.080 the money done super so thank you each
03:08:18.239 one of you for taking how many of what 6
03:08:21.560 hours about 6 hours today is it 6 hours
03:08:24.200 yeah it's close to cut cut yeah done
03:08:26.800 done done thanks thank you so
03:08:42.000 much
