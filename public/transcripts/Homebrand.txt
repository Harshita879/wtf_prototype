00:00:00.399 so I have been looking into consumption
00:00:04.000 and each one of you I will explain how
00:00:06.520 but brings a totally different insight
00:00:09.800 into
00:00:10.750 [Music]
00:00:15.800 consumption I want people who want to
00:00:18.240 build a brand today young guys 0 to one
00:00:21.359 to learn everything from all of your
00:00:26.570 [Music]
00:00:28.640 experience do
00:00:30.150 [Music]
00:00:37.000 so I have been looking into consumption
00:00:40.760 we created a fund to invest into
00:00:43.719 companies around
00:00:46.320 consumption uh there seems to be a
00:00:49.480 double standard in a way wherein the
00:00:52.480 reported numbers on the top are looking
00:00:55.120 good but everyone I talk to on the
00:00:57.760 ground is talking about how consumption
00:01:01.160 seems to have dropped in the last two or
00:01:03.079 three months uh this could be in travel
00:01:05.880 this could be in fashion this could be
00:01:08.520 eCommerce uh across
00:01:11.799 segments very
00:01:13.920 unlike uh year leading up to an election
00:01:16.960 consumption seems to be dropping uh as
00:01:19.759 an investor and also talking to people
00:01:22.439 who want to build a brand from Z to one
00:01:24.520 or to scale a brand in consumption which
00:01:27.720 I broadly believe is the larger India
00:01:30.439 opportunity we have too few independent
00:01:33.600 Indian brands in consumption which have
00:01:35.880 scaled uh so I thought this would be
00:01:37.960 opportune the timing is great and each
00:01:41.200 one of you I will explain how but brings
00:01:44.280 a totally different insight into
00:01:46.719 consumption don't be fooled by Raj I
00:01:48.960 think people have seen one facet of Raj
00:01:52.880 but the other more interesting facet I
00:01:54.880 think we'll all get to learn today as I
00:01:56.920 have in my time with Raj uh since you're
00:02:00.320 here for the first time would you like
00:02:02.680 to tell us a bit about yourself how did
00:02:06.719 anun begin where did he begin how did
00:02:09.280 you arrive at Mena or creating Mena give
00:02:13.160 us like a few minutes I just want to
00:02:14.640 make sure it's not boring yeah actually
00:02:16.959 by chance and a little bit a random path
00:02:20.360 I did 15 years in Consulting before that
00:02:22.400 start from the very beginning born born
00:02:25.280 in Chennai grew up in Chennai did
00:02:28.360 engineering parents
00:02:30.280 my father was a professional worked in
00:02:32.120 the Auto industry he worked at a company
00:02:34.959 Hindustan Motors uh which actually I
00:02:37.599 think makes or used to make among the
00:02:39.480 more iconic cars the Ambassador and the
00:02:42.120 contesta so he sort of did that um so I
00:02:46.480 grew up in Chennai but I spent a bit of
00:02:48.480 time in Kolkata bit of time in indor all
00:02:51.280 of that um did engineering which seemed
00:02:53.840 like the logical thing at that time you
00:02:55.360 know you did engineering or were a
00:02:57.480 doctor the startup was actually hadn't
00:03:01.239 really you know made it this was 94 was
00:03:05.480 when I graduated um so 98 is when I
00:03:09.159 graduated from college and then I went
00:03:11.239 and did engineering again and I always
00:03:14.000 thought I wanted to be an auto guy um my
00:03:16.360 dream job actually at that point was to
00:03:18.159 design engines at cumins um instead I
00:03:21.000 joined McKenzie which is a consulting
00:03:22.440 firm um they paid slightly more I had a
00:03:25.280 loan how much did McKenzie pay back in
00:03:27.720 the day McKenzie at that time for an
00:03:29.959 would pay
00:03:31.040 $50,000 wow and this was in the US I'm
00:03:33.560 guess in the US so I joined in the US
00:03:35.560 and they were hiring Engineers they were
00:03:37.200 hiring Engineers so I was among the
00:03:39.400 first Automotive manufacturing analyst
00:03:42.239 type Engineers that they hired at that
00:03:43.959 time Miki was getting into Auto and
00:03:46.480 operations so since I didn't do
00:03:48.840 Automotive in real life I thought I'll
00:03:50.400 do it through Consulting I always
00:03:52.120 thought I do it for two years I ended up
00:03:54.239 staying for 15 so lived in China for
00:03:57.280 about 3 four years us 67 and then came
00:04:01.079 back and spent about four five years
00:04:03.200 China when 2002 to 2005 so anyway to got
00:04:08.120 the long story short did McKenzie for a
00:04:09.560 long time I came back to India because
00:04:12.319 my wife wanted to come back to a family
00:04:14.439 run business Diagnostic lab so we came
00:04:16.959 back to Chennai and started the McKenzie
00:04:18.399 office there uh did that got elected
00:04:20.880 senior partner and then left did minra
00:04:23.759 which is my fashion experience which is
00:04:25.240 quite unusual how did you go from that
00:04:26.919 to being CE of minra um a bit again I
00:04:30.800 think um I met sain bini and Mukesh um
00:04:35.199 what did you think of them
00:04:37.160 personally what did I think of them
00:04:38.880 personally I think each of them brought
00:04:40.759 very very different things to the table
00:04:42.720 U Mukesh was all about people in culture
00:04:44.880 sain was all about Vision big picture
00:04:48.000 Benny was the Ops guy execution Ops Etc
00:04:50.880 so I thought they were a very
00:04:51.680 interesting group of people they had
00:04:53.160 just bought minra when I met them I
00:04:55.759 actually this happened because one of
00:04:57.240 the good and the bad their friends of
00:04:58.520 mine they won't feel bad they friends of
00:05:00.360 mine as well what is the bad part you
00:05:02.199 said really no I think the bad part is
00:05:04.560 by the way I think they could have
00:05:05.600 figured out more complimentarity amongst
00:05:07.120 each other they didn't get along I think
00:05:09.720 at that time they all got along now I
00:05:11.800 think as things evolve and companies
00:05:13.440 evolve I think they all evolved into
00:05:14.840 very different people who was right and
00:05:16.080 who was wrong amongst the three of I
00:05:17.440 don't think uh one was right or one was
00:05:19.440 wrong I think by the way it is still the
00:05:21.880 most successful exit that I think India
00:05:24.840 has produced so I think they did
00:05:26.280 something right much more right than
00:05:28.160 wrong uh since or their friend maybe you
00:05:30.440 know a little bit more but um uh but
00:05:33.840 essentially uh I so it happened by
00:05:36.080 chance so I do a lot of stuff based on
00:05:38.919 Instinct and people and some macros so
00:05:41.560 may not be quite like investing but you
00:05:43.600 know for me people matter so you make
00:05:45.759 the bet on the person and I thought they
00:05:47.880 always put the company first and I bet
00:05:49.840 on them I think e-commerce was a 10e
00:05:52.280 trend so bet on that what year was this
00:05:54.479 this was 2015 so 14 and 15 is when I
00:05:58.759 started with minra
00:06:00.240 and actually by the way uh fashion in
00:06:02.400 e-commerce was a very logical Choice
00:06:04.199 it's the only one with high gross
00:06:05.240 margins at that time I mean Beauty Etc
00:06:07.560 came much later so decided we'll try it
00:06:10.680 what's the worst that can happen uh
00:06:12.520 turned out to be great really enjoyed
00:06:14.360 the experience so that's was my first I
00:06:15.880 mean at that time by the way just to
00:06:17.319 give you perspective I didn't know the
00:06:19.319 difference between a knit and a woven I
00:06:21.080 never I mean I was an automotive a knit
00:06:23.440 garment and a woven garment or a denim I
00:06:26.120 mean I could tell a difference between a
00:06:28.120 casting and a forging but that was was n
00:06:29.680 particularly helpful um so did that for
00:06:32.800 4 years really enjoyed it uh thought
00:06:35.400 there was something interesting about
00:06:37.440 building um flip cart sold to Walmart
00:06:41.680 had thought I would be more
00:06:42.960 entrepreneurial how big was mintra
00:06:44.639 during your time it sort of went from
00:06:47.280 call it 2 250 million to a little over a
00:06:49.520 billion and a half of sales of sales gmv
00:06:52.520 would have been higher right um so it
00:06:55.520 went actually it was and the private
00:06:57.800 brand business of mintra at the same
00:06:59.840 time also went from 7 8% to call it
00:07:02.479 almost 30% which is what drove
00:07:04.479 profitability so we were among the most
00:07:05.919 profitable pieces of the flip cart
00:07:08.080 ecosystem not amongst we were the most
00:07:09.639 profitable piece of the flipcart
00:07:10.759 ecosystem so I think it was quite
00:07:12.800 valuable um so did that then uh thought
00:07:16.400 I would do something more
00:07:17.720 entrepreneurial so I invested some money
00:07:19.759 into a company called medlife which is
00:07:21.319 an e- Pharmacy business why E Pharmacy I
00:07:24.120 think by the way here I should have done
00:07:25.400 more homework uh gross margins were
00:07:27.840 lower so I should have should have that
00:07:29.680 up but it seemed interesting it was uh
00:07:32.000 medlife was a company which was
00:07:33.440 completely privately funded so Prashant
00:07:36.639 was the founder part of the alham family
00:07:38.720 and Tushar basically put all of their
00:07:40.400 personal money in there were no external
00:07:42.800 investors uh it was a small business at
00:07:45.159 that time 40 50 crores a month relative
00:07:47.280 to the mintra scale right um so got in
00:07:50.720 got in as the CEO I also put in money I
00:07:52.840 bought 10% of the business um there were
00:07:55.599 no Exel investors so it was relatively
00:07:57.039 easy to put in money um put some money
00:07:59.440 in went through a humbling experience
00:08:01.599 trying to raise money MH uh you know I
00:08:04.080 had done a bunch of raising money
00:08:05.960 through the flip card ecosystem and
00:08:07.520 everything seemed easy um you sort of go
00:08:10.240 out independently and try and raise
00:08:11.520 money I think it's quite tough uh we
00:08:14.039 were not able to raise money at medlife
00:08:16.240 we went through multiple iterations I
00:08:18.639 think at that time if you remember we
00:08:20.599 work happened yeah right uh and then
00:08:23.280 everything went into a freeze and then
00:08:24.680 right after that Co happened so you know
00:08:26.720 you got into this but we got quite lucky
00:08:29.319 coid which destroyed many other
00:08:31.240 businesses actually created a huge
00:08:33.519 Tailwind for e- pharmacy right because
00:08:35.200 everybody started shopping online the
00:08:36.799 government changed uh regulations and
00:08:39.320 looked at it more favorably
00:08:40.760 consolidation started to happen net meds
00:08:43.039 got bought at that time by Reliance just
00:08:46.279 before this and then we were the
00:08:48.800 independent one 1 mg got bought by tatas
00:08:51.240 so we got bought by farm e um turned out
00:08:55.320 to be a very good deal at that point not
00:08:57.920 not but essentially they provided lots
00:09:00.480 of liquidity because after that they
00:09:01.640 continue to raise and raise and raise
00:09:03.120 right so after the pharmacy sort of buy
00:09:06.519 I was trying to figure out what I wanted
00:09:07.800 to do
00:09:09.680 um I could have gone and been an
00:09:12.040 investor or joined a venture capital
00:09:13.480 firm I you know you just did a podcast
00:09:15.720 recently but I felt like I was an
00:09:17.760 operator um just very interesting thing
00:09:20.519 I think is um in India we're mostly
00:09:24.200 still an unbranded Market I think in
00:09:26.920 almost all spaces especially in fashion
00:09:29.720 especially in fashion uh also true in
00:09:31.959 beauty also true in home decor which are
00:09:33.760 the three spaces that we are in so large
00:09:36.399 unbranded Market second is I think the
00:09:39.399 friction of building Brands is becoming
00:09:42.120 less you know call it for 140 150 rupees
00:09:46.600 maybe the rate has changed slightly but
00:09:48.720 140 150 rupees you can get to 23,000 PIN
00:09:50.839 codes over 26,000 you mean as a delivery
00:09:53.680 fee as a delivery fee I mean you know if
00:09:56.279 you think about unil you think about
00:09:57.760 Maro is that time depend dep if you want
00:09:59.640 to deliver in one day versus one week
00:10:01.839 does the price change last not really so
00:10:03.760 I think there's break points I think
00:10:05.560 there's a within two day two to 2 and a
00:10:07.240 half day delivery and then there is a 2
00:10:08.760 and a half to 5 six day delivery and is
00:10:10.800 that also based on weight it is based on
00:10:12.839 weight um so most of actually volume
00:10:16.600 value ratios are among the most
00:10:18.160 efficient in fashion and in Beauty right
00:10:21.720 it's very bad when you do large
00:10:23.480 appliances because you ship large
00:10:25.399 amounts of air so but now for at least
00:10:27.720 fashion that category where it's it's
00:10:29.200 not very heavy and not very volumetric
00:10:31.800 for 140 rupees you can get to or beauty
00:10:33.959 you can get to most parts of India so
00:10:35.800 you don't need a very large distribution
00:10:37.560 Network to reach customers at least in
00:10:39.360 the initial stages second I think brand
00:10:42.600 building now influence of brand building
00:10:44.839 happens a lot actually online e-commerce
00:10:49.480 and fashion is maybe 10 11%
00:10:52.920 roughly overall e-commerce is slightly
00:10:55.120 lower given grocery will bring it down
00:10:57.320 but I would say what is influence online
00:10:59.440 will be
00:11:00.279 50% right so brand building can happen
00:11:03.079 very differently so that was the second
00:11:04.360 thesis the third is it's very easy to
00:11:06.279 start in India very hard to scale in
00:11:07.720 India I think the scaling is boring it's
00:11:10.680 about efficiency you know we made jokes
00:11:12.720 about time and efficiency I think
00:11:14.120 efficiency is really what drives a lot
00:11:16.440 of scale you have to do Performance
00:11:17.760 Marketing well you to do sourcing well
00:11:19.760 you to design these are all like boring
00:11:21.560 things after you get the product Market
00:11:23.600 fit right to continue to scale and I
00:11:26.040 felt if you were to say 100 rupees spent
00:11:28.200 on fashion and India yeah how much is
00:11:30.600 spent where online versus offline online
00:11:33.560 will be 10 11 rupees right the rest will
00:11:36.000 be much organized how much is
00:11:37.120 unorganized I would say still I mean k
00:11:39.519 may also have a point of view on this by
00:11:41.279 I would say by the way 60% is still
00:11:43.800 disorganized right I think ready to
00:11:46.079 stitch is still a very large segment
00:11:48.920 most of ethnic which is a very large
00:11:50.399 portion of fashion is still unorganized
00:11:52.519 you go to your nearby Taylor you go to
00:11:54.040 your nearby store it's not really a
00:11:55.360 brand right is that close to being
00:11:58.200 disrupted
00:11:59.560 uh I think there is um I think it's a
00:12:03.040 5year journey I don't think it's like it
00:12:05.000 happens overnight right I think the
00:12:07.200 first big push has happened already so
00:12:11.279 to give you a sense nikil I think mintra
00:12:14.639 used to be when mintra started right
00:12:16.480 mintra used to be 2 3% fashion
00:12:18.399 penetration
00:12:19.440 online it's now 11% I mean obviously by
00:12:22.079 the way growth of mintra growth of ago
00:12:25.079 growth of XYZ between 2015 to now 2015
00:12:30.160 to now when the market itself is growing
00:12:32.399 and this is all branded right so I think
00:12:34.120 there's a real opportunity in my mind I
00:12:35.880 think it'll continue cyclically for the
00:12:37.680 next 5 10 years this penetration will go
00:12:40.040 up I think if I remember the numbers
00:12:42.320 correctly and this little outdated but
00:12:44.480 China is in the mid-20s in terms of
00:12:46.600 penetration in fashion the US is 1718 by
00:12:50.519 penetration you're talking about online
00:12:51.880 online penetration too as a as a as a
00:12:53.760 measure and how quickly is this Market
00:12:55.680 growing the overall Market is growing a
00:12:58.320 little bit over GDP branded is growing 2
00:13:00.920 3x faster because unbranded to branded
00:13:03.440 is happening and online by the way will
00:13:05.480 grow faster we can talk about the
00:13:07.040 current situation but if you take a
00:13:09.079 three four year view it's growing
00:13:10.760 reasonably fast and can you also explain
00:13:12.880 what Mensa is in the scale today yeah so
00:13:16.399 um I don't want to get into a lot of
00:13:18.199 scale and so on but I think we have it's
00:13:20.040 essentially a house of Brands uh we have
00:13:22.480 about 20 Brands we have brands in
00:13:24.440 Fashion Beauty and home why those three
00:13:26.160 categories one is because I knew
00:13:27.720 something about it second is it's high
00:13:29.120 gross margin category um also it's a
00:13:31.639 large stamp what are the margins
00:13:32.839 typically 50 60% gross margin right u in
00:13:36.320 in beauty of course it's higher but in
00:13:37.920 fashion at least 55 60 in Beauty 70 80
00:13:41.800 right uh depending on what area of
00:13:43.600 beauty that you get to perfumes is high
00:13:45.600 etc etc right so um we're trying to
00:13:48.360 build a house of Brands it's a very
00:13:49.440 simple thesis um we get buildings which
00:13:54.360 are half finished but with a good
00:13:56.079 basement and a good foundation and we
00:13:57.959 build them out into hopefully
00:13:59.440 skyscrapers right I mean the number of
00:14:01.639 thousand CR brands in the country is
00:14:03.680 very very very few right we spoke about
00:14:06.079 this a little while ago I think the goal
00:14:08.079 for me I think is over the next five
00:14:10.040 seven years could you build five 6,000
00:14:12.800 CR Brands right in each of these spaces
00:14:15.560 and I think it's possible I think you
00:14:16.839 can build them very differently you can
00:14:18.000 build them more efficiently lots of
00:14:19.920 lessons learned from the previous
00:14:21.320 experiences so trying to see if you can
00:14:23.240 do it more efficiently and effectively
00:14:26.000 this time men is doing about 200 million
00:14:28.320 now say yes and raised about 200 million
00:14:31.600 yes and not burning much money anymore
00:14:34.120 no we're not burning at the iida level
00:14:36.560 um money but I think you know there's
00:14:38.800 still working capital investment and so
00:14:40.160 on because a lot of people watching this
00:14:42.160 are not just entrepreneurs trying to
00:14:44.480 start a business y but also investors
00:14:47.360 right what is a good multiple to pay
00:14:50.279 while you're investing in a fashion a
00:14:53.199 and in a be Beauty B brand yeah so I
00:14:57.000 mean look from an e to EV multiple I
00:14:59.440 think you know a lot of the fmcg brands
00:15:03.160 trade at 4050 EV toida and I think
00:15:06.800 fashion by the what e to ad sorry uh
00:15:09.399 Enterprise Value to the earnings before
00:15:12.120 interest taxes depreciation entprise
00:15:14.720 value Enterprise Value is the overall
00:15:17.360 value of the business right which is
00:15:19.639 what is the value of the equity of the
00:15:21.639 business um what if I were to ask you
00:15:24.199 for a simpler M multiple in terms of
00:15:26.720 sales so I think a revenue multiple is
00:15:28.880 what I think you're looking for are you
00:15:30.279 considering sales as
00:15:32.160 Revenue I'm thinking it's the same in
00:15:34.800 this case right no I'm there is no gmv
00:15:36.680 when you're running a brand right so
00:15:38.639 when you're running a brand I think it's
00:15:40.240 accounting Revenue right I mean whatever
00:15:41.600 is my Whatever Gets recorded as
00:15:43.120 accounting Revenue are you also a
00:15:44.680 platform where you sell all the brands
00:15:45.959 no you're not no we're not so we do have
00:15:48.480 d2c sites for each of Our Brands but we
00:15:51.880 are not a platform I don't want to
00:15:53.480 compete with my end customers whether
00:15:56.160 it's a mintra or an Amazon or a Flipkart
00:15:58.240 right I think there by the way the cost
00:16:00.040 of traffic is very high and you've spent
00:16:02.519 a lot of money building it does that
00:16:04.360 make sense yeah so sales to so sales to
00:16:07.880 multiple I think varies niku my sense is
00:16:10.399 I think a 5x would be interesting 5x on
00:16:13.399 fashion would be interesting Beauty I
00:16:15.480 think between four and six no actually
00:16:17.480 maybe 6 s um I think food will be
00:16:22.360 probably lower uh will be food you mean
00:16:25.319 like qsr finr yeah yeah I mean in Mena
00:16:29.600 we don't do it but if you actually did
00:16:32.040 like um um a fresh food with with a
00:16:35.319 cloud kitchen type thing I think the
00:16:36.560 multiples will be low yeah is backward
00:16:38.959 integration a bit big part of yes uh we
00:16:42.880 would like to um we're starting to do a
00:16:45.600 little bit of it I mean we have one
00:16:47.160 peanut butter brand uh which has a
00:16:49.240 captive manufacturing because there I
00:16:50.920 mean literally you uh I mean The Taste
00:16:54.160 is everything it's a small machine yeah
00:16:55.639 yeah yeah it's a small machine as well
00:16:57.279 so um so we do that uh we would like to
00:17:00.519 backward integrate we would like to sort
00:17:01.880 of um make have more control over supply
00:17:04.359 chain but roughly nck going back a
00:17:06.959 little bit to what do we do just to
00:17:08.240 simplify a little bit right I think we
00:17:09.919 want to build Global consumer Brands out
00:17:12.480 of India I think we want to use
00:17:15.079 technology to do it slightly differently
00:17:17.079 and more Capital efficiently I think
00:17:18.559 that's it that's a little bit of what
00:17:19.959 we're trying to do if I had to phrase it
00:17:21.439 in my my own language can I say you pick
00:17:25.679 a bunch of mediumsized Brands yes and
00:17:28.520 Hope by putting them together adding
00:17:30.280 backward integration and Tech together
00:17:32.360 they'll be more valuable than they are
00:17:33.799 on their own uh not really I think by
00:17:36.320 the way the Synergy part of it is for
00:17:38.200 sure true MH um but I think the reality
00:17:41.520 is you do a lot of work in brand
00:17:42.960 building and growing them and so on
00:17:45.240 right so it's not just a Synergy across
00:17:46.960 a portfolio it is so we have 20 Brands
00:17:49.880 there are 10 brands that are what we
00:17:51.480 call breakout Brands which are growing
00:17:53.520 much much faster than the market
00:17:54.880 profitable blah blah blah so you really
00:17:56.880 invest in brand building in them so the
00:17:58.240 way I think about it is unil and PNG
00:18:02.000 built Brands a certain way because there
00:18:04.280 was a certain set of constraints I think
00:18:06.039 we can build Brands very differently
00:18:08.000 because the constraints are very
00:18:09.520 different and so over the next 10 year
00:18:11.600 period can you build out a fairly large
00:18:13.840 consumer brand business out of India but
00:18:16.200 I by the way think there's a global
00:18:17.480 opportunity because I think the
00:18:18.640 Arbitrage at some level both in
00:18:21.720 distribution and in sourcing is also
00:18:23.480 very high right so you can actually
00:18:25.159 build it out for the world and I think
00:18:27.080 that's the exciting opportunity
00:18:29.400 so by the end of today uh two objectives
00:18:33.559 one if somebody is starting a brand I
00:18:35.840 think a lot of people in India right now
00:18:37.679 want to start a a restaurant food brand
00:18:41.440 fashion brand makeup brand perfume brand
00:18:45.440 mixer brand there's so many different
00:18:48.000 things that people are trying to do
00:18:49.799 right I think we need to get them from
00:18:52.679 0er to one Y and walk through all the
00:18:55.880 intricacies of that we need to figure
00:18:57.760 out where the black holes are where
00:19:00.159 something needs to be built and if
00:19:02.320 you're building it how do you build it
00:19:03.840 but is there a way I can ask you some
00:19:05.480 questions the course okay good I'm
00:19:07.280 looking for what do you want to ask we
00:19:09.280 let it so we both went for breakfast
00:19:11.240 before
00:19:12.280 yesterday and uh he was being so KY
00:19:15.200 about so many personal details of his
00:19:17.840 life so Anand is a very colorful
00:19:20.440 character okay he collects wine he has
00:19:23.520 6,000 bottles of wine 3,000 but we're
00:19:26.000 not talk 3,000 3,000 bottles of wine
00:19:28.880 stored in a vault in Chicago and he's
00:19:32.159 obsessed with wine I know Kish is also
00:19:34.159 into wine so you both all I'm not at all
00:19:36.280 into wine but anyway you're not no okay
00:19:40.120 I know Raj is not into any of he doesn't
00:19:43.400 drink yeah but we'll come back to the
00:19:45.440 personal side of your story later Raj
00:19:48.360 needs no introduction Raj is more
00:19:50.559 popular than uh many people I know but
00:19:55.520 the one thing people don't know about
00:19:57.280 Raj is
00:19:59.480 uh his insight into consumption is
00:20:03.120 really different he has spent a large
00:20:06.000 part of his life building a detergent
00:20:07.919 brand Y and uh if I were to tell you a
00:20:11.679 personal story he started a new company
00:20:13.760 called House of X and when he was
00:20:17.520 starting that company we both were
00:20:19.400 talking about uh you know how we can
00:20:21.919 work together on it and the very very
00:20:25.520 impressive thing about Raj is we were
00:20:27.320 trying to beat him down on the valuation
00:20:29.000 and the price and trying to get 20% 30%
00:20:32.360 into this company because evidently we
00:20:34.960 believed in Raj and all that he can
00:20:37.159 accomplish but in 24 hours or 48 Hours
00:20:41.919 he went to another venture capital fund
00:20:44.320 uh light speed Y and he raised more
00:20:47.799 money at three times the valuation and
00:20:50.880 the duration between beginning and end
00:20:52.799 of that conversation was less than 48
00:20:54.720 hours fabulous and I found that
00:20:56.760 incredibly impressive impressive and
00:20:59.600 maybe you start there
00:21:01.320 what what convinced whoever at light
00:21:04.880 speed to hear your pitch and fire that
00:21:08.280 quickly is it just that Indian VCS don't
00:21:10.240 do diligence or is it something
00:21:13.720 else I I genuinely don't know about this
00:21:17.799 honestly I think uh what worked I think
00:21:20.919 two or three things which I would like
00:21:24.000 to say which I believe that it worked
00:21:26.640 one of them was before I started
00:21:28.679 pitching to you or anyone or like your
00:21:31.559 friends larger group I got it tested by
00:21:34.120 anant I got it tested by you I got it
00:21:35.880 tested by warun and gazel I went down
00:21:39.000 and I actually got my pitched my pitch
00:21:42.200 crafted by at least 12 or 13 Stell
00:21:44.480 Founders in the India who I know I think
00:21:46.039 that's such an incredible ins anyone
00:21:49.440 pitching so I actually like reached out
00:21:51.679 to all of them flat down sat with them
00:21:54.760 try to understand and asked everybody to
00:21:57.559 just not give me feedback actually ask
00:21:59.840 them to play Devil's Advocate I was like
00:22:02.039 just beat me down you know why do you
00:22:04.559 think this like I am coming here and I
00:22:06.559 know this will work tell me why this
00:22:08.120 will not work and because they gave me a
00:22:10.039 lot of Loops probably that helped me
00:22:11.840 that was first second I think the like
00:22:15.440 why a lot of funds were interested in
00:22:17.720 doing so first there was a growing
00:22:19.600 interest in this space where can you
00:22:22.760 build media Le Brands content Le Brands
00:22:25.360 Creator or influencer industry Le brands
00:22:28.080 was an interesting space because this
00:22:29.480 was really popping in China Korea and US
00:22:32.880 like this was there were a bunch of
00:22:33.960 companies were doing and especially when
00:22:36.120 you like different ways China has like
00:22:37.880 live Commerce and stuff Korea is more
00:22:39.840 into Beauty but different ways and
00:22:41.200 people were coming up with it sorry when
00:22:43.480 you said China's 20% online how much of
00:22:46.279 that is
00:22:47.240 streaming I don't have the number off
00:22:49.120 the top of my head but a large portion
00:22:50.600 of but I think now there's a fairly
00:22:51.880 large chunk which is% live streaming is
00:22:54.240 big big 15 20% of that will be live
00:22:56.559 streaming now I think 15 20 or 50 no I
00:22:59.840 don't think it's 50 I don't think it's
00:23:01.480 50 at least we should check the facts
00:23:03.159 but my sense is it'll be like 15 20% it
00:23:05.400 can't be so much it will not be so much
00:23:07.080 what do you think about live streaming
00:23:08.400 works why do people shop so much on live
00:23:11.279 streaming so I'll tell you I think uh
00:23:14.640 please go ahead please go ahead so I
00:23:16.480 I'll complete I'll complete the loop and
00:23:17.960 then we'll come to live live streaming
00:23:19.840 so I think there was like a growing
00:23:21.159 interest in it and the third reason why
00:23:23.400 people sort of maybe believed in what we
00:23:26.159 were doing is because is of my past
00:23:29.440 experience and the team which were
00:23:30.600 helping me doing it so my past
00:23:32.400 experience was I started doing business
00:23:35.640 and I was 16 with my father and he was a
00:23:39.360 small detergent manufacturer who used to
00:23:42.120 completely discard branding like he used
00:23:45.520 to not believe in DET interesting he was
00:23:48.159 like I want to build a great product and
00:23:49.760 if I've built a great product it'll work
00:23:51.559 so there was no marketing no sales team
00:23:53.480 no distribution no branding he's like it
00:23:55.120 just this will work I'll give it to one
00:23:56.559 man one guy and then automatic and he
00:23:58.679 was doing it for 30 years right and he
00:24:01.279 was able to do like I think when I
00:24:03.720 joined he was doing around 40 lakhs a
00:24:06.279 year in
00:24:07.799 Revenue so that was a business scale I
00:24:10.200 joined and then when I joined it and I
00:24:12.760 took over we divided the company into
00:24:14.279 two parts that one was Market
00:24:16.159 development one was product development
00:24:17.799 we learned that through
00:24:19.960 PNG so I took over the market side build
00:24:22.880 distribution went on villages to
00:24:25.480 Villages build to distribution H and
00:24:28.320 built a stellar distribution of 200
00:24:30.279 Distributors and scaled that brand like
00:24:32.799 within 18 months we were 10x of what we
00:24:34.880 were doing then another 18 months we
00:24:37.080 were like 10x of what we were doing so
00:24:38.720 it just scaled and we went on from like
00:24:40.679 a small Factory to now like four five so
00:24:43.240 what worked that was in branding and
00:24:45.559 marketing the detergent two things which
00:24:47.440 were really really different which I
00:24:49.039 believe we were doing we went to
00:24:50.880 Villages where people thought nobody
00:24:53.120 will buy premium so what we essentially
00:24:55.399 started doing our detergent was 75 rupes
00:24:57.440 a kg which was at that time tide was
00:24:59.679 doing okay uh and usually in villages
00:25:03.440 there was G and wheel which were doing
00:25:05.520 absolutely bang on which is 50 rupes and
00:25:07.320 Below 50 rupes so we went to these
00:25:09.159 villages we told them every time you're
00:25:11.600 wearing expensive clothes this is an
00:25:13.080 expensive detergent for you expensive
00:25:14.480 clothes so that clicked on in smallest
00:25:17.080 in the remot remotest of villages where
00:25:18.720 there were 10,000 population 20,000
00:25:21.039 population so I went on really deep so
00:25:23.080 from there on the demand started
00:25:24.279 beginning the second thing the second
00:25:26.240 Insight I want to really thanks sir uh
00:25:29.279 it came from Big Bazar my schooling was
00:25:31.080 done there and what I saw in big Bazar
00:25:34.320 there was my B biggest homeworks I used
00:25:35.840 to do okay after my college after my
00:25:38.799 work I used to stand in big Bazar for
00:25:40.679 like hours and for months I how old were
00:25:43.279 you I was 17 very weird kid
00:25:46.799 yeah how many kids stand in big Bazar at
00:25:49.559 17 you know I don't think it's a weird
00:25:52.039 get just I think I was so insecure that
00:25:56.000 I wanted to like get r rich or make
00:25:58.159 money so quickly that I was fine I think
00:26:01.399 I come from family where I was always an
00:26:04.279 inferior kid like to to everybody my
00:26:07.720 cousins were Toppers academically academ
00:26:11.360 then everywhere like I was not able to
00:26:13.039 speak in English properly till my till I
00:26:14.679 reached 12th so social group were like
00:26:16.960 making fun of me tell us a bit about
00:26:18.279 that where did you grow up indor so I
00:26:20.520 was in indor and school called national
00:26:22.640 public school what uh maradi family
00:26:25.399 Cindi family Cindi family Cindi family
00:26:27.120 how can you not be good at
00:26:29.799 business so I
00:26:33.600 that's no that was a learning I I saw my
00:26:36.120 father growing so I went from I actually
00:26:39.440 saw my father growing from in number if
00:26:42.559 if you want to put it in lifestyle cycle
00:26:44.080 like from one bhk to a bungalow like I
00:26:46.960 saw his first car which was a third hand
00:26:49.279 santro it happened in front of me his
00:26:51.240 first Activa happened in front of me so
00:26:52.679 I think that helped me a lot and because
00:26:54.799 I was not and I was in a school where
00:26:57.039 everybody you know typical like a indoor
00:27:00.279 tier two City where two or three of your
00:27:02.399 friends are like politicians you know
00:27:04.480 like this happens like two or three
00:27:05.799 friends are like someone someone's son
00:27:08.000 or someone's Chacha or Kaka owns like a
00:27:09.919 BMW so you always like jealous of them
00:27:12.399 so because I was like right kind of
00:27:15.000 inferior to people who had money more
00:27:16.840 power than me uh not speak able to speak
00:27:19.320 in English not like academically good so
00:27:21.440 I was like I want to prove myself I want
00:27:23.080 to go out and that's why like I used to
00:27:25.320 just find out opportunities where I can
00:27:26.720 do it and the his choice was because my
00:27:28.600 father is into it let me help him scale
00:27:31.559 because in fact I tried I applied in
00:27:35.279 like 60 70 companies fmcg companies for
00:27:37.840 internship nobody
00:27:40.399 replied so nothing worked so I stood in
00:27:43.039 big Bazar I saw something very weird
00:27:45.799 which I thought was very insightful at
00:27:47.559 that time this is 2013 14 I guess 14
00:27:50.960 probably so everybody was move this is
00:27:53.480 indor showroom uh Treasure Island
00:27:56.519 everybody was moving from solids to
00:27:58.039 liquids and that was very very killer
00:28:00.919 for me as detergent as deter no no no
00:28:03.279 everything so from bathing soaps you
00:28:06.000 were going to shower gels hand soaps to
00:28:07.880 handwash gels dishwash bars to dishwash
00:28:10.399 what year was this
00:28:12.000 201 just started just start right and
00:28:15.080 all the ads on television why so life
00:28:17.679 boy DET all they were big they were
00:28:19.399 doing only hand washes they stopped
00:28:22.200 advertising so I was like because they
00:28:24.480 are advertising liquids in big Bazar the
00:28:27.480 the biggest the biggest uh you know
00:28:29.840 display is of these these products of
00:28:31.799 these products I was like okay that's
00:28:33.200 interesting and people were buying and
00:28:34.840 this a significantly at a higher price
00:28:37.080 and people were spending less time while
00:28:38.919 choosing their liquids while then soaps
00:28:41.799 so I was
00:28:44.720 like killer killer category okay so saw
00:28:49.039 that and then at that time in big Bazar
00:28:52.240 yeah and in all kirana stores and
00:28:54.159 everywhere there used to be more at that
00:28:56.159 time as well how does one spot these
00:28:57.840 trends for somebody trying to build zero
00:28:59.600 to one so maybe I like to go on this but
00:29:03.960 anyway so I saw that and time I how my
00:29:08.480 framework was why dishwash gel I chose
00:29:11.279 and that became on one of our biggest
00:29:12.799 product dishwash gel because there was
00:29:19.760 hand I guess
00:29:24.559 right only women so there were two
00:29:27.919 products I thought there's an
00:29:29.760 opportunity because there are two
00:29:31.279 products I can do and they both were
00:29:32.559 very distinctively colored green and
00:29:34.120 yellow so I was like two different
00:29:35.600 products yellow may be opportunity green
00:29:37.120 may be opportunity let's try to do
00:29:38.720 something and did you figure this out by
00:29:40.279 sitting in a supermarket yeah in front
00:29:42.399 of kirana stores I saw that in Kiran
00:29:45.000 experiment I'll tell you something I'll
00:29:46.480 tell you why why it works is with every
00:29:49.279 transition there is something you know
00:29:51.360 every Market's dream is to increase the
00:29:53.039 per kilo or per liter price of
00:29:54.399 everything from soap to what do you call
00:29:57.320 called liquid is a increase of price and
00:29:59.240 upgrading of customers and something
00:30:01.880 comes about like modern retail came
00:30:03.519 about and they were able to sell a new
00:30:05.360 category and a new product and big Bazar
00:30:07.399 always worked on category creation so
00:30:09.080 any new categories I think we were the
00:30:11.919 player that time to create a new
00:30:13.760 category and move up the letter for the
00:30:15.360 consumers so it's a simple story of a
00:30:17.640 biscuit Pari pal is 100 rupees a kilo
00:30:21.200 and you can now go up to cookies which
00:30:23.000 is 400 rupees a kilo and go up to
00:30:25.200 chocolates which start from 1,000 rupees
00:30:26.720 a kilo so it's always upgradation I
00:30:28.760 think after liquid the tablets have come
00:30:30.279 in now correct correct why is it
00:30:32.679 dependent on how much the shipping cost
00:30:34.919 is no no no it's all about upgrading in
00:30:37.159 life everything does the same job so a
00:30:40.960 biscuit 100 rupees glucose biscuit uh
00:30:43.600 it's the vanity and the ego which you
00:30:45.279 create through marketing anding also I
00:30:48.279 believe that if you can find out a way
00:30:51.440 to make people lazy you can do a great
00:30:53.799 job like you'll be able to sell more if
00:30:56.120 you cut down the time Tak cut down the
00:30:58.159 so because so powder think of it you
00:31:00.000 open powder you have to like put up a
00:31:02.559 scoop or you don't know how much you're
00:31:04.919 putting you don't know you don't know
00:31:06.600 how to carry it I think all the brand
00:31:08.120 marketers do something called the neural
00:31:09.799 linguistic programming they condition
00:31:11.240 your brain to look at things in a
00:31:13.240 different way and accept what they are
00:31:14.960 saying M so it was like the classical
00:31:17.320 advertising of coke earlier it was
00:31:19.000 always shown on a beach and it quenches
00:31:20.919 your TST they will show a hot summer and
00:31:23.559 whenever you're drinking Coke you used
00:31:24.880 to feel that it's quenching your thirst
00:31:26.679 no but I going to say I think uh if you
00:31:28.960 if you start now I think you can be much
00:31:31.720 more I think there's a lot more data
00:31:34.000 available than there was earlier right
00:31:35.919 so I have by the way a few Brands where
00:31:38.279 the product development happens
00:31:41.120 primarily through thinking through
00:31:42.600 search so I have a brand called botanic
00:31:44.720 right you different thinking through
00:31:46.399 search yeah so what happens search on
00:31:48.320 what Google search on Google search on
00:31:50.039 Amazon search on Flipkart search on
00:31:51.840 whatever else so how do you get that
00:31:53.519 data you it's uh it's an API that you
00:31:55.559 can integrate with so Amazon allows you
00:31:56.960 to integrate and allows you to get the
00:31:58.320 data it's completely legitimate you
00:31:59.919 don't get competitor data you get cost
00:32:02.039 can somebody building a brand afford
00:32:03.519 that yes it's very inexpensive so if
00:32:06.440 you're starting now sorry I'm forgetting
00:32:08.559 the name there is third party software
00:32:10.360 which costs like in the hundreds of
00:32:13.000 rupes a month type thing right and tell
00:32:15.559 you what people are searching for in all
00:32:16.880 these it gets you what people are
00:32:18.360 searching for and that's a very good way
00:32:20.000 to sort of figure out where are the null
00:32:21.519 sets so what people look for is where
00:32:23.960 are people searching and not finding
00:32:25.320 anything M and that's what start
00:32:27.760 launching right so you know you know
00:32:30.600 we've we've launched a bunch of
00:32:32.799 interesting products right um uh you
00:32:35.559 know including vitamin C serums Etc
00:32:37.799 which are not new but they're searching
00:32:39.840 for a different format of a vitamin C
00:32:42.200 they're searching for vitamin C 50 ml
00:32:44.840 and you find that there is not that many
00:32:46.480 that are there in the 50 ml so I think
00:32:48.320 the amount of data that's available and
00:32:50.440 free and easy for anybody watching this
00:32:52.720 podcast is quite stunning and therefore
00:32:54.720 you can be much much better in my view I
00:32:56.760 don't think it takes away anything from
00:32:58.159 going and seeing right right but you can
00:32:59.919 also use this to make a better
00:33:02.639 decision this is not part of the
00:33:05.399 podcast I'm
00:33:07.240 like I I've heard so many different
00:33:09.360 stories about this podcast I don't know
00:33:11.000 which part is real and which part is
00:33:12.480 like ask you can ask it's
00:33:15.120 good you can take a walk guys I didn't
00:33:17.799 realize this do you know the number of
00:33:20.360 transacting customers online in India
00:33:23.159 how many huh how many 10 crores 100
00:33:26.080 million yeah
00:33:28.480 I was just thinking you designed it this
00:33:30.320 way he's very offline first he digital
00:33:33.159 first or social first yeah so that was a
00:33:36.039 thought process going on because this is
00:33:38.120 the combination of this is today's brand
00:33:40.080 building right I'm actually very curious
00:33:42.639 to learn about this social and commerce
00:33:46.080 yeah I know I know and
00:33:47.720 hype yeah so we were where were we why
00:33:49.919 did people invest in me yeah yeah okay H
00:33:53.000 so so the because of this background
00:33:54.919 where I was doing this two things worked
00:33:57.600 really well one was we went on Village
00:33:59.559 and village where like smallest cities
00:34:02.600 where people thought that nobody will
00:34:03.880 buy premium and we were massive
00:34:06.159 Believers that if you can sell like if
00:34:09.440 you can teach them the value of it
00:34:11.239 they'll buy obviously the volumes are
00:34:12.879 going to be less but maybe there's worth
00:34:14.639 a shot because you don't stand a chance
00:34:17.159 in front of un lier or PNG in the place
00:34:19.918 where they anywh dominate okay that was
00:34:22.599 first and second was a marketing or a
00:34:26.239 branding
00:34:27.918 how do I say framework that I still use
00:34:30.520 is we say like I believe in if I have
00:34:33.719 let's say 200 rupees I would only pick
00:34:36.719 up one person instead of trying to
00:34:38.719 promote it to 200
00:34:40.918 people people used to believe that
00:34:44.239 if right this was the basic believe in
00:34:46.879 distribution like if you're available
00:34:48.239 you can you can sell so how do I get my
00:34:51.359 brand seen
00:34:52.679 more so the first thing is do I have
00:34:55.560 enough money to get seen do I have
00:34:57.520 enough marketing brain to get seen do I
00:34:59.359 have enough so none of us is that I was
00:35:01.520 like okay let's compare me versus whim
00:35:03.880 because whim was our biggest competitor
00:35:05.640 in dishwash
00:35:06.880 gels so Wim has more money than me to
00:35:10.839 advertise in India yes Wim has more
00:35:13.160 money than me to advertise in my state
00:35:15.200 yes whm has more money to advertise than
00:35:17.520 me in my city yes but does he have more
00:35:19.960 money to Market to these 10 houses in my
00:35:23.960 Colony probably not because if if I have
00:35:27.240 only 10,000 rupees and if I'm only
00:35:29.320 promoting in one Colony I'll be seen in
00:35:32.040 that entire Colony versus MNC brand is
00:35:35.280 that an important Insight if you're
00:35:36.760 starting a fresh yeah micro geography so
00:35:41.000 in distribution and like physical
00:35:42.680 distribution this worked well because my
00:35:44.800 whole Colony started believing that
00:35:47.240 oh because in the beginning in
00:35:49.680 distribution people so here's what I
00:35:52.040 believe like you know there's a journey
00:35:53.480 which a customer goes through convers uh
00:35:56.400 convers ation convincing and conversion
00:35:59.760 okay so first is a customer ask himself
00:36:02.240 or herself they converse with themselves
00:36:08.599 that is it happening everywhere so
00:36:10.599 that's a conversation going on there's
00:36:12.079 something right then second is
00:36:13.680 convincing the convincing is you talk to
00:36:16.599 your friends you see someone else Buy
00:36:18.440 sell buying it or maybe in distribution
00:36:21.280 lad India with where the physical
00:36:22.839 distribution happens the shopkeeper is a
00:36:24.560 key influencer to convince you he's like
00:36:26.319 Bobby G
00:36:27.319 and the shopkeeper said it bab will take
00:36:30.280 it you will take it B will take it how
00:36:32.480 do you convince the shopkeeper margins
00:36:34.640 and I'll come to that it's all incentive
00:36:37.520 driven though I think but your point if
00:36:39.240 you start something new my sense is I
00:36:40.760 think being a shark in a pond is always
00:36:44.160 better than doing something else I don't
00:36:45.880 know whether that's distribution or a
00:36:47.200 niche right if you want to launch an
00:36:49.000 ethnic I wouldn't go against the big
00:36:51.319 guys so you're saying when you're
00:36:52.640 beginning when you're beginning be big
00:36:54.359 fish small pond not small fish in the
00:36:56.040 sea I think so I mean my my read right
00:36:59.800 no I would uh I would obviously that is
00:37:02.280 correct but I would come into a I will
00:37:04.119 come into the market by another
00:37:06.240 route so that's what they have done in a
00:37:08.480 way so you will find a nation enter into
00:37:11.079 the market by a different way that's it
00:37:13.240 so that's the second thing which worked
00:37:14.920 for us because we used no parking boats
00:37:17.960 digital boats posters just in one area
00:37:20.480 so it looked like no parking boats so in
00:37:23.880 in tier two tier three cities there's a
00:37:25.760 No Parking boat
00:37:27.119 which people put on their Bungalows
00:37:28.640 adver to advertise you put in no parking
00:37:31.040 and then up and on up and down of that
00:37:33.240 you have your you have your advertis so
00:37:34.800 we used all of that right then we what
00:37:37.119 we started doing is we St we stood on a
00:37:39.800 transporting place where we like because
00:37:42.520 we wanted to expand out of our city
00:37:44.280 indor so we said this these transport
00:37:48.079 guysa whatever your Raa the loading
00:37:51.240 guard is I'm going to repair it okay
00:37:54.359 I'll repair it for you the the from just
00:37:57.280 from the Aesthetics of it so the
00:37:59.079 Aesthetics in repairment would take us
00:38:00.680 like 1,000 2,000 3,000 bucks but then in
00:38:03.319 exchange I would paint my paint your
00:38:05.000 whole Rika into jadugar so I got like
00:38:08.040 thousands of these rias who would roam
00:38:10.160 around the entire State and then there
00:38:12.160 was a number and people started calling
00:38:13.520 me right so this is what we did we went
00:38:15.480 really really narrow say people who do
00:38:17.839 not consider real estate and considering
00:38:20.880 autoa real estate if they don't consider
00:38:23.680 it a asset today you can convince them
00:38:26.160 to and your product and make it an asset
00:38:29.000 so that's what happened and then so I
00:38:31.839 did that then I left all of it so I left
00:38:36.960 uh 3 months I was still in home I
00:38:38.480 started creating
00:38:39.720 content at home indor in indor and in 3
00:38:43.280 months I scaled from I had like 50,000
00:38:45.680 followers already to I scaled from 50 to
00:38:47.240 300K because I learned patterns of
00:38:49.720 around top 100 brands in the world what
00:38:51.640 they were doing right learned that
00:38:53.680 pattern started creating content reach
00:38:55.240 300K m got my first brand deal came to
00:38:58.520 Bombay and is there also a learning
00:39:00.640 there for family
00:39:02.560 businesses yeah I mean from day one set
00:39:05.200 expectations right I don't or probably
00:39:09.119 the second wh would be if I was
00:39:12.000 convincing enough probably or I would
00:39:14.119 have stayed enough then things would
00:39:16.040 have gotten sorted so yeah coming like
00:39:17.880 cutting this story so I left came to
00:39:19.599 Bombay started hustling again and there
00:39:22.079 was time where the first money which I
00:39:24.599 got from Brand I put it in like Advanced
00:39:26.240 rent of three months and I was I had
00:39:28.319 like a good house but I didn't have
00:39:29.920 furniture so I was sleeping on floor for
00:39:31.880 a month because I was like brand explain
00:39:34.839 brand new guy has 300,000 followers on
00:39:38.280 social media moves to Bombay how much
00:39:40.960 does a brand pay okay so I I'll tell you
00:39:44.000 brand names and who paid me the first
00:39:45.480 brand deal was ever 70,000 rupees from
00:39:47.400 upgrad that was upfront they paid me
00:39:50.440 they were like put up a story tell our
00:39:52.119 courses are there in digital marketing
00:39:53.520 and content do they paid 70,000 rupees
00:39:56.640 uh that 70,000 gave me money to come to
00:39:58.440 Bombay then while in 10 days I was
00:40:00.640 living in a hotel during those 10 days I
00:40:03.440 got a deal from Ki buers pink insurance
00:40:06.359 and Amazon sellers how I got this I
00:40:09.640 started dming them on Instagram and
00:40:11.599 asked them that hey I can do this this
00:40:13.040 this this started telling them concepts
00:40:14.520 of what I can do with them together
00:40:16.960 these three brands paid me around n
00:40:18.960 lakhs wow that n lakh became my
00:40:21.040 six-month runway in Bombay and they paid
00:40:23.720 you nine for how many sort of like for a
00:40:26.079 long engagement so two to post each and
00:40:29.960 then rights I sold my so I sold my
00:40:32.880 rights to one of these Brands I don't
00:40:34.160 remember which one for 6 months to
00:40:35.960 advertise on my face so that I learned
00:40:40.000 and then it was all cold dming once I
00:40:42.440 did that and then once you start popping
00:40:44.240 up automatically you start doing it one
00:40:46.400 quick lesson if you want to put it out
00:40:47.760 everybody whoever is creating content
00:40:50.160 reach out to B2B Brands more than d2c
00:40:53.480 Brands and I'll tell you why right
00:40:56.040 because platforms when you say B2B B2B
00:40:58.160 is like let's say Amazon or adobe or
00:41:00.480 Google or meta WhatsApp right they pay
00:41:02.960 you way a lot money D Toc brands have no
00:41:05.160 money is that how it works you reach out
00:41:07.000 to Brands not wait for them to come to
00:41:08.599 you now they come to us and still
00:41:10.480 there's a like mix of inbound and
00:41:11.839 outbound in the beginning I used to do
00:41:13.640 the outbound and why B2B Brands work
00:41:16.720 better
00:41:18.160 because there's no one literally
00:41:20.000 promoting them so if you can align your
00:41:23.200 content with what Adobe wants to promote
00:41:25.319 like how would you promote adob
00:41:27.000 right so if you can align your content
00:41:28.520 with that there's a higher chance that
00:41:29.839 you'll get paid versus a d2c brand d2c
00:41:32.200 thinks of performance yeah d2c thinks
00:41:36.359 like Adobe can't do that with you so the
00:41:39.520 influencer medium might be influencing a
00:41:42.640 lot in sales but we'll never truly know
00:41:44.760 because it might not translate into
00:41:46.520 direct exactly that's right that's right
00:41:48.599 I think that's a problem even now I
00:41:50.280 think for everybody who uses influencers
00:41:52.200 right attributability but it's still
00:41:54.000 better than what advertising we used to
00:41:55.920 do that is no doubt at all no so yeah
00:41:59.359 that's the the content I did and then I
00:42:02.480 built I learned few patterns grew from
00:42:05.359 zero to now in 2 years 400 million views
00:42:07.480 a year uh wow give us the top four
00:42:10.240 patterns you learned because that again
00:42:11.960 is something so many people want to okay
00:42:14.800 emulate uh number one there's a format
00:42:18.000 that I follow which is called ECG so do
00:42:21.480 you create five pieces of content which
00:42:23.040 is Evergreen y so that people which is
00:42:25.640 relevant something yesterday it's going
00:42:26.960 to relevant today and that's going to
00:42:28.119 relevant tomorrow so what this going to
00:42:29.880 do is keep your audience
00:42:31.680 engaged topic Okay C is controversial
00:42:35.960 okay so I create three pieces of content
00:42:37.400 which are controversial which are going
00:42:38.440 to reach to masses so that even if it's
00:42:41.319 my Niche I'm going to talk about
00:42:42.599 controversial stuff so let's say even if
00:42:44.440 it's business I'm going to talk about
00:42:45.960 the businesses which tank the things
00:42:47.440 which are going down all of that stuff
00:42:49.000 because that will get me so many views
00:42:50.359 and new audience and then two pieces of
00:42:53.040 content are growth so growth is only
00:42:55.160 growing my core community community so I
00:42:57.359 believe so our why of what we do is to
00:43:00.200 create more leaders and help them become
00:43:02.000 personal Brands so I really love because
00:43:04.359 personal brand has shaped me into who I
00:43:05.760 am so like I want to do that so I create
00:43:08.359 two pieces of content for that Community
00:43:09.920 to help them grow because these are the
00:43:12.119 people who are going to actually become
00:43:15.040 your promoters and this is 53 and two
00:43:17.640 every month 53 and two I do depending on
00:43:20.440 like it can be a month it can be a week
00:43:22.839 it can be whatever I create a Content
00:43:24.319 every day and and does does that help
00:43:26.520 the frequency helps like no there's
00:43:28.760 nothing related to frequency see at the
00:43:30.599 end of the day what you really want to
00:43:32.720 do is there's another one thing quick
00:43:34.480 hack is respect the platform if you want
00:43:37.200 platform to respect you for example you
00:43:40.000 read annual reports and annual
00:43:42.599 announcements of these platforms y Okay
00:43:44.640 Google Facebook what are they focusing
00:43:46.680 on so Facebook will automatically say
00:43:49.280 hey this
00:43:50.960 year we going to promote short content
00:43:53.319 so you know that you're not going to
00:43:54.520 talk about anything else t
00:43:56.680 talked about that we want to increase
00:43:58.920 people's uh average duration per user so
00:44:03.680 it means that the threads will work
00:44:05.800 because how will you do it LinkedIn said
00:44:07.800 that he want to make LinkedIn a fun
00:44:09.920 workplace to be you say threads will
00:44:12.240 work if you write a long tweet that that
00:44:14.599 was I'm telling at that time when I did
00:44:16.119 I don't know what's going right now and
00:44:17.839 what did you say for Instagram Instagram
00:44:19.760 Instagram want to Pro short short
00:44:21.319 content this I when I started I was do
00:44:23.520 this and then LinkedIn said that we want
00:44:26.280 make fun environment workplace to do it
00:44:28.200 fun means everybody was doing text can I
00:44:30.240 do videos Dums and very interesting
00:44:33.880 inside right so whatever the platform
00:44:35.960 wants to promote if you are if your
00:44:38.520 interest are aligned with that they'll
00:44:40.480 push you way faster than anyone else so
00:44:42.720 that was a second thing which I did and
00:44:44.480 then bunch of things the third and the
00:44:46.480 most important thing which I believe
00:44:48.520 people do wrong in
00:44:50.200 Social is they try to make branded
00:44:55.440 content
00:44:56.680 performance content and sharable content
00:44:59.400 together and it's a losing strategy so
00:45:02.640 look at Brands right they would promote
00:45:04.640 these are the five things that we stand
00:45:06.599 for who the
00:45:08.880 yeah like we don't right that if you
00:45:11.440 want to do it do it in like phases like
00:45:14.040 once in a while you're talking about
00:45:15.040 values once in a while you're doing it
00:45:16.440 right now the only thing if you want to
00:45:18.920 grow you should think about how can you
00:45:20.520 make people share more or save more
00:45:22.839 nothing else
00:45:24.040 matters nothing else matters M yeah the
00:45:27.040 engagement likes don't matter views
00:45:29.400 don't
00:45:30.240 matter shares and saves and how do you
00:45:32.720 get people to share so there are
00:45:35.359 different tricks you do it right based
00:45:37.079 on content one of the basic contents is
00:45:39.680 if you're an educational content right
00:45:41.960 pick up your target audience either you
00:45:44.480 attack your target audience or you make
00:45:46.720 them feel smart or you attack them you
00:45:49.680 break their belief system so you'll get
00:45:51.480 polarizing audience but the half of the
00:45:53.480 polarizing audience they share every
00:45:56.480 interesting uh one thing which you can
00:45:58.359 do you can play on
00:45:59.559 relationships right you can take one
00:46:01.640 side of a relationship and make a
00:46:03.720 Content let's say for every girlfriend
00:46:05.440 to share it with the boyfriends every
00:46:07.480 boyfriend to share it with their fathers
00:46:10.599 right like just so you play on that so
00:46:13.280 there are multiple ways you can do it so
00:46:14.880 there's you you just think about how you
00:46:17.480 can make your content share because
00:46:20.599 that's all matters this is incredibly
00:46:23.480 useful everybody starting a brand from 0
00:46:26.160 to one in today's world also has to
00:46:28.680 build a social media following yeah it's
00:46:30.960 a big Advantage right their own
00:46:32.640 distribution sharing and saving sharing
00:46:34.680 and and
00:46:36.800 dcg no very useful yeah very helpful
00:46:39.839 very valuable very valuable kishor
00:46:42.160 everybody knows already uh he's been
00:46:44.880 here and he's like the original rockar
00:46:47.800 of this particular
00:46:50.480 podcast uh would you like to tell
00:46:53.000 us uh what have you been doing since
00:46:56.960 March and any insights you're seeing in
00:47:00.079 the market since then are you seeing
00:47:01.760 that drop in consumption I was talking
00:47:03.559 about
00:47:05.160 earlier yes we uh we have talking to a
00:47:09.000 lot of people and but I think this year
00:47:11.960 is a what you call adik Mass the Diwali
00:47:15.359 is one month later later correct is one
00:47:18.160 month ahead yeah and unfortunately every
00:47:20.359 marketer follows the calendar month and
00:47:23.200 that's a serious issue in India you
00:47:25.040 should follow the
00:47:26.599 the festival calendar correct correct
00:47:28.800 correct and that's so that's why I think
00:47:31.160 there will be a little bit of mismatch
00:47:33.240 secondly I think inflation might be
00:47:35.000 playing a little bit here and there do
00:47:38.079 you think interest rates have gone to
00:47:39.559 that point where they have started
00:47:41.280 seriously hitting consumption I think
00:47:43.720 the data of fmcg which came in for
00:47:46.839 August was quite disappointing was
00:47:49.440 disappointing it was showing 11 month
00:47:52.040 11% lower than last month and even uh
00:47:54.359 year to year it was around 1230 % I
00:47:56.720 think that metric is true across the
00:47:58.800 board me and Anan were at a dinner and I
00:48:01.319 was asking one payment Gateway guy one
00:48:03.800 electric vehicle guy I was asking Anand
00:48:06.040 in
00:48:07.240 fashion everybody offline seems to be
00:48:09.960 saying consumption has fallen off in the
00:48:12.480 last two months I don't know how
00:48:14.240 accurate these numbers are but Amazon
00:48:16.680 India grew by just about 5% this year
00:48:19.960 flip cart 7 8% based on higher end
00:48:24.000 electronics and premiumization which
00:48:25.880 seems to be growing but everything seems
00:48:28.599 to be slowing down uh and I was trying
00:48:31.920 to figure out is that it like festivals
00:48:34.000 is there some festivals in interest rate
00:48:36.280 I always believe there are multiple
00:48:37.359 reasons for anything to happen there
00:48:39.599 like fire elements make the planet I
00:48:41.200 think there are multiple Elements which
00:48:42.480 creates the market or makes the market
00:48:44.800 go lower so there are multiple I think
00:48:46.400 interest rate is one of the things
00:48:48.079 festival calendar is another thing
00:48:50.440 thirdly there is a there was a little
00:48:52.440 bit of a fatigue also because after coid
00:48:55.200 the came about and then the fatigue
00:48:57.359 Factor also set in I personally believe
00:49:00.160 uh the inflation has played the I think
00:49:04.559 we are getting formalized as the economy
00:49:06.280 and formal economy is more expensive
00:49:08.119 than a informal economy I think that's
00:49:10.720 playing around a little bit for the
00:49:12.559 first time the formalization is quite
00:49:14.200 complete now yeah and that is that means
00:49:17.760 18%
00:49:19.079 extra and I think that's a big that's a
00:49:22.040 big is that a big hit this GST component
00:49:25.720 consum it is for Consumer it is consumer
00:49:27.680 it is for one segment of the population
00:49:29.559 maybe not but for the rest of the
00:49:31.160 segment of the population it's how much
00:49:33.480 do you think in India in terms of trade
00:49:35.400 happens offline and how much happens
00:49:37.400 with
00:49:38.079 GST I think the formalization is quite
00:49:40.440 there now I think almost there yeah I
00:49:42.200 don't I think there'll be very few
00:49:43.440 leakages so I mean I just wanted to add
00:49:45.720 I I think by the way on the consumption
00:49:47.760 I'll cover a little bit of the online
00:49:49.200 just my sense by the way is you really
00:49:52.839 accelerated the online adoption and
00:49:55.040 increased consumption for those 12 14 18
00:49:57.200 months during coid right I think now
00:49:59.240 stabilizing again right so what he's
00:50:01.839 talking even offline is showing offline
00:50:03.880 by the way I think two thoughts that I
00:50:05.680 have I think your point on inflation I
00:50:07.359 think is absolutely true the other is I
00:50:10.119 mean if you do really compress the
00:50:11.520 season it it it's no I have I have
00:50:15.200 another story also to talk about here
00:50:17.599 yeah which will be interesting I I think
00:50:19.400 there are a consumer has a budget I
00:50:22.599 remember a time when mobile phone was
00:50:24.319 just launched and every mobile became a
00:50:27.960 item of fashion and which used to change
00:50:31.119 every six months yeah and that time the
00:50:33.240 money the budget of the the consumer
00:50:35.119 went away from Fashion to mobile phone
00:50:37.160 correct so there are so many new
00:50:38.559 interest which has developed no and also
00:50:40.400 for example Travelers come back I think
00:50:42.559 India consumption in my mind people are
00:50:44.160 spending on experiences in fact even
00:50:46.240 this year I was reading a stat that live
00:50:48.319 shows live concerts and
00:50:50.839 the really fast yeah so what what fmcg
00:50:55.160 product would you add in the experience
00:50:56.960 category I not experience but look at
00:50:59.119 the restaurants business a lot of new
00:51:00.680 restaurant lot of new experien is coming
00:51:02.240 up and everything is getting uh adopted
00:51:04.599 in a way so there are new categories
00:51:07.400 which are emerging I think Health as a
00:51:09.280 focus has been interesting I mean you
00:51:10.880 know for us one interesting thing is we
00:51:13.119 have a peanut butter brand called my
00:51:14.520 fitness I mean I didn't think that
00:51:16.720 peanut butter was that large a category
00:51:19.760 but it's growing like crazy because
00:51:21.079 what's happening is people actually want
00:51:22.599 to the mother feeding the jam sandwich
00:51:26.160 is now saying I want to do something
00:51:27.400 healthier for the child the vegetarian
00:51:29.760 who's working out by the way wants to
00:51:31.760 sort of have some protein so it's
00:51:33.520 interesting so there's consumption
00:51:34.599 shifting into more healthy eating for
00:51:37.040 example right and that by the way
00:51:38.640 there's no growth slowdown right so I
00:51:40.520 think your point of budget getting
00:51:42.119 resplit into various other parts of
00:51:44.319 consumption I think is probably one of
00:51:47.200 the biggest reasons also there yeah any
00:51:49.280 other Trends you're noticing in the last
00:51:50.880 3 four months the trend which is
00:51:53.839 definitely emerging or which is being
00:51:55.079 disc discussed is how lot of new digital
00:51:57.880 brands are shaping up mhm and uh there's
00:52:01.440 a new story which everybody is coming
00:52:03.440 out with and uh story is building that
00:52:05.760 brand yeah so that's what something
00:52:07.760 which we are observing and we believe
00:52:10.559 that's another opportunity because it's
00:52:12.119 catering to one segment of the
00:52:13.760 population and that population has lot
00:52:16.480 of disposable income and they are
00:52:18.160 experimenting with lots and lots of
00:52:19.799 things
00:52:20.640 yeah so me and Kish were on a call
00:52:23.200 recently he was sharing his insight
00:52:26.079 on can I say demographic geographical
00:52:29.400 insights yeah should we go through that
00:52:32.359 entire thing just so that people can
00:52:33.799 learn from it no I was presenting
00:52:35.720 something which was saying that uh that
00:52:38.920 30 30 30 million what call three CR
00:52:42.559 households in this country okay are
00:52:45.680 basically contributing to 60% of India's
00:52:48.599 consumption and uh I was talking about
00:52:51.520 value added consumption and in terms of
00:52:53.400 value and within that CR or 30 million
00:52:57.240 families y there is a Singapore which is
00:53:00.640 let's say 60 lakh people they're exactly
00:53:02.680 consuming like that we are behaving like
00:53:04.559 that yeah then there is a Poland which
00:53:07.119 is another two and a half three CR
00:53:08.720 people interesting very similar GDP
00:53:11.520 similar per capita and then there is
00:53:13.880 Mexico which is around 78 CR people you
00:53:17.200 want to talk about India 1 India 2 the
00:53:19.839 distinction no that theory we did speak
00:53:22.559 about last time also and uh but I think
00:53:25.000 this you've gone like a little bit in
00:53:26.559 depth right yeah we've gone quite a lot
00:53:28.280 in depth and I believe uh that the rest
00:53:30.920 of India which is the balance India
00:53:34.440 which is Singapore Poland and Mexico
00:53:36.839 they are like subsaharan numbers 1100
00:53:39.400 per capita yeah and uh and the valued
00:53:42.960 consumption we don't see valued
00:53:44.559 consumption in this large group which is
00:53:47.400 nearly
00:53:48.400 13 million people 1.3 million so so the
00:53:52.960 consumption which is happening which is
00:53:54.160 value added and a much smaller group
00:53:56.160 it's a much smaller group maybe around
00:53:58.000 10 12 CR people Y and this 10 12 CR
00:54:01.200 people can be represented as what I say
00:54:02.880 India one India one is anybody who has
00:54:04.440 domestic help they don't do some
00:54:06.960 interesting things on their own and then
00:54:08.920 there is India 2 which helps you to lead
00:54:10.680 a better life the drivers the helpers
00:54:12.319 the pr the maids The Watchmen the
00:54:14.440 liftman and they are huge in numbers for
00:54:16.400 every one India one there are three
00:54:17.680 three and a half India twos and then
00:54:19.799 there is India 3 which is the farm
00:54:21.520 laborers they make their ends meet and
00:54:23.599 they are on government Aid so where will
00:54:25.839 the consumption ultimately happen and
00:54:28.160 where will the value added consumption
00:54:29.520 happen because the economy has to grow
00:54:30.880 the value added consumption has to grow
00:54:32.960 and India has been created in a
00:54:34.760 different our societies have been built
00:54:36.160 in a very different way where in the
00:54:38.240 consumption is more by people who have
00:54:42.839 reached somewhere M and we don't give
00:54:45.760 enough money to India to to make them
00:54:48.599 but is India one growing quite fast it's
00:54:50.960 not growing so fast okay which is
00:54:53.240 growing fastest India one two or three
00:54:57.119 I think uh it's I would say India one is
00:55:00.839 only growing maybe maybe a percentage a
00:55:03.559 year maybe less than that in terms of
00:55:05.359 consumption no 1% adding up to that that
00:55:08.280 four and India too India to is growing
00:55:11.280 because India 3 is people coming to
00:55:12.599 India 2 always they're the larger Chunk
00:55:14.240 in any case so you're seeing the middle
00:55:16.720 class is getting bigger I don't know
00:55:18.760 middle class is defined by income groups
00:55:20.720 and all in India income groups don't uh
00:55:22.960 you know can I add something on India
00:55:24.559 one India India 3 because I've been
00:55:25.960 spending a lot of time on that because I
00:55:27.720 read it and it happened in India before
00:55:30.480 right I I still stick to that yeah so I
00:55:34.280 believe like India 1 India 2 India 3
00:55:36.160 definitely has to do a lot with income
00:55:38.359 but it also has to do with awareness and
00:55:41.200 choices so I'll give you an example
00:55:43.920 India one India 2 India 3 just just like
00:55:46.599 you know divide put them for lack of
00:55:48.319 better customer One customer two
00:55:49.640 customer three they all exist in same
00:55:51.760 house with same income group as well and
00:55:54.359 I'll tell you why okay explain same how
00:55:56.920 same income so I I'll give you let's say
00:55:58.640 me my brother my father okay my father
00:56:01.720 would use one
00:56:05.599 soap he'll do one product right he's
00:56:08.319 using less products just 50 to 200
00:56:10.200 product y I would do a face wash a
00:56:13.440 shampoo and a body wash my brother would
00:56:16.319 do a shampoo a conditioner a face wash a
00:56:18.640 scrub or like the 10 things right right
00:56:20.880 so he's India one who's using like
00:56:22.799 10,000 product all you all three are
00:56:24.520 India one
00:56:25.480 yeah so no I'm saying that customer One
00:56:29.039 customer 2 customer 3 like comparatively
00:56:31.599 my father would use only 25 to 30
00:56:33.359 products around it yeah he's consuming
00:56:35.559 less number of items or skus as we call
00:56:37.400 it yeah so that's exactly but ultimately
00:56:40.160 you'll come in that same family of India
00:56:41.520 one no but Kish your point is by the way
00:56:43.480 there is call it U see I think one is
00:56:46.160 the number of customers which is you're
00:56:47.599 saying call it 100 110 120 million
00:56:50.520 roughly right that's what you're saying
00:56:52.720 if you assume four four people per
00:56:54.359 family 120 million roughly so the second
00:56:56.960 by the way is maybe the number let's
00:56:59.480 just take that number for a minute the
00:57:01.359 consumption of those 100 122 million I
00:57:03.839 think the point Raj is trying to make is
00:57:05.200 it continues to increase yes yeah it is
00:57:07.000 increasing there's no
00:57:08.400 debate very low percentage but that no
00:57:10.680 that consumption of this 12 CR people is
00:57:12.640 close to 800 billion
00:57:15.240 plus no I feel people who have is that
00:57:17.680 number going up the
00:57:20.200 consumption that's going up for this
00:57:22.520 India one the consumption is going up
00:57:24.400 but then why are not reflecting in say
00:57:26.240 Amazon flipart it's reflecting no but uh
00:57:29.000 see I don't think you can take one
00:57:30.240 quarter worth of data and generalize
00:57:32.400 this alone I mean and you can't yeah how
00:57:34.960 much do you think it's going up by
00:57:36.400 percentage wise you said 800 billion I I
00:57:39.079 think it's growing a lot on this India W
00:57:41.599 you say upward of 20 30% maybe an excess
00:57:44.640 of 10% for sure do you think it's
00:57:46.359 growing because of increasing
00:57:49.000 consumption or premiumization is the
00:57:51.480 volume growing or is the it's price
00:57:54.000 point GR discretionary income and uh
00:57:56.720 they have Surplus incomes and they have
00:57:58.400 to spend that money like in his family
00:58:00.200 like the next generation is consuming
00:58:02.119 more than the previous generation and it
00:58:04.960 is both I think for sure there's
00:58:06.440 premiumization but I also think people
00:58:08.200 buy more things yeah yeah yeah right I
00:58:10.799 mean you just end up buying more things
00:58:12.920 right we did some analysis we did some
00:58:15.440 analysis an was India one consumes close
00:58:18.880 to 100,000 items in their lifetime MH
00:58:23.319 India 2 is maybe 10 ,000 in India 3 is,
00:58:27.599 and would you like to list the top items
00:58:29.599 I know you have it in your research
00:58:31.880 where does India one spend the most
00:58:33.400 money I think I think there lifestyle
00:58:36.520 food but I think the look at the kind of
00:58:38.480 food is which is getting consumed today
00:58:40.760 by India one I would say the Singapore
00:58:42.319 and the Poland side I think they have
00:58:44.359 prized to a great great extent from
00:58:46.160 asparagas to avocados to health food
00:58:48.880 everybody is consuming every family
00:58:50.400 member is consuming a different kind of
00:58:51.839 breakfast and different kind of
00:58:53.720 food I think going out again by India
00:58:56.960 one which is Poland and Singapore is
00:58:58.520 significant even Mexico in a way so how
00:59:01.920 would you categorize income ranges of
00:59:03.720 Singapore Poland you know Singapore
00:59:05.520 would be I would
00:59:07.680 say more than uh a Family household
00:59:10.680 income of 30 40 lakhs plus and what
00:59:14.200 percentage of that will be a small I
00:59:17.039 would say no this will be around 60 lakh
00:59:18.680 plus yeah and I mean Singapore income
00:59:21.960 will be closer to 100 120k I mean so
00:59:25.119 it's it's you are closer to like a yeah
00:59:27.480 90 lakhs 90 laks CR but and the Poland
00:59:31.119 would be in excess of 2025 LS and Mexico
00:59:34.960 would be much little lesser than that
00:59:37.240 yes maybe around 12 laks 125 majority of
00:59:40.920 India one is in Mexico right majority is
00:59:43.319 in Mexico around 8 crores another
00:59:45.720 research which we found out was the
00:59:47.200 total package good consumption in India
00:59:49.200 atcg package good in value terms is 70%
00:59:52.960 of exess is by this India one M beauty
00:59:56.160 close to 85% yeah and uh eating out in
01:00:01.520 restaurants close to 78% so it's
01:00:03.720 significant in high 50s 60 fruits 65 70%
01:00:07.680 yeah yeah but I I would say going back
01:00:09.920 to you know you talking about brand
01:00:11.079 building right I mean 120 million is
01:00:13.160 still a very large number a huge number
01:00:15.200 right still but I'm guessing for anyone
01:00:18.200 planning to build a Brand 0 to one has
01:00:20.960 to focus on that 120 million yeah I
01:00:23.960 think on a much narrower piece you want
01:00:26.319 a margin of more than 40 to 60% correct
01:00:28.559 correct correct I have yeah I have I've
01:00:31.240 now met some 800 900 of these Founders
01:00:33.599 right 832 I think is the exact number
01:00:35.960 but um I think there's a clear pattern
01:00:38.400 on what works and what doesn't work for
01:00:39.760 the first 20 crores of are there any
01:00:41.240 other insights here like out of this 120
01:00:43.640 million how many of them prefer paying
01:00:46.319 through UPI credit card cash what
01:00:50.000 percentage may be online versus offline
01:00:52.880 this 100 million will all be online also
01:00:55.280 online I I think my sense is by the way
01:00:57.160 they may not do all their purchases
01:00:58.400 online but they will 100% be online they
01:01:00.280 would have experienced online definitely
01:01:01.480 they would have experienced online
01:01:02.400 definitely so they have a credit card or
01:01:03.760 UPI 100% would be by more likely UPI
01:01:06.720 than cred UPI more than credit credit
01:01:08.720 card also three CR users three and half
01:01:10.240 CR users in this country so they will
01:01:11.839 all come here and are these users this
01:01:15.000 120 concentrated in between the
01:01:17.799 metropolitan cities oh no I would say
01:01:19.680 the top 100 cities significantly
01:01:22.400 significant top 100 right not Metro I
01:01:24.280 mean like very large as a spread how how
01:01:27.319 much do you think will be in the Metros
01:01:29.240 cuz I'm trying to think of someone buing
01:01:30.720 60% plus so if
01:01:33.359 you open 10 stores have a online thing
01:01:36.839 distribution in 10 cities you cater to
01:01:39.200 60% of the 120 million yeah for the
01:01:42.480 value added consumption where the
01:01:44.799 margins are higher explain what is value
01:01:47.119 value value added is how much value you
01:01:48.839 adding if you are creating buying a
01:01:51.119 buying a product or making a product at
01:01:52.680 one rupee at what multiple you are are
01:01:54.520 selling it it has to be an excess of
01:01:56.000 three times that Val of creating a brand
01:01:59.400 yeah then you are creating a brand by
01:02:01.000 the way one slight thing on the same
01:02:02.520 topic I think I it was quite interesting
01:02:04.839 for me if you take the top 100 cities at
01:02:06.520 least in the e-commerce world the
01:02:09.240 outside Metro cities I don't know the
01:02:11.599 exact split is growing much much faster
01:02:13.319 but it will be growing but you have to
01:02:14.480 see the value of the merchandise which
01:02:16.720 you are
01:02:18.079 selling I believe India is all about per
01:02:20.680 kilo realization whether it's a garment
01:02:22.599 whether it's a towel whether it's a mg
01:02:24.760 product or whether it's a detergent it's
01:02:26.760 a per killo realization of something and
01:02:29.079 where where you can reach yeah no the
01:02:31.400 reason I'm saying is when we launched I
01:02:33.400 mean at least in mintra when you launch
01:02:34.680 premium products was quite interesting
01:02:36.839 Always by the way the places that didn't
01:02:38.520 have the malls but in the top 100 cities
01:02:40.279 would sell the most I mean Polo Ral
01:02:42.200 Lauren when we launched would sell in
01:02:44.359 like Nell and CH yeah but it would sell
01:02:47.000 but how many people from that City
01:02:49.079 actually if you add up all of them all
01:02:51.760 the cities put together but add up for a
01:02:53.240 particular City there is a store in
01:02:55.240 Bombay Ares so which the most popular
01:02:58.119 brand of the world 60 people account for
01:03:01.400 80% of the business and that's among the
01:03:03.480 top few stores of hers in the world how
01:03:05.960 much do account for and they're
01:03:07.720 typically Bombay based they are I don't
01:03:10.039 know I don't buy anything from them no
01:03:12.279 so I'll tell you what in the last
01:03:13.480 yourself or for friends like I'll tell
01:03:16.079 you in the last 3 four years yeah I've
01:03:19.160 completely stopped buying from Ultra
01:03:21.960 Luxury Brands like heres and LV and all
01:03:24.680 that because I feel they play you their
01:03:28.079 entire marketing strategy seems to be to
01:03:31.520 offend and get some kind of a reaction
01:03:35.359 out of you and then buy from them like
01:03:37.119 you know they'll tell you n has Achi
01:03:40.559 Nana no more of the you you know that is
01:03:45.720 that is the most offensive thing like to
01:03:47.640 go to a shop where they're marking up a
01:03:50.079 product one is to A Thousand Times yeah
01:03:52.200 yeah and then saying you can't buy this
01:03:54.480 product until you build a relationship
01:03:56.839 with us get on a list do all of these
01:03:59.839 hoops that you have to jump through it's
01:04:02.359 not because they can't manufacture more
01:04:03.960 of that they can go make a million of
01:04:05.799 those bags and stuff but that strategy
01:04:08.559 of being arrogant has worked so well for
01:04:11.680 them that I think people have to be
01:04:13.720 cognizant to that and you know kind of
01:04:15.559 like so nikel in early days like big
01:04:18.520 Bazar was created on three things greed
01:04:21.480 fear and uh we used to call it uh
01:04:25.640 altruism to a certain extent the brand
01:04:27.279 can be built on this greed is that it is
01:04:30.000 available at a lower price fear is that
01:04:31.720 it won't be available after a while yeah
01:04:34.240 yeah and secondly all the brands are
01:04:36.160 built on appealing to your ego and
01:04:38.480 vanity how does big Bazar do it for
01:04:41.520 example like a budget Supermarket
01:04:44.400 distinguish themselves from a Hermes or
01:04:47.760 Herms or however you call it like what
01:04:50.279 is the differentiation what part of ego
01:04:52.160 are you going after and what are and
01:04:54.279 fear and they are going after your ego
01:04:56.720 and vanity yeah I think all fancy
01:04:59.599 shopping is based on manipulation I feel
01:05:03.839 when you go buy a BMW for example it has
01:05:07.319 very little to do with how the car truly
01:05:10.359 feels but it is the perception
01:05:12.680 subconsciously sold to you that a
01:05:15.000 certain kind of person drives this kind
01:05:17.200 of a car of of course because in
01:05:19.680 isolation if we were not to be social
01:05:21.920 beings yeah if you had a BM you at home
01:05:25.079 after one week you're not going to go
01:05:26.359 look at it admire it and drive it and be
01:05:28.200 like wow this is amazing correct any car
01:05:30.279 you'll get bored of right it's like
01:05:31.599 everything else in
01:05:32.839 life but I think that marketing
01:05:35.720 messaging right like what BMW has
01:05:38.119 created yeah they've forgotten the car
01:05:40.119 for a second driving machine this per
01:05:42.720 this person who you aspire to drives
01:05:45.640 this car I think we have to figure out
01:05:47.839 how to help people who are building
01:05:50.559 Brand 0 to one build what BMW buil in a
01:05:54.480 different manner for a different world I
01:05:56.160 think Raj will have some insights there
01:05:58.319 because he's kind of building that
01:06:00.200 bridge with House Effect so I'll tell
01:06:02.400 you it's not only luxury Brands I think
01:06:04.839 this also Mass brands do every brand
01:06:07.640 does the same thing they try to play on
01:06:11.279 showing you an ideal image of somebody
01:06:13.760 you will become like the classic
01:06:15.440 examples in India I could give is the
01:06:17.520 complete man M like you know thank
01:06:21.839 you like the complete man
01:06:24.760 what they would do is hey a man if you
01:06:27.400 want to be a complete man you would wear
01:06:29.079 this an ideal situation that's trying to
01:06:30.559 sell so they always do that it's it
01:06:32.640 doesn't go with luxury it goes with
01:06:34.359 every everywhere in fact it goes with
01:06:35.920 kids as well like I'm a complain girl
01:06:38.440 I'm a complain boy everybody they got a
01:06:40.640 reason to do this right so at the end of
01:06:43.039 the day you want to tell stories and
01:06:45.240 that's how you sell and one of the
01:06:47.000 classic examples is you sell an ideal
01:06:49.160 State who you are not so by the way
01:06:51.240 always new in it there's nothing new in
01:06:53.799 it and in fact one of the big like what
01:06:56.279 I what I believe in is so let's say
01:06:58.200 luxury Brands don't want to sell it to
01:07:00.000 people who have money they want to sell
01:07:02.079 it to people who don't have money and
01:07:04.520 the reason is that like that's that's
01:07:05.960 how they are able to build their brands
01:07:08.440 in that way so they want to sell it to
01:07:10.279 like you're not the ideal TG n no but
01:07:14.400 that's but you know they want to sell it
01:07:17.000 to someone who will save for this LV
01:07:20.960 back for months and then come out but
01:07:23.240 that's not happening India yet yeah no
01:07:25.480 it no it's still there in I think it's
01:07:28.559 happened in China a lot of other
01:07:29.720 countries the us maybe us not in India
01:07:32.079 at least I can tell you that I don't
01:07:33.760 have any data but my experience amongst
01:07:35.520 my friends people are saving up for the
01:07:37.839 cars which they want to show off people
01:07:39.440 are saving up for the watches they want
01:07:40.720 to show and the biggest thing that is
01:07:43.119 happening is shoes sneakers sneakers
01:07:45.039 just started happening yes yeah so the
01:07:46.680 people are yet not not for handbags not
01:07:50.240 for clothes yet maybe but but yours are
01:07:53.079 girls are saving for handbags like a lot
01:07:55.039 of my friends and I can name 20 at least
01:07:57.240 I not more than that but 20 who've been
01:08:00.039 saving to buy an LV bag on their
01:08:01.880 birthday or like a Gucci interesting we
01:08:04.960 are out of touch yeah because so our
01:08:07.559 generation people do save up to buy this
01:08:10.880 and in fact surprising are like
01:08:13.000 boyfriends and girlfriends save up to GI
01:08:14.799 to their the partners right this this is
01:08:17.799 and it's happening and a lot of people
01:08:19.080 can relate to it because we do safe
01:08:20.759 somebody was telling me 70% of iPhones
01:08:23.479 in India are bought on credit do you
01:08:26.080 think that's true for bags and sneakers
01:08:27.920 as well are people borrowing to buy
01:08:29.560 these things I don't know about bag
01:08:32.640 specifically sneakers I know there are a
01:08:34.439 lot of people who do Buy on credits
01:08:37.359 there's a monthly payment system with
01:08:38.880 retailers there are in fact a lot of my
01:08:41.080 friends what they started doing
01:08:43.279 isday like you know have friend peerto
01:08:45.359 peer lending and then they would buy
01:08:46.679 something expensive to show it off and
01:08:47.960 then do it like that's by the way I
01:08:49.120 think it's the first the so there's a
01:08:50.839 product called bnpl byy now pay bmpl is
01:08:53.799 among the fastest growing in all
01:08:54.839 e-commerce fmms is that important like
01:08:56.679 if you're building a brand from zero to
01:08:58.359 one if you just figured out a niche you
01:09:01.399 started building a consumer brand there
01:09:04.279 how do you integrate bnpl you're a new
01:09:06.640 company you're starting at zero uh I
01:09:08.920 think by the way BNL gets automatically
01:09:10.799 integrated as you think about e-commerce
01:09:13.600 or even your own website your platform
01:09:15.439 is killed then do people come and
01:09:17.198 approach you or from the very beginning
01:09:18.600 you can from Z right I you do that with
01:09:21.960 your credit card company or
01:09:24.319 you can do it with your you know you can
01:09:25.520 do it with your payment Gateway there
01:09:27.640 are so once you have a payment Gateway
01:09:29.040 and some data there are multiple firms
01:09:31.238 that allow you uh buy now pay later
01:09:33.640 facilities obviously by the way the flip
01:09:35.560 carts the Amazon of the world all have
01:09:37.198 inbuilt programs that are quite large
01:09:39.279 but even if you're a d2c website you can
01:09:41.359 get BP buy now pay do they share a part
01:09:43.719 of the carry on the interest they charge
01:09:45.520 with the platform of course of course
01:09:48.399 and what is the rate of interest
01:09:49.799 typically I think it's high I don't
01:09:52.158 remember the date off the top of my head
01:09:54.000 uh the interest of the top it be 20 plus
01:09:56.840 for sure be 20 plus for sure right and
01:10:00.679 uh very specifically because we're
01:10:03.920 talking about this particular influencer
01:10:06.239 Le sales world now Beyond these LV and
01:10:10.159 all of that what is quiet luxury why
01:10:13.440 what part of someone's
01:10:15.520 psychology is making them buy something
01:10:19.159 for a crazy price while it should not
01:10:22.719 look like it is expensive ensive what is
01:10:24.760 working there anyone can answer that cuz
01:10:27.040 I've read about this that show is there
01:10:28.719 now I think quite luxury in India is not
01:10:31.520 yet a big of a concept there are there
01:10:33.199 are C like there are but it'll be a TG
01:10:36.159 which
01:10:37.000 is I mean no but it's still interesting
01:10:39.560 if it's working conscious
01:10:41.640 capitalism yeah so I I would say Nel
01:10:44.159 firstly by the way my sens is um I I
01:10:47.840 think the market in India for I think
01:10:50.360 we're not yet evolved to a stage of
01:10:52.719 restrained capital where you don't want
01:10:54.239 to actually demonstrate that you bought
01:10:55.400 something expensive I think that market
01:10:57.120 is very very very small but I think the
01:10:59.199 people who have arrived in life and they
01:11:01.120 don't need to prove anything to anybody
01:11:03.040 can easily move there but then why are
01:11:04.960 they spending so much like my point my
01:11:07.280 question is I buy no but for example do
01:11:09.239 you think a Pak is quite luxury I'm just
01:11:11.719 you know in my mind you know would that
01:11:13.239 be because you can't see it right
01:11:15.199 depends on which model if you don't buy
01:11:16.640 a complication you buy like a regular
01:11:18.360 one if you buy like a nautilus or
01:11:20.280 something it is not quite luxury because
01:11:22.199 it's evidently an expensive watch that a
01:11:24.360 lot of people know about if you buy a
01:11:27.280 pek constellation or a grandm chime or
01:11:30.520 something but I think regardless of that
01:11:33.920 I'm trying to figure out why somebody's
01:11:35.800 paying $1,000 to buy a t-shirt which
01:11:38.120 looks like a $100 t-shirt $50 so I tell
01:11:42.239 you okay so this is what my belief is
01:11:44.760 this is nothing to do with data but like
01:11:46.560 a psychology which seen people right
01:11:48.880 yeah so all of us and everyone we all do
01:11:53.239 things to Signal something okay so
01:11:56.280 signaling value for everyone is high yes
01:11:58.800 some people do signaling through just
01:12:01.000 appearance some people do that by doing
01:12:04.360 certain amount of deeds and some people
01:12:06.480 do it by stories so for example you want
01:12:09.080 to talk about let's say an expensive
01:12:11.880 watch in your hand which a large
01:12:14.840 majority of people can't see or
01:12:17.440 understand right but you want to share
01:12:19.320 that with your friends or the five
01:12:20.639 people who care about because they'll
01:12:22.239 ask you so you get your signaling value
01:12:24.360 by stories and that's quite luxury so a
01:12:27.480 quite luxury group will be able to spot
01:12:30.199 on a t-shirt which is really expensive
01:12:34.000 but it just looks like a normal t-shirt
01:12:35.760 so you want to signal that particular
01:12:37.920 value so it just depends on as human
01:12:39.480 being who do you want to signal to so
01:12:41.000 it's bragging value amongst your
01:12:42.800 immediate who do you want like who do
01:12:43.960 you care about signaling and it's a very
01:12:45.280 small community in this very well said I
01:12:47.760 would say like I don't wear a watch nor
01:12:49.719 a ring yeah nothing I don't show any
01:12:53.120 brand on my clothes ever maybe that's
01:12:55.600 the personality you want to show because
01:12:58.000 that's a signaling value I actually
01:12:59.639 really I also thought it was quite
01:13:00.800 insightful I think signaling is the key
01:13:02.760 sort of in this so Bas so this message
01:13:06.199 of what you want to
01:13:08.400 signal is it authentic and
01:13:12.120 organically personality type which
01:13:14.800 determines what you want to Signal or is
01:13:16.719 it what is cool in society at that point
01:13:18.639 of time is that a manipulation too I
01:13:21.040 genuinely believe it goes on three steps
01:13:24.040 okay first is because you just want to
01:13:26.600 become cool amongst your peers so
01:13:28.440 whatever is trending you want to do that
01:13:29.800 that's certain level of signaling once
01:13:31.639 you're done with that then it goes with
01:13:34.960 your preferences and choices and then
01:13:38.639 third is to you to achieve objectives
01:13:40.800 that you want to achieve so first
01:13:43.000 example is like if I am let's say a
01:13:46.920 50,000 rupe to one lak rupe income
01:13:49.520 person I want to buy a really expensive
01:13:52.600 shoe to show off my friends because
01:13:54.639 that's the physical value because like
01:13:55.880 this is cool this new Jordan is becoming
01:13:58.040 cool I want to show that because it's
01:13:59.800 trending I want to show that once I
01:14:01.760 reach like an upper level of income or
01:14:03.360 whatever maybe a taste go go with all
01:14:05.159 the brackets it's just interesting okay
01:14:07.480 one to five lakh person per month income
01:14:09.520 and then when I reach I feel this stays
01:14:11.600 on with different products till a CR
01:14:13.840 yeah and then after a CR one one to one
01:14:16.120 CR one to one CR like 50,000 to one CR
01:14:18.600 this is just different the things keeps
01:14:20.000 changing today you might just show off
01:14:22.159 like a small watch tomorrow show like
01:14:24.040 big car till one CR it goes there after
01:14:27.239 like a CR to couple of CR I don't know
01:14:30.159 that bracket I'm just making it up I'm
01:14:31.679 just telling because of PE I can I can
01:14:33.239 spot people who I can think of but not
01:14:35.320 the income so this is the second group
01:14:37.719 they go with preferences and choices
01:14:39.840 okay like I want to show signal that I
01:14:43.920 am health conscious person I am a notd
01:14:47.040 branded person I prefer that I am
01:14:51.360 environmentally uh friendly so that's
01:14:53.239 that's why there's beo here like you
01:14:54.719 know this is just the signaling value
01:14:56.760 which you want to just put it out people
01:14:58.080 that these are my preference and choices
01:14:59.480 this is what I stand for and the third
01:15:01.760 level which I go for which is which I've
01:15:03.920 seen like Ultra rich people have had
01:15:06.520 like few encounters with people they
01:15:08.760 show off a certain level of image for a
01:15:10.880 certain objective and they want to do
01:15:13.239 that signaling because they larger
01:15:14.719 purposes around that explain so somebody
01:15:18.880 would not be really really let's say
01:15:23.800 show off with Brands and stuff yeah
01:15:26.280 because they don't want other people to
01:15:27.840 think that they are the Branded stuff
01:15:30.480 they want to be like hey I have money
01:15:32.520 but I don't want you to see that I have
01:15:34.719 this money then the signaling value can
01:15:37.280 be somebody does like a great charity
01:15:39.719 doesn't speak about it sure and want to
01:15:42.080 hear it from other people that oh he did
01:15:44.239 that she did that right he doesn't want
01:15:46.040 to talk about it she doesn't want to
01:15:47.400 talk about it because that's a signaling
01:15:49.000 value that I want to put out that for
01:15:51.679 your larger purpose you want people to
01:15:53.639 think that you are too much into charity
01:15:55.560 that's why you don't talk about it
01:15:56.679 because if you talk about it you
01:15:57.760 technically come down to below level
01:15:59.360 number so nikil it's a very basic human
01:16:01.600 trait that everybody is Yugo and vanity
01:16:03.880 has to be massaged in some way correct
01:16:05.719 Agreed 100% correct it can be done in a
01:16:08.080 reverse way and it can be done in a
01:16:10.000 absolutely opposite way yeah I I think
01:16:12.040 the interesting part here is how people
01:16:15.719 evolve to figure out what their
01:16:17.880 signaling mechanism is and what they
01:16:19.679 want to signal and is there a Insight
01:16:22.239 from them from that category to build a
01:16:24.960 brand to these people CU these are
01:16:26.400 things you can utilize yeah content you
01:16:28.639 consume and people you hang out with
01:16:30.679 large majority of influence happens with
01:16:32.600 that see I think Community to Brand
01:16:34.400 building is the next big thing in my
01:16:36.400 view I think that elaborate on that yeah
01:16:39.120 so uh at least in the online world I
01:16:41.400 again right I think my my view is look
01:16:44.679 uh I mean there are a ton of influencers
01:16:46.679 and I think no there's M to sitting here
01:16:50.239 uh but I'm saying it
01:16:51.719 is uh after a point it's not about some
01:16:55.080 influencer coming in telling it is about
01:16:57.400 what your friends and your community
01:16:58.760 that you trust sort of feel I'll give
01:17:00.520 you an example we have a again gardening
01:17:03.760 like random right but gardening is very
01:17:05.760 Community Based because you exchange
01:17:08.120 steps you you think about why plans die
01:17:10.360 and you know what do you need to do and
01:17:12.080 so on right and so having influencer
01:17:14.800 based marketing sometimes may or may not
01:17:17.040 work y but actually if you have a closed
01:17:19.560 Facebook group and there are many many
01:17:21.120 many Facebook like insta groups Etc
01:17:23.440 where people genuinely actually talk
01:17:25.159 about about what their problems are and
01:17:27.880 in those if you start to infiltrate and
01:17:30.280 say the brand comes organically that's a
01:17:33.639 very different way of building a brand
01:17:35.320 true right and I think it's a very
01:17:37.000 organic always on way of building a
01:17:38.760 brand and I think there are interesting
01:17:40.320 involved categories where this community
01:17:42.440 based brand building is starting to be
01:17:43.719 quite interesting right and I think it's
01:17:45.639 very sustainable it's less expensive it
01:17:47.159 takes longer to build but it's much more
01:17:50.040 sustainable I'll add on to that that's
01:17:52.239 exactly what we're trying trying to
01:17:53.719 accomplish with house effects right
01:17:55.000 that's bang on we're not doing
01:17:57.040 influencer Le marketing we do attention
01:17:59.480 and community-led marketing because
01:18:01.480 here's what I believe in content builds
01:18:04.159 community community brings culture and
01:18:07.040 culture changes the way you buy that's
01:18:09.719 exactly the pattern that you exctly so
01:18:11.719 that's why you need a Content person who
01:18:13.920 can create such a content on such a
01:18:15.760 niche who can create a community around
01:18:17.800 it how important is it for somebody
01:18:20.600 starting brand 0o to one
01:18:23.880 to be able to create content and create
01:18:26.639 Community I think that's the way forward
01:18:29.280 and I tell you a logical reason behind
01:18:31.639 it the the biggest reason but I feel is
01:18:34.840 point of sale every time the majority of
01:18:38.080 influence happens on point of sale okay
01:18:40.400 there's obviously different part digital
01:18:42.520 Discovery different different percentage
01:18:44.400 but the large majority happens on the
01:18:45.719 point of sale so earlier the point of
01:18:47.920 sale used to happen on kirana stores
01:18:50.199 okay wherever so there would be so think
01:18:52.639 about did in a random day I ran out of
01:18:55.239 my toothpaste I use Colgate I go to my
01:18:58.120 Kira store and there's no Colgate
01:18:59.800 available he's like
01:19:02.400 by I'll buy closeup and get home that's
01:19:05.239 point of sale I'm influenced if I like
01:19:06.800 the flavor done I'm never using goldgate
01:19:08.480 again okay so that's used to be the old
01:19:10.840 way of doing it the second wave which I
01:19:13.320 think we're going through right now was
01:19:15.159 retail in marketplaces where you go in
01:19:18.760 search of something and you get
01:19:21.280 convinced to buy something as well that
01:19:23.080 is big Bazar way Amazon way or all the
01:19:26.000 places where you explore certain things
01:19:27.719 right so that's where the point of sale
01:19:28.760 used to happen now where the point of
01:19:31.239 sale is the influence is happening on
01:19:33.600 right there on the content so you're
01:19:36.120 exploring Instagram every day you're
01:19:38.239 seeing or YouTube right now you're
01:19:40.560 seeing hey this person is using this
01:19:44.600 mixer he clicks it then in there
01:19:47.360 Instagram autofills your information and
01:19:49.520 then you can check out depending on your
01:19:51.560 income level yeah you can just check out
01:19:54.239 somebody buy like a 50 rupe or 100 rupee
01:19:56.400 product there right in right off the bat
01:19:58.600 somebody would buy like a 10,000 12,000
01:20:00.800 or 10 lak rupe product right off the bat
01:20:02.639 but the point of sale is changing and
01:20:04.480 because the point of sale is constantly
01:20:06.400 changing because the content we consume
01:20:08.080 I think that's why people need to build
01:20:10.199 content L communities in order to go
01:20:12.040 ahead now does that mean that the kirana
01:20:14.880 and the marketplaces and online's going
01:20:16.920 to die not not at all did with
01:20:19.560 marketplaces Kira died no so every time
01:20:21.719 a new layer gets add on you just have to
01:20:23.159 capitalize on all three but I think
01:20:24.760 there's an interesting play that you can
01:20:26.120 start building Community or Creator Le
01:20:31.000 uh Commerce and start making products
01:20:33.040 there and then eventually once you have
01:20:34.400 enough money you can play on other
01:20:36.360 platforms so I I just had one question
01:20:38.400 actually and then a comment I think the
01:20:40.040 comment is I fully agree on the brand
01:20:42.360 building through Community I think the
01:20:44.600 question I had actually was when you're
01:20:47.679 in a mind state of consuming content
01:20:50.400 many times you don't transact because
01:20:52.880 you're not you're not going to buy I
01:20:54.320 mean when you're reading an article
01:20:56.040 you're not necessarily in the mood to
01:20:57.520 buy the reason marketplaces like mintra
01:20:59.960 Amazon flipcart Etc workers you go in
01:21:01.760 with an intent to shop right there's a
01:21:03.960 Commerce intent have you seen are you
01:21:06.360 seeing that change where people are
01:21:07.960 actually buying more because insta
01:21:09.400 shopping hasn't really taken off
01:21:11.239 globally right in any meaningful manner
01:21:13.400 I mean at the Instagram level I'm saying
01:21:15.199 but streaming in China has see that's
01:21:17.239 the only exception that I can think of
01:21:18.880 right and that is also by the way
01:21:20.760 shopping Le streaming because he so his
01:21:23.360 point is bang on that when you go with
01:21:26.199 the mindset of consuming content do you
01:21:28.520 shop or no so live streaming and social
01:21:30.480 commers is working biggest people go
01:21:32.159 with the mindset that I want buy I'm
01:21:34.480 going to get a great deal I'm going to
01:21:35.719 buy that's the mindset they're going
01:21:37.239 with okay can I ask you a question if
01:21:38.760 you're shooting this podcast yeah and
01:21:42.639 say we're shooting this show 3 years
01:21:44.719 from now if somebody likes the shirt
01:21:46.520 you're wearing they just click it and
01:21:48.000 it'll get bought in a second you think
01:21:50.560 the world will go there I by the way I
01:21:53.679 mean you know never say never but my
01:21:55.639 sense is I think that will still be a
01:21:57.679 very small percent because I think human
01:21:59.920 beings are still human beings right now
01:22:02.600 or later and I think by the way if
01:22:04.560 you're watching something on content
01:22:06.679 right you're trying to learn how to
01:22:07.960 build a brand yeah right and I think
01:22:10.320 that's what you're really focused on
01:22:11.400 you're not focused particularly on
01:22:12.840 shopping now will some percentage
01:22:14.480 convert of course they will but can you
01:22:16.159 do brand building that way 100% I agree
01:22:18.480 with the community point which is what
01:22:20.120 we originally spoke about and the brand
01:22:22.040 building through Community I think that
01:22:23.320 will happen for sure so here was I was I
01:22:25.840 want to complete that Loop that when
01:22:28.120 people go on to consume content right I
01:22:31.120 think it's very difficult for us to
01:22:34.239 decide if I am today in a mood to buy or
01:22:37.080 no yeah so because mostly majority of
01:22:40.920 time of younger people of gener
01:22:43.719 everybody in fact now is spent on
01:22:46.239 consuming content through different
01:22:48.159 means either by YouTube Instagram social
01:22:50.280 media platform anything you don't
01:22:52.159 actually know whether you're in mood to
01:22:53.480 buy or no you don't know it's a first
01:22:55.080 day of salary or it's a last day of
01:22:56.679 salary it's just you're in a hope that
01:22:58.719 okay I'm going to create content so I
01:23:00.880 was talking about three C's right
01:23:02.440 conversation convincing and then
01:23:04.159 conversion all three can happen just
01:23:06.120 there I can have a conversation the
01:23:07.920 brand building gets the brand gets built
01:23:10.199 that I'm talking about hey this t-shirt
01:23:11.960 is amazing and we talk about I can do
01:23:14.280 little convincing where we can talk
01:23:15.600 about quite luxury and stuff like that
01:23:18.120 and then someday there'll be technology
01:23:20.159 where you can directly buy and convert
01:23:22.040 there'll be small percentage of
01:23:24.000 conversion but large percentage of
01:23:25.840 convincing and a larger percentage of
01:23:27.880 conversation start see I have I think
01:23:29.920 great framing I think only tweak I would
01:23:32.000 add to it is I think there are
01:23:33.639 categories that are inspiration and
01:23:35.360 browse Le and there are categories that
01:23:37.239 are functional right just broadly yeah
01:23:40.600 if you think about browse categories
01:23:42.840 where you need to be in nobody needs to
01:23:44.360 buy three shirts or two dresses I mean
01:23:46.400 you don't right you buy because you're
01:23:48.320 inspired to buy because something yeah
01:23:50.239 see the the whole point of this right
01:23:51.920 this is like a charity project like I
01:23:53.560 keep saying this every year you want
01:23:55.719 people to learn something I want people
01:23:58.199 who want to build a brand today young
01:24:00.400 guys 0o to one to learn everything they
01:24:02.920 might need okay from all of your
01:24:04.840 experiences sure like I don't mean like
01:24:08.679 20% of it 30% of it we want to teach
01:24:11.840 them 100% got it cuz eventually we need
01:24:14.480 more brands in India which are going to
01:24:16.400 scale which are Indian Le Indian owned
01:24:18.760 all of that yeah true so I think next
01:24:21.080 section we'll take a one minute break no
01:24:22.800 but are you going to give us food at
01:24:23.719 some point or no food yeah yeah
01:24:27.940 [Music]
01:24:37.040 food hey guys ready should be so I think
01:24:42.040 the question was starting um just
01:24:44.320 getting started right and I think my
01:24:46.440 perspective comes from sort of talking
01:24:48.520 to a bunch of entrepreneurs who have
01:24:50.080 sort of built businesses call it between
01:24:52.320 0 and 25 30 crores were the people that
01:24:54.520 I initially spoke to to try and get
01:24:56.679 there I think there are some patterns on
01:24:58.199 what you need to do um and I think the
01:25:00.639 break points for me are 0 to 20 20 to
01:25:04.119 100 100 to 500 and 500 and above right
01:25:07.760 in terms of net revenue we're talking
01:25:09.800 about cres crores so in the first 0 to
01:25:13.639 20 crores in my mind I think it is all
01:25:17.639 product
01:25:18.840 driven Word of Mouth
01:25:21.280 driven community that we talked about in
01:25:23.480 content driven but it is not Performance
01:25:25.920 Marketing driven it you should have
01:25:28.199 great reviews you should have great
01:25:29.719 repeat rates you should have great
01:25:31.400 social media following you should be
01:25:33.239 part of a community right I think if you
01:25:35.239 can build it that way you're building it
01:25:36.840 in a very healthy manner the so the
01:25:40.400 product quality is probably the most
01:25:43.040 important thing in my mind to get right
01:25:45.440 followed by content and
01:25:47.719 Community followed by distribution
01:25:50.040 strategy I think you talked about
01:25:51.239 distribution strategy I think for from
01:25:52.360 the 0 to 20 crores if you can keep an 80
01:25:55.679 20% where 80% is e-commerce platforms
01:25:59.040 and 20% is DDC it's a great mix because
01:26:02.360 then you have enough consumer data but
01:26:04.239 you also have reach right that you can
01:26:06.320 actually get to so my theory is if you
01:26:08.400 can get the first 20 crores this way
01:26:10.400 it's like a very healthy way to grow if
01:26:11.920 you're going to start a brand but I
01:26:13.440 don't agree at one place 80% Marketplace
01:26:15.880 marketpl is very difficult to build a
01:26:17.440 brand and talk about the brand you get
01:26:20.000 the top line yes no but yes and no I
01:26:21.840 think it depends on what the platform is
01:26:24.360 I think for example if you can actually
01:26:27.480 take part in a program within an Amazon
01:26:30.639 or a mintra I think you can actually get
01:26:32.560 to Showcase it I'm saying look it's the
01:26:35.320 easiest way to I think there are ways to
01:26:37.480 grow that show in my view I think for
01:26:40.080 example if you are a d2c star program
01:26:42.000 and you can actually sort out an
01:26:43.199 interesting deal in uh mintra it's a
01:26:46.400 great way to grow because you have a
01:26:48.119 brand page you're able to represent it
01:26:50.760 right but they you are representing a
01:26:52.800 brand in the way they want you to
01:26:54.119 represent that's the challenge uh yes I
01:26:56.760 think within some constraints for sure
01:26:58.800 but I still think by the way it gives
01:27:00.520 you see for me I'm not trying to fully
01:27:04.400 do brand building yet I'm trying to make
01:27:06.560 sure there's product Market fit and make
01:27:08.639 sure that this see if you're a new
01:27:10.679 person starting off what do you need you
01:27:12.840 need to you need to sort of get to some
01:27:14.800 scale MH if you need external funding
01:27:17.199 you need to be able to get external
01:27:18.800 funding and you need to start having
01:27:21.440 enough Runway for you to be able to
01:27:23.000 build from the 20 to 100 right so for me
01:27:25.840 just very practically right if you focus
01:27:27.880 100% on d2c for example I think you can
01:27:30.880 represent the brand but you'll end up
01:27:32.400 bleeding money which means by the way
01:27:34.000 you'll have to raise money much
01:27:35.639 sooner right um I personally believe a
01:27:38.679 little bit differently I believe if the
01:27:40.199 brand is not right the packaging is not
01:27:43.000 right the color is not right there are
01:27:44.679 color codes there is brand codes for
01:27:46.320 everything and if you don't get it right
01:27:48.159 nothing will go right I by the way think
01:27:50.000 is sure the opposite I think there are
01:27:51.600 lots of bad brands that get sold through
01:27:54.280 Performance Marketing no it's not about
01:27:56.760 just give me one minute right just to
01:27:57.960 complete this right so I can tell you 50
01:28:00.920 brands in mintra that basically grew on
01:28:04.760 subsidy right which is either you threw
01:28:07.040 a discount at it or you thre a
01:28:08.239 Performance Marketing at it but it can't
01:28:10.119 sustain Beyond a certain number because
01:28:11.960 repeats don't come very right so I'm
01:28:14.520 saying the first 20 CR may get a
01:28:16.000 consumer right right I'm not talking I'm
01:28:17.920 talking overall if you don't get the
01:28:19.239 brand right because I personally believe
01:28:21.480 brand is like making a spaceship yeah
01:28:23.360 people take it very lightly every
01:28:25.880 because brand has to communicate a lot
01:28:27.440 it has to emote with you it has to talk
01:28:29.280 to you and if that is not correct a
01:28:31.880 great product also can't do anything but
01:28:33.719 I'll tell you by the way just one thing
01:28:35.520 I think having a great brand View and
01:28:38.239 not a great product product has to be
01:28:40.679 right right no I'm saying you have still
01:28:42.639 a chance to correct the brand from 20 to
01:28:44.239 100 if you have to take a chance it will
01:28:45.880 not work you will not reach 20 crores I
01:28:48.159 think you can right so uh give us an
01:28:50.880 example yeah so and the brand was not
01:28:53.360 right and the product was great and it
01:28:55.040 no I I'll give you an example right I
01:28:56.960 think uh Dennis lingo which is a brand
01:28:59.199 of ours wasn't particularly built as a
01:29:01.239 brand it was a 20 CR odd brand but it
01:29:03.679 works in India we started a brand called
01:29:05.360 John Miller people accepted it as
01:29:06.880 American brand by the way did right I
01:29:09.040 think same thing you used it but say but
01:29:11.560 you thought there but there is a brand
01:29:13.480 thought there no I think there is a
01:29:15.520 brand thought there but I'm saying the
01:29:17.520 first see the most limited time when you
01:29:20.159 want to start something is your time my
01:29:22.280 question is about the name somebody
01:29:24.239 thought about the brand there was a work
01:29:25.880 done there of course of course that I'm
01:29:27.719 not disagreeing with K there has be some
01:29:29.280 if you don't get the brand right nothing
01:29:30.760 goes right that's my theory we have seen
01:29:32.840 it all I have a different Theory we may
01:29:35.360 not have to agree on it right but my
01:29:36.960 different Theory by the way is that I
01:29:38.480 think it is important to be consistent
01:29:40.719 it is important to have great product
01:29:42.719 quality but I don't think you need the
01:29:44.560 complete brand definition because I
01:29:45.880 think a brand can continue to evolve
01:29:47.199 from 20 to 100 cour as well right just
01:29:49.480 different Theory right and it'll be
01:29:51.320 interesting to sort of debate out
01:29:52.719 because I can give you multiple examples
01:29:55.080 of companies where if you don't get the
01:29:57.560 product right and there's a lot of focus
01:29:59.239 on brand building you know getting the
01:30:01.280 Brand Story the brand book right you
01:30:03.600 spend on brand book and brand doesn't
01:30:05.520 make a brand
01:30:07.040 yeah anyway I think uh yeah we we are
01:30:11.639 saying the same thing but uh coming from
01:30:13.679 a different way maybe coming from a
01:30:15.080 different point of view can I digress
01:30:16.440 you a little bit sure so many large
01:30:19.159 brands in India yeah from Louis Phil
01:30:22.560 to Peter England to a certain extent
01:30:25.280 jockey
01:30:26.880 y jocky might be a franchise but the
01:30:29.560 others yeah we put foreign models yeah
01:30:33.920 on a brand that has nothing to do with
01:30:35.639 anything outside of India yeah and call
01:30:38.360 them names like you know like John
01:30:40.239 whatever and Peter whatever and whatever
01:30:42.560 yes it worked for a long time yeah will
01:30:45.880 it work I don't think so I mean I think
01:30:48.239 it uh so for example we have a brand
01:30:50.080 called kagiri and it's working working
01:30:52.080 just as well and it's but that's ethnic
01:30:55.920 um the um you know if you can find the
01:31:00.600 right name that actually see you're
01:31:03.360 wearing Western Wear some level why is
01:31:06.159 it that a Peter England or an alen Solly
01:31:07.920 has some appeal right it connotes of
01:31:10.440 Western Wear I mean so at some level you
01:31:12.840 know I agree with you Kish right saying
01:31:14.960 ethnic wear is ethnic but I'm saying
01:31:16.320 Western where is Western right I mean at
01:31:18.480 some level the reverse is also true
01:31:20.080 right so but you're I I have an
01:31:22.840 interesting anecdote on the color of the
01:31:25.199 models so I think it's
01:31:27.840 changing but one of the things for
01:31:30.000 example if you go to a MRA you find that
01:31:32.600 everybody is fair skinned right white to
01:31:36.400 do this and we ran an experiment where
01:31:39.119 you actually look at click-through rates
01:31:41.480 long time ago and you find that the
01:31:43.320 click-through rates are actually
01:31:44.280 different so purely economically the
01:31:47.080 clickthrough rates on Performance
01:31:48.880 Marketing were higher now I think that
01:31:50.760 was 15 years ago oh sorry that was 5
01:31:52.440 seven years ago elaborate your think
01:31:54.080 when you had a white as a model yeah
01:31:56.560 your click through was higher yeah the
01:31:57.960 click was higher this was seven eight
01:31:59.440 years ago why I don't know I think maybe
01:32:02.000 belief system it's a belief system maybe
01:32:03.600 it's a mindset right as we sort of think
01:32:06.560 about maybe people think it's more
01:32:07.719 premium I don't know but I think there
01:32:10.119 is some instinctive is some kind of
01:32:11.760 colonial baggage that we believe that
01:32:14.199 Western Products are better than Indian
01:32:16.000 see yeah I think for sure there is but
01:32:18.480 you know look I mean I'm not a big into
01:32:20.040 Theory right but the facts are the
01:32:21.280 following the clickthrough rates on one
01:32:22.520 were better than the other right I mean
01:32:24.440 and that was a fact and I think will it
01:32:26.960 change I think the answer is it will but
01:32:29.360 it'll be slow progression it's not going
01:32:30.760 to change overnight right so going a
01:32:33.719 little has it changed if I were to be
01:32:36.000 building a brand of t-shirts today yeah
01:32:38.280 should I call it John Jacob and get some
01:32:41.520 white South Serbian models to look like
01:32:44.800 American models on the campaign I don't
01:32:48.320 yeah so I think it's a good question MRA
01:32:50.639 does it very well
01:32:52.360 it does it does so I think the brand
01:32:54.639 name I agree a little bit with Kish I
01:32:56.199 think you have to think through it
01:32:57.040 carefully and thoughtfully I think the
01:32:58.520 name has to mean something and it has to
01:33:00.239 be a there has see people don't remember
01:33:02.080 facts n people remember stories I think
01:33:04.119 we spoke about this slightly earlier so
01:33:05.960 the brand name has to have a brand story
01:33:08.000 associated with it it may not be fully
01:33:09.560 crafted but you need you need a germ of
01:33:12.159 an idea right in terms of what that is
01:33:14.840 and that needs to be consistent will I
01:33:17.199 launch a t-shirt brand with a with a
01:33:19.480 western sounding name possible possible
01:33:23.199 but you have to think through
01:33:24.760 it I'll tell you I'll I want to add on
01:33:28.199 this right it definitely works more like
01:33:31.040 we've seen examples after examples yeah
01:33:33.639 but I think now that you can change that
01:33:36.560 with content and Community again the
01:33:39.080 reason why I'm saying this is every time
01:33:41.040 you buy a brand you need to feel proud
01:33:43.719 so if you can make people feel proud in
01:33:47.119 an Indian brand they'll buy it in a
01:33:49.639 Serbian brand they'll buy it something
01:33:51.639 from gree coming from a buy is this you
01:33:53.679 need to find out your people who can
01:33:57.000 actually find you worthy enough and they
01:34:00.199 can be proud in buying your things now
01:34:02.239 why does this now why does this Fair
01:34:06.520 skinn foreign looking model and foreign
01:34:08.560 names work because it's not just you
01:34:11.280 who's making that Community proud there
01:34:13.239 are 500 other brands also trying to do
01:34:15.000 it so that's why it just works better
01:34:16.920 because there are 500 people trying to
01:34:18.440 make this look really good explain
01:34:20.600 explain so example let's say Peter
01:34:22.400 England is trying the same thing John
01:34:23.920 Jacobs is trying to tr John Miller is
01:34:25.480 trying to do the same thing Dennis lingo
01:34:26.880 is trying to do the same I'm just giving
01:34:28.040 example sure mintra there are 20 more
01:34:30.400 people apart from you who are showing
01:34:32.719 this as a premium brand that's why the
01:34:34.360 Consolidated money just grows up there
01:34:36.600 and makes you feel more upgraded and
01:34:38.440 premium versus you individually just
01:34:41.119 pushing it but can you individually do
01:34:43.760 it yes the biggest community and content
01:34:45.800 L example is Baba ramdev right you can
01:34:48.560 sell that you can do it and make it
01:34:50.280 super Indian and actually do it that's
01:34:51.880 the biggest Creator Le story in India
01:34:53.719 that has happened okay I'm going to
01:34:54.600 reframe reframe my
01:34:56.600 question baring content in community
01:34:59.480 neither of which I have I want to start
01:35:02.080 a t-shirt brand today yeah where I'm
01:35:04.960 going to put some print on the t-shirt
01:35:06.400 which is in English what is the path of
01:35:08.800 least resistance where do I have the
01:35:10.880 most Al so firstly by the way sorry
01:35:13.000 sorry I just had a slightly different
01:35:14.480 framing of this right if I want to start
01:35:16.080 a brand today I don't know by the way
01:35:18.840 unless there's something reasonably
01:35:20.639 unique about the t-shirt brand with some
01:35:22.560 meaning that I want to start whether I
01:35:23.679 would start a t-shirt brand really good
01:35:25.040 quality yeah it's too generic and too
01:35:27.840 General right I think so the the first
01:35:30.440 thing to do is you know how crowded is
01:35:32.639 the
01:35:33.360 space how large is the space and do I
01:35:35.920 have a unique value proposition so for
01:35:37.440 example I won't run one more ethnic
01:35:39.199 brand t-shirt brand how how does someone
01:35:41.280 learn that if I'm thinking of t-shirt
01:35:43.480 yeah how do I learn how crowded is the
01:35:45.320 space I think the easiest way actually
01:35:47.639 and the most practical way is to go
01:35:49.280 search for t-shirts on MRA and find how
01:35:51.400 how many choices and how many Brands you
01:35:52.679 have it's a representation of the market
01:35:54.400 you category you have it for a lot of
01:35:56.719 categories but I'm saying you know some
01:35:59.480 categories are low ASP and huge variety
01:36:02.600 what is ASP uh average selling price
01:36:05.239 right so low ASP products with high high
01:36:08.920 competition is not something that I
01:36:10.480 would go and do a brand in see if you
01:36:13.320 want to launch something right so the
01:36:14.880 first you 20 the question is focus we
01:36:17.639 spoke about this earlier also focus on
01:36:19.760 something which is a niche be a shark in
01:36:21.920 a p right for the for this so that you
01:36:24.520 can actually differentiate in some
01:36:26.080 meaningful manner at least for the first
01:36:28.440 20 crores y right just to complete my
01:36:31.040 framing since it's taking a little bit
01:36:32.440 of time the 20 to 100 CR in my mind the
01:36:35.320 skill especially if you're doing it
01:36:37.040 online has to be around most efficient
01:36:39.800 Performance Marketing most efficient use
01:36:42.159 of community for brand building so that
01:36:44.119 you don't spend a lot of money on brand
01:36:45.400 building but you build it organically
01:36:46.760 how would you do that the more content
01:36:49.560 that gets which trans which travels and
01:36:52.080 more people that get eyeballs without
01:36:53.520 you paying Google tax and Facebook tax
01:36:55.360 how do you do that it's viral content
01:36:57.480 it's around continuously putting out
01:36:59.080 content it's around creating a community
01:37:00.639 it's is that the key then today to build
01:37:02.280 a brand is it content in community not
01:37:04.600 just for influencer Le brand but all
01:37:06.360 brands I think it is a large part of it
01:37:09.239 but it is not the only part of it I
01:37:10.880 think it's a big part of brand building
01:37:12.679 between 20 and 100 crores because it's a
01:37:15.360 less it's a more so again I'll give you
01:37:17.280 an example for us we do a lot of our
01:37:19.440 brand building through men's XP and Ida
01:37:21.560 it doesn't cost us we own the content
01:37:23.080 platforms for the 20 to 100 cres it's
01:37:25.440 most effective way to do it because you
01:37:26.600 spend 1 2% of your Revenue as opposed to
01:37:28.760 4 5% of your revenue and you get to the
01:37:30.760 same kind of reach right and and that is
01:37:33.679 an easier and more cost-effective way of
01:37:35.600 doing it I think the hard part and the
01:37:38.199 boring part especially if you're more
01:37:40.040 online offline also I think we I'm sure
01:37:42.159 you'll have added points on the online
01:37:44.800 side knowing how to do growth hacking or
01:37:48.400 Performance Marketing on Amazon flip
01:37:50.960 cart mintra Google Facebook is a core
01:37:53.719 skill between 20 and 100 gr can you tell
01:37:56.000 me what is growth hacking yeah so in an
01:37:59.599 offline
01:38:01.400 space your shelf space and your location
01:38:04.239 matters yes where your placed matters in
01:38:08.239 the online world the first six swipes on
01:38:11.440 a mobile phone are the only thing that
01:38:13.320 matter after that by the way your
01:38:14.679 attention span you know you never get
01:38:16.520 reach right so you search for trousers
01:38:19.480 right you find you find a bunch of
01:38:21.639 trousers you swipe the phone six times
01:38:24.360 the first six pages matter now the first
01:38:27.679 six pages you can get to by two ways one
01:38:30.239 is by paying Amazon flip cart mintra
01:38:32.599 Nika Etc a lot of money which is you pay
01:38:35.000 for it and you get a slot right does it
01:38:38.400 cost uh I think it varies by category
01:38:41.040 few hundred rupees for t-shirt for for
01:38:43.159 an SKU so just think about it a t-shirt
01:38:46.520 sells for call it $3.99 right you may
01:38:50.040 end up paying 30% 100 rupees for a for
01:38:54.000 Performance Marketing and getting a slot
01:38:55.599 so it's quite expensive to do so what is
01:38:57.480 growth hacking how do you get to those
01:39:00.080 spots without paying for it and how do
01:39:03.320 you do it do you think 100 bucks per
01:39:05.119 click see by the way the cost per click
01:39:07.520 will be less the cost per click for an
01:39:09.960 average t-shirt will probably be in the
01:39:11.960 30 40 range but you'll need to sort of
01:39:14.360 do Performance Marketing for a long
01:39:15.719 period of time you have to stay there
01:39:17.080 for a long period of time right and the
01:39:19.119 conversions are not that high so there's
01:39:20.639 cost per click and there's cost per
01:39:22.360 conversion right and there's a long drop
01:39:24.599 between the two just because since
01:39:25.800 you're the platform guy here give me
01:39:28.280 like three specific hacks which can
01:39:30.880 bring down this cost for me who started
01:39:33.119 a new t-shirt brand very simple you have
01:39:35.360 to find out it's a little bit like what
01:39:37.239 Raj said you have to find out what each
01:39:38.800 platform values mintra values freshness
01:39:42.360 mintra values fresh stock so new Styles
01:39:45.599 coming on all the time therefore if you
01:39:48.239 want to make minra your primary platform
01:39:50.639 you basically have to introduce more
01:39:53.199 frequent drops and you have to get
01:39:55.159 tagged to what's new it's a it's an easy
01:39:57.800 hack right so you valid expain tag
01:39:59.520 towards new let me give an easier
01:40:01.639 examples because mintra is the more
01:40:03.080 complicated one um Amazon values
01:40:07.080 consumer reviews and ratings yeah so
01:40:10.119 getting the first 100 reviews and
01:40:12.080 ratings right through customers through
01:40:14.239 friends through family all legitimately
01:40:15.960 there's an Amazon wine program that you
01:40:17.480 can do all of that actually matters the
01:40:19.880 most for you to be placed on so do you
01:40:21.719 manufacture these ratings you don't
01:40:23.639 manufacture them you actually by the way
01:40:26.320 make it happen through uh Amazon has a
01:40:28.800 program where basically people give
01:40:30.280 honest reviews but you can pay Amazon
01:40:32.080 for a
01:40:32.880 review right so there's no problem
01:40:35.159 whatever the review is the review is If
01:40:36.400 the product is good quality you can
01:40:38.080 actually do it I'm sure there are lots
01:40:40.119 of ways to do it outside but I'm saying
01:40:41.560 the the the legitimate way to do it is
01:40:44.159 Amazon has a Vine Program which is very
01:40:46.000 very cost effective B right where you
01:40:49.080 can basically sort of get get the first
01:40:51.480 100 reviews or 100 ratings to get I'm a
01:40:53.320 t-shirt company I figured out some
01:40:56.040 co-packer who makes t-shirts I want to
01:40:58.400 print something on it I printed it yep I
01:41:01.960 go to Amazon yeah how how does the
01:41:05.599 listing happen like how do you get it
01:41:07.679 listed on Amazon yeah so I think this is
01:41:09.320 like getting back to very 101 but I
01:41:11.440 think the first thing is you have to
01:41:12.520 register as a seller okay which is a
01:41:14.400 little bit of a process Amazon is very
01:41:15.880 easy and self Ser very Democratic flip
01:41:17.960 cart and mintra are very hard uh just
01:41:20.320 because it's need to register as a
01:41:21.920 seller you just need a GST number a
01:41:24.360 company right there's nothing that's
01:41:25.599 needed so you need a private limited
01:41:27.080 company you don't need private propr as
01:41:29.719 well yeah you can do a proprietorship
01:41:31.159 most companies a lot of companies
01:41:32.400 sellers are actually proprietor by way
01:41:34.560 so uh it's very easy on an
01:41:36.880 Amazon little less easy on flip cart
01:41:39.560 harder on mintra harder on AO I think in
01:41:41.760 that order right as far as fashion
01:41:43.880 because Amazon is the most self- serve
01:41:46.080 of the lot which is you don't need to
01:41:48.239 talk to a person in order to make this
01:41:50.119 happen right in most other platforms you
01:41:53.040 have to talk to somebody and that takes
01:41:54.840 time effort and convincing I'm sorry
01:41:56.760 sorry I'm going back a step but if I
01:41:59.119 have an idea of how I how a t-shirt
01:42:01.280 should look how do I find the right
01:42:04.040 manufacturer for it so um I mean there
01:42:06.599 are many ways you can do it but but how
01:42:08.599 do I find a good one yeah so there is a
01:42:10.840 list of maybe 500 man so firstly by the
01:42:13.080 way it depends on your auto quantity I
01:42:14.880 think depending on every size there are
01:42:16.599 people who can actually manufacture it
01:42:17.800 for you t-shirt by the way no T-shirt is
01:42:20.480 you go trur and you walk around and you
01:42:22.119 can get t-shirt manufacturers online
01:42:24.159 India Mart to India and you can find a
01:42:26.520 manufacturer right the quality is
01:42:28.400 definitely not at bar but you can get
01:42:30.400 like a sense of what you can do yeah so
01:42:32.599 Nik by the way sorry maybe taking even
01:42:34.280 more of a step back right you know I
01:42:36.480 think brand building requires a little
01:42:38.679 bit of thinking and effort right you
01:42:40.280 can't come and suddenly say so for
01:42:41.639 example if you want to go start a
01:42:43.040 t-shirt brand I think it's actually
01:42:44.320 quite difficult to do because you need
01:42:45.400 some level of expertise you do need to
01:42:48.000 understand something about t-shirt
01:42:49.199 manufacturing and so on there has to be
01:42:51.119 some you can't I mean it's like meat
01:42:54.040 right as opposed to you know you can't
01:42:55.360 just do starter right I mean in my how
01:42:57.360 do you inculcate that learning okay so I
01:42:59.840 was can I add something to this please
01:43:01.480 please how to start a brand thing
01:43:03.719 because I think I've started a lot of it
01:43:05.599 and failed at multiple times so and I've
01:43:08.040 done this trading buying from indiia Mar
01:43:10.400 and selling on Amazon I've done this
01:43:11.960 like as a side hustle for longest time
01:43:14.000 right say that again so I used to what I
01:43:16.880 used to do I used to buy from indiaart
01:43:19.800 and sell it on Amazon
01:43:21.760 okay so there was no brand nothing I saw
01:43:24.040 that the mops were growing in India the
01:43:26.880 Thousand rupee mop I don't know if you
01:43:28.320 seen this yeah yeah right that I don't
01:43:30.679 know how to explain like that's the one
01:43:31.920 which sucks up the right so I saw that
01:43:34.800 that was there's another bucket where
01:43:35.920 you squeeze it in so you can go on
01:43:37.480 indiamart from Gujarat you can get
01:43:39.000 somebody to give give you that 200 to
01:43:40.800 300 rupees you call it and then you list
01:43:43.400 it on Amazon you sell it for 1,000
01:43:44.920 rupees and then commission amission cut
01:43:47.800 you get like 100 150 rupes per how much
01:43:50.239 commission does Amazon charge so it
01:43:52.080 depends on different categories
01:43:53.239 different but and there's so many you
01:43:55.840 know that's Amazon's I think the biggest
01:43:57.719 problem that there's there's no exact
01:44:00.159 transparency on everything on commission
01:44:02.080 basis because there is definite 22% is
01:44:05.080 somewhat which you end up P by the way
01:44:06.480 lowest is 15 highest is 35 right
01:44:09.320 depending on but you keep like it's that
01:44:12.119 is something which you face problem if
01:44:13.560 you're starting out and that's problem
01:44:15.560 so I used to do this I used to sell
01:44:16.960 vegetable Choppers I ended up making 10
01:44:18.920 lak Rupees as profit of vegetable
01:44:20.239 Choppers
01:44:21.239 uh because I bought a 50 rupees sold for
01:44:22.800 400 this I used to do on Amazon so I'll
01:44:25.239 tell you in this thing which I learned
01:44:27.840 about how to start a brand there are two
01:44:30.480 definite questions that you got to ask
01:44:32.119 yourself first is what is your
01:44:35.400 strength some people strength might be
01:44:38.520 getting products in cheap
01:44:42.800 because right if you can't buy it in
01:44:45.360 cheap you can't sell it so if your
01:44:47.320 strength is not negotiating and buying
01:44:49.199 and have a control over sourc you can't
01:44:51.400 do that so let's say that's not your
01:44:53.080 strength yeah then is your strength
01:44:55.520 building content Community something
01:44:57.639 like that then you do that what if my
01:44:59.920 strength is designed so let's say yeah
01:45:02.000 I'm coming to that let's say you design
01:45:04.040 that's a product differentiator okay so
01:45:06.280 now that's your strength y so do you
01:45:08.719 have I think there are three type of
01:45:10.000 strengths one is brand building and
01:45:11.520 content second is sourcing and third is
01:45:13.119 unique Innovation and design and
01:45:14.560 everything of that and the fourth is
01:45:15.960 your ability to some people have a
01:45:17.560 dramatically better ability to growth
01:45:19.679 hack Amazon grow flip cart I was going
01:45:22.440 to that is that such a big distinction I
01:45:24.800 think yeah yeah
01:45:26.480 absolutely in this I think for sure for
01:45:29.800 even in the old world if I have
01:45:31.679 connection yeah the entry and the shell
01:45:33.760 space and the yes exactly so even in the
01:45:35.800 old world if I have connections with big
01:45:37.400 Bazar or dmart I can probably like get
01:45:39.239 listed and start selling much faster
01:45:40.840 than anyone else so that used to happen
01:45:43.199 how does someone build this I find more
01:45:45.920 interesting than the rest how does
01:45:47.920 someone build the knowledge of these
01:45:49.800 growth hacks hire someone who has that
01:45:51.760 knowledge I think U can I just take that
01:45:53.760 maybe you can uh add to it right so uh
01:45:57.040 Amazon is the most straightforward to
01:45:58.440 become more expert on because I think
01:45:59.960 there is lots of case law knowled
01:46:01.840 available knowledge and availability
01:46:03.239 because you have it it's happened in the
01:46:04.719 US it's happened elsewhere and therefore
01:46:07.400 by the way it's easier to learn and the
01:46:10.239 algorithms are more transparent you can
01:46:11.719 go read up online you can figure out
01:46:13.719 what to do um I would say most of the
01:46:16.520 other platforms Flipkart is almost there
01:46:18.119 as well I think getting closer and
01:46:19.960 closer to self serve in Walmart and so
01:46:22.119 on I think on mintra Etc the way I would
01:46:24.800 sort of think about it is I would
01:46:26.599 actually go talk to ex MRA people most
01:46:29.719 practical way to do it is to go talk to
01:46:32.360 two category managers so let's say I
01:46:34.000 want to do
01:46:35.080 t-shirts since it seems like your
01:46:37.000 favorite brand to launch um I would go
01:46:39.520 talk to the category manager on t-shirts
01:46:41.719 right or actually I would go talk to
01:46:43.239 them and say firstly is there an
01:46:44.920 opportunity for a t-shirt is there an
01:46:47.080 opportunity at a certain price point is
01:46:49.000 there an opportunity at a certain design
01:46:50.920 so people are looking for plus sizes
01:46:52.599 people are looking for oversized
01:46:53.679 whatever right people are looking for
01:46:55.599 pop culture like what Raj was saying
01:46:57.360 whatever it is I would get some insights
01:46:59.880 from one of these guys to narrow this
01:47:02.159 down in terms of what does it take to
01:47:04.719 growth hack on mintra by the way I'm now
01:47:06.639 finding more and more blogs that are
01:47:08.639 available and so on I don't know if you
01:47:09.920 guys have searched for it but it's quite
01:47:11.679 interesting people talk about mintra
01:47:14.440 being a visibility Le platform so there
01:47:17.040 are two types of platforms one is you go
01:47:18.840 search for something and you get to a
01:47:21.280 product the other is you go browse for
01:47:23.080 something and you get inspired to a
01:47:24.400 product so that's visibility lead the
01:47:26.480 other is Search Le Amazon is search lead
01:47:28.480 minra a or visibility Le there the real
01:47:31.199 thing to understand is what are all the
01:47:33.760 visibility triggers so you go look for
01:47:35.920 filters what's new what's hot you know
01:47:39.599 price low to high right size right so
01:47:43.480 you go keep looking for what is it that
01:47:45.840 the platform looks for it's no different
01:47:47.440 than his idea on Google and Facebook on
01:47:49.440 Insta in wants to do reals therefore he
01:47:51.639 does reals minra wants to sell what's
01:47:54.440 new and therefore you figure out how to
01:47:56.480 hack that way into it right so that's
01:47:57.920 how you go find out I think the easiest
01:47:59.480 is to there are now some online
01:48:00.880 resources but talking to a few X people
01:48:03.480 is the most practical way to get started
01:48:05.679 can I add a layer on there the other
01:48:08.360 most important so these are the skills
01:48:10.199 that you can develop on go and you can
01:48:12.560 talk to these people and you can do it
01:48:14.159 the second most important question you
01:48:15.599 should ask yourself is where is my ideal
01:48:18.880 customer spending time H okay so I'll
01:48:21.159 give you an example of a pizza company
01:48:22.639 they did crazy really really well in
01:48:25.199 this this was in
01:48:26.440 us so they found out that their ideal TG
01:48:30.159 is spending a lot of time on multiple
01:48:32.280 platforms one of them needs to be dating
01:48:34.520 sites dating apps right so let's say
01:48:37.239 pick up a Tinder or a bumble or
01:48:38.800 something like that they started showing
01:48:40.880 ads there and they were like if she
01:48:44.040 gives you number faster than we deliver
01:48:45.719 our pizza you get 30% off now that's a
01:48:48.760 growth hack yeah this is what growth ha
01:48:51.400 me so you need to ask yourself question
01:48:53.000 now imagine that's a massive massive
01:48:55.239 massive technique because a lot of
01:48:56.920 people would do it just to satisfy their
01:48:58.639 ego not because of that and correct
01:49:00.520 correct correct you need to ask yourself
01:49:02.840 where are your people spending time and
01:49:05.599 need to find out underprice attention in
01:49:07.719 that because if you can't find
01:49:09.119 underprice attention there's very hard
01:49:11.679 to sell a very very you know difficult
01:49:15.239 product or as basic product as t-shirt
01:49:17.440 and now coming to starting point where
01:49:19.040 you ask me how if you want to start a
01:49:21.040 t-shirt company how would you do it so
01:49:23.040 here's I ask a question myself if I
01:49:25.440 don't have a differentiated product I
01:49:27.679 try to think of if I don't have a unique
01:49:29.400 selling preposition I ask myself do I
01:49:32.000 have a unique show off
01:49:33.480 preposition because you can show off
01:49:35.440 preposition because if build a show offy
01:49:38.639 you can do it let's say I have none of
01:49:40.440 this I don't know how to show off
01:49:42.000 because design comes in the show off
01:49:43.320 play You're great designer you can build
01:49:44.960 something that people will show off if
01:49:47.119 let's say I don't have any of this I
01:49:49.119 would I always ask myself question
01:49:51.280 what's pre and post because so this goes
01:49:54.719 when the my most fmcg like you know not
01:49:58.080 not clothing like not fashion I would
01:49:59.639 like personal grooming and stuff like
01:50:01.760 that right so if there's a shampoo
01:50:03.960 Market which is popping in India I don't
01:50:06.159 want to launch another shampoo I would
01:50:08.520 ask myself a question what can I do to
01:50:10.880 sell somebody who's using shampoo after
01:50:13.159 shampoo post product or a pre-product a
01:50:16.440 pre before shampoo what they can do or
01:50:18.520 post shampoo what they can do because
01:50:20.159 that's how I get an entry to somebody
01:50:22.239 who uses exactly my thing and once I get
01:50:25.159 an entry automatically I'll start
01:50:26.920 selling my other products as well yeah
01:50:28.560 and by the way the the way we sort of I
01:50:31.520 mean the way I would sort of do it just
01:50:32.800 building a little bit Raj on that is
01:50:34.560 three post is one I think literally by
01:50:38.159 the way um again I I go back to the very
01:50:40.960 basic thing Amazon actually you can go
01:50:43.159 and find out longtail key search words
01:50:46.520 you can find out where there is null
01:50:48.199 sets you can say by the way in the last
01:50:50.040 last month what are the search results
01:50:52.480 that led to zero and you find all of
01:50:54.960 them and you stack rank them by volume
01:50:57.480 and then you say that's what I want to
01:50:58.440 go do I'm saying this I think unfortun I
01:51:01.000 mean so since since this a podcast where
01:51:02.840 people want I think there's so much of
01:51:04.840 data out there if you actually make a
01:51:06.520 little bit of effort you can actually
01:51:08.119 make dramatically better judgment calls
01:51:10.040 than 90% of the population right and
01:51:12.119 this growth hacking applies to Google
01:51:14.119 and Facebook the most so if you start D
01:51:15.719 to see right the real question there is
01:51:18.639 how do you not pay as much Google in
01:51:20.159 Facebook tax and there there's an entire
01:51:22.639 science behind it right how do you
01:51:23.920 actually think about SEO how do you
01:51:25.280 think about the structure of your
01:51:26.280 website how do you think about what
01:51:28.159 keywords to bid on how do you that's
01:51:30.000 beyond you're saying 25 to 100 the next
01:51:31.960 phase that's the 20 to 100 so 0 to 20 I
01:51:36.119 know we had a slight difference but not
01:51:37.560 dramatic but my sense is great product
01:51:40.360 initial brand value proposition 80%
01:51:42.639 Marketplace 20% DDC 20 to 100 crores by
01:51:46.920 the way continue to crack something
01:51:48.599 that's unique it can be I think to
01:51:50.480 larest point it can be sourcing it can
01:51:51.960 be design it can be whatever and crack
01:51:54.679 Performance Marketing whether it's
01:51:56.400 Google Facebook Amazon content whatever
01:51:59.079 it is build something around
01:52:01.440 it 100 and above to 500 you have to
01:52:04.599 figure out how to make offline work
01:52:06.520 which is a different skill set for a lot
01:52:07.840 of people who have started it this way
01:52:09.760 you have to figure out and really make
01:52:12.360 sure that the product goes from push to
01:52:14.520 pull what do I mean by push to pull what
01:52:16.719 is the percentage of organic sales
01:52:18.040 versus what is the percentage of
01:52:19.159 adrenaline sales which is Performance
01:52:20.960 Marketing that percent from 20 to 100
01:52:23.599 maybe call it 50/50 performance and
01:52:26.520 organic 100 plus that Performance Based
01:52:30.320 sales should come down to 30% because if
01:52:32.960 it doesn't 30 40% it doesn't it just the
01:52:36.079 cost of it keeps going up and up and up
01:52:38.239 and up and up right in the Amazon of the
01:52:40.320 world you know the one interesting thing
01:52:42.960 how you can build a brand is also uh
01:52:46.560 that used to happen in offline at least
01:52:49.119 you look at CAD categories which are
01:52:50.400 Super unorganized and what is getting
01:52:52.440 organized so for example ATA so I read
01:52:55.920 this was again 20134 I read that 94%
01:52:58.920 India still buys chuata that was
01:53:01.800 2013 I was like okay because 94% is
01:53:05.159 still unorganized the way it's like not
01:53:08.960 it's just going away from cities
01:53:11.119 probably there's going to be a time
01:53:12.480 where this won't happen and that's why
01:53:14.760 there's an opportunity to build at an
01:53:16.040 art brand makes sense any opportunity
01:53:17.920 you're seeing now unorganized to
01:53:20.400 ored I think toilet specifically I see
01:53:23.320 as an opportunity give me an example
01:53:25.320 like cleaners toilet cleaners pre-s
01:53:28.440 sprays post sprays yeah uh you know seed
01:53:31.440 sprays I don't know I don't know what
01:53:33.480 product I've not spent enough timea is
01:53:35.199 doing a lot of this be safe yeah yeah
01:53:37.719 I've not spent enough time to understand
01:53:39.920 what products but I think toilet as a
01:53:41.520 category is popping up because a lot of
01:53:43.599 people not just don't want their house
01:53:45.639 to smell good but also their toilets to
01:53:47.560 smell good I think pets is the other big
01:53:49.239 one in mind yeah it's immediate and
01:53:50.920 people are sping for it yeah so I mean
01:53:52.880 look there's one new store which has
01:53:54.280 opened here which is huge head yeah
01:53:56.880 heads up for taals so I think pets is
01:53:58.840 interesting I mean you know everybody's
01:54:00.560 heard of dinks apparently there's
01:54:02.280 something called D what is
01:54:04.920 DS no kids right my daughter was
01:54:08.360 explaining now this to me saying there's
01:54:10.280 dink wad there's double income no kid
01:54:12.960 with a dog that's me right double income
01:54:16.440 yet but but I didn't know second income
01:54:18.440 is in indoor second comes so uh so so
01:54:23.280 this population is growing and they
01:54:26.920 spend on the dog or the cat as much as
01:54:29.920 they spend on their baby right I mean or
01:54:31.480 child but I think this is an interesting
01:54:33.079 space Market there's a market and I
01:54:34.719 think it's going to explode Singapore
01:54:36.840 yeah that's like very small Market yeah
01:54:38.560 Singapore but I think the Singapore will
01:54:40.480 spend we were talking about naming a
01:54:42.679 brand in between for a second yeah how
01:54:45.400 does how does one figure out what to
01:54:48.599 name a brand let's sck to the T-shirt
01:54:50.679 example what should I name this brand
01:54:52.920 I'm starting let's say I have borrowed
01:54:56.440 managed to get 10 lakh rupes I'm
01:54:58.760 starting a t-shirt brand I need to
01:55:00.599 figure out the name first how do I go
01:55:02.360 about naming my brand so I'll tell you
01:55:05.119 uh uh a colleague of mine who is a brand
01:55:08.280 Authority in a way and uh his daughter
01:55:11.079 started a brand and she started exactly
01:55:13.400 with a T-shirt and she named a brand
01:55:15.639 creatures of creatures of
01:55:18.000 habit in the first instance I didn't
01:55:20.560 understand much and it was a d2c brand
01:55:23.400 and I think they are they are now
01:55:26.199 profitable what
01:55:28.000 worked I think the brand the product but
01:55:31.159 the name worked for a particular reason
01:55:32.960 creatures of habit I think I think the
01:55:35.000 d2c world is accepting a little bit of a
01:55:37.199 odd name story a story it's telling a
01:55:40.280 story yeah by the way new research there
01:55:43.520 is just adding to this nine out of uh 10
01:55:47.719 genzies believe on Advertising yeah
01:55:50.960 maybe different ways different sorts but
01:55:53.199 if you tell them that you're advertising
01:55:55.360 people are receptive to see that
01:55:57.760 advertise and buy something on that
01:55:59.599 there's no level of M so you can name
01:56:00.920 your brand uh anything you can name your
01:56:03.040 brand nickel also I think and we can
01:56:05.679 create a story around the word n that's
01:56:07.679 what I was going to say a word
01:56:08.760 inherently has a story in the word is it
01:56:11.320 a it helps of course it helps right I
01:56:13.719 mean if you have Tesla and you're
01:56:15.199 running an electric car company I mean
01:56:16.960 it helps right so I think can you just
01:56:18.800 come up with the name for t-shirt
01:56:20.000 company which has a story in the
01:56:22.199 name can I add like I wouldn't choose
01:56:25.040 any name which is like Which is popular
01:56:29.079 I would choose a name which is easily
01:56:30.440 available on SEO and correct that's what
01:56:32.199 I was also say I would come up with
01:56:33.599 something which has no meaning yeah
01:56:35.360 because if you choose a word which has
01:56:36.800 meaning then you're fighting against
01:56:38.360 something already so would you say
01:56:40.280 something which doesn't have a meaning
01:56:42.239 truly but sounds
01:56:44.560 like certain and it sounds like
01:56:47.079 something it sounds interesting so I'll
01:56:48.719 give you an example of of our brand
01:56:50.400 recently we named Blanco it's a perfume
01:56:52.800 brand yeah okay so we named it Blanco
01:56:55.639 because King in his day-to-day lingo in
01:56:59.000 language he uses Blanco as a substitute
01:57:02.480 for winning lifestyle and confidence so
01:57:04.920 he has given meaning to it Blanco like
01:57:07.480 white Blanco is it has no meaning but
01:57:10.719 Blanco is is equal
01:57:12.880 to French way to say
01:57:15.280 white it could be so it just means
01:57:17.960 confidence in winning giving a meaning
01:57:19.920 to the name which has no meaning and
01:57:21.599 then it C catches up on the story n my
01:57:24.440 my nephew started a brand on gut health
01:57:27.360 and they were working the whole Insight
01:57:29.520 was uh there are good bacteria and there
01:57:32.280 is bad bacteria so how should you and we
01:57:35.639 want to attack that uh good bacteria has
01:57:38.280 to be more to kill the bad bacteria yeah
01:57:40.960 so we worked on uh along with them and
01:57:43.679 we call the brand the good bug H and it
01:57:47.239 caught on quite well at the
01:57:49.920 Bren not being the good B I think the
01:57:51.599 story would have been different that's a
01:57:53.520 good name actually yeah that's a good
01:57:54.639 name everybody like the name no but or
01:57:56.880 peanut butter right call it my fitness
01:57:58.480 my fitness that's a great name it's a
01:58:00.119 great name but doesn't that get lost my
01:58:01.679 fitness no actually by the way trademark
01:58:03.360 is available which is why it was done
01:58:05.679 but my fitness is extendable right and
01:58:07.920 basically you have to take a brand
01:58:09.159 positioning you can either say mother
01:58:11.920 giving the child healthy things which is
01:58:13.760 one positioning the other is you're an
01:58:15.719 athlete or a gym goer who needs protein
01:58:18.480 in which case my f is a perfect fit both
01:58:20.599 is there another Trend that anything
01:58:22.679 food yeah where you at Fitness is just
01:58:25.800 selling more today no I don't think so
01:58:27.960 nothing like that I don't think so I
01:58:29.560 mean this case on Peanut Butter it was a
01:58:31.520 good name but I think it I think peanut
01:58:33.480 butter it was exactly the time where it
01:58:35.360 was just happening and we in foodall
01:58:37.520 created a machine and where we were
01:58:38.840 selling people could take out the peanut
01:58:40.639 butter you can take any correct correct
01:58:43.520 correct but it's really taken off now I
01:58:45.440 mean as a trend it's really food do is
01:58:47.639 is is crazy I just want to because named
01:58:49.520 food all I want to give you an Insight
01:58:51.280 on what I saw so what I did there was
01:58:53.920 raspberries yeah just put there okay
01:58:56.960 this is I'm talking about I think Santa
01:58:58.800 Cruz whilea food all right yeah so the
01:59:01.079 raspberries right so it was let's say
01:59:03.480 price at for example thousand yep there
01:59:05.760 was right next to it I think to there
01:59:08.560 was like Brazilian raspberries or
01:59:10.719 something like there was some countries
01:59:11.760 name in it right same and there was like
01:59:13.599 2,000 something that was expensive I
01:59:15.239 don't exactly know the price but there
01:59:16.400 was just this one country name I kept it
01:59:18.960 both of them together 10 10 I just stood
01:59:21.360 there to see like what happens the 2001
01:59:25.079 got finished like quicker than the
01:59:26.679 Thousand rupee one food as a market like
01:59:29.199 people if you add a story to it that
01:59:31.400 it's Brazilian or Portuguese or
01:59:32.920 something people buy like is that true
01:59:35.040 or like origin matter
01:59:37.520 origin very crazy to me just to write an
01:59:39.920 origin and it will fly faster than the,
01:59:43.400 rupe one because the price was crazy
01:59:44.719 different if the price is higher do
01:59:46.599 people automatically assume higher
01:59:48.760 quality
01:59:49.840 uh yes within a band explain so for
01:59:52.880 example if you basically say know you
01:59:55.400 guys no I I I think that's true what
01:59:57.760 you're saying like just go no no I see
01:59:59.239 look I mean um let me give you um let me
02:00:03.119 give you the my fitness example we
02:00:05.040 charge more than our competitors who are
02:00:09.079 in the same sort of space right I don't
02:00:11.440 know happy low XY Z right whatever we
02:00:13.800 charge more we charge by 20% more the
02:00:17.800 minute you get to 50% % more there is
02:00:20.679 actually a basket cost see because by
02:00:22.760 the way a a a a 500 G last for what is
02:00:28.079 see basically if you want to buy
02:00:29.280 something right you know you have some
02:00:30.920 amount that you spend on grocery right
02:00:33.280 can't you buy that bag that they give
02:00:34.840 you in put everything in it you need
02:00:36.760 just he me out he me out so you know
02:00:38.159 there is a certain amount of money I
02:00:39.520 want to spend right it can be at a
02:00:42.679 premium but it can't break the bank so
02:00:45.280 for example if I'm spending a th000
02:00:47.079 rupees on 5 500 G of peanut butter
02:00:50.639 suddenly you start to think a little
02:00:52.159 differently but if I'm spending 200
02:00:55.599 rupees more there is a breakpoint right
02:00:58.480 so I don't know if that's making sense
02:00:59.679 right so there's a band for every one of
02:01:01.320 these within that band I think premium
02:01:03.639 people think it is actually you're
02:01:05.320 charging a little bit more the packaging
02:01:06.880 makes a difference all of that makes a
02:01:08.159 difference but I don't know maybe sure
02:01:10.199 you can comment on it but if you charge
02:01:12.199 five times for a utilitarian thing then
02:01:14.000 I think it gets to be tough I have to
02:01:15.560 say like digressing here my favorite
02:01:17.880 kind is shopping is supermarkets yeah
02:01:20.679 there is some the only kind of shopping
02:01:22.239 I'd go do in person yeah there is
02:01:24.480 something so therapeutic about being in
02:01:26.520 a supermarket picking up all these
02:01:28.360 random boxes which have like weird
02:01:32.119 colors on them so they've got something
02:01:34.239 in the physical shopping bang on I don't
02:01:36.800 know how much research has gone into it
02:01:38.320 a lot of research lot of research lot of
02:01:39.800 research so there are there are codes
02:01:42.199 for every category so you'll find
02:01:44.280 similar color codes for a particular
02:01:46.159 category so every category uh is thought
02:01:49.920 in a particular way and if you move away
02:01:51.880 from that Cod it just doesn't sell the
02:01:54.239 consumers get used to a certain like if
02:01:56.400 you look at the toothpaste you will find
02:01:57.679 the red and white as a color code if you
02:02:00.480 move away from that it becomes
02:02:01.960 difficulty so so packaging design how
02:02:05.400 the mind works I think so much of
02:02:06.920 research has gone into building a Brand
02:02:09.480 Packaging design everything so you guys
02:02:12.040 said Health if you necessarily add into
02:02:14.360 every product is not selling more it
02:02:17.520 doesn't mean that exactly
02:02:19.639 but the odds of it selling more go up
02:02:22.199 maybe maybe for a while I I think
02:02:24.360 something which has not been discussed
02:02:26.400 also is whatever you create what is the
02:02:28.960 longetivity of that yeah and what does
02:02:31.000 brand mean brand means you are getting
02:02:33.000 instead of a commodity of X rupees a
02:02:35.199 kilo you are getting X Plus 30%
02:02:38.480 something that's what the brand is all
02:02:39.679 about and you have to position the brand
02:02:42.079 in a way that you can keep on getting
02:02:43.679 that premium until when you will be able
02:02:45.840 to get that premium so as a peanut
02:02:47.880 butter now how how is he building the
02:02:49.599 brand that it will have that longetivity
02:02:51.079 to get that premium that's right
02:02:52.599 throughout the year throughout the
02:02:53.719 lifetime I think that's where the brand
02:02:55.440 will stand out I think by the way con
02:02:57.760 sorry sorry no no just to baby just
02:03:00.119 complete that I think the longevity
02:03:01.480 point I really think is important
02:03:02.760 because I think Brands get built up over
02:03:04.960 decades no but if you build on growth
02:03:06.920 hecking how will the brand long happen I
02:03:09.320 think there are two different things K I
02:03:10.960 think there is a distribution and how do
02:03:12.599 you optimize the distribution fair right
02:03:14.400 it's like getting the right Mall space
02:03:16.920 right you in in your days you would get
02:03:18.639 the space I think that's a different
02:03:20.400 problem than building brand Building
02:03:22.040 Product and so on which is absolutely
02:03:24.079 important for me to do so I'm saying
02:03:25.679 growth hacking is the new way of getting
02:03:27.239 a great space in a mall right the
02:03:29.400 analogy right I think here on brand
02:03:31.800 building I think this consistency point
02:03:33.560 is important you have to be known for
02:03:35.320 something that compounds over time right
02:03:37.960 you know it can be taste it can be um so
02:03:41.480 for example in our my in the in the my
02:03:43.840 with the the peanut butter right I think
02:03:45.440 there is usually oil separation that
02:03:47.119 happens because it's emulsified so we
02:03:49.920 have done an emulsification which is
02:03:52.119 make sure that it it still it still
02:03:53.840 separates but it doesn't feel like oil
02:03:55.400 so when you take it and taste it when
02:03:56.800 you open it it just is nicer it can be
02:03:59.360 it can be small thing right it can be a
02:04:00.880 large thing but you need something that
02:04:02.719 differentiates this and is consistent
02:04:04.599 over time or if you have a fashion brand
02:04:06.440 right you need some design direction
02:04:08.800 that may change but the ethos is still
02:04:11.639 consistent over a long period of time
02:04:13.119 right because I think it takes
02:04:14.159 compounding to build a brand right and
02:04:16.719 my point is they're not at odds with
02:04:18.079 growth hacking my my point is growth
02:04:19.360 hacking is distribution for me
02:04:20.800 distribution right so like two Brands
02:04:23.520 which comes to my mind in the new
02:04:25.599 digital world or one was mamad which was
02:04:28.400 built around onion as a
02:04:30.199 ingredient was it yeah onion oil was the
02:04:33.599 ingredient and through which now they
02:04:35.840 have extended the brand to many
02:04:37.119 production categories but they why did
02:04:39.000 onion oil work for them I think people
02:04:41.719 had memories about onion oil being
02:04:43.320 healthy for the hair but nobody had
02:04:46.079 nobody had thought about it and they
02:04:47.719 came into that market
02:04:49.760 and there was another brand which was
02:04:50.880 built around coffee which is m caffa m
02:04:53.559 caffine caffine yeah do you know of any
02:04:55.840 other things like onion oil which have
02:04:57.840 not been we are just uh uh my son-in-law
02:05:00.960 is launching a brand called in Beauty
02:05:02.840 space which is uh which is a milk as a
02:05:05.599 base Dairy as a base the science of milk
02:05:08.960 and milk again has been a lot of
02:05:10.400 connotation around Beauty but nobody
02:05:12.159 Dove uses milk they uses milk as a
02:05:15.360 Insignia they uses it in the packaging
02:05:17.400 but they don't use milk in the product
02:05:18.760 but they use it in the packaging right
02:05:20.599 so milk has a lot of connotation in
02:05:22.360 Indian uh culture so you saying pick
02:05:25.440 something from I think Aura many people
02:05:28.639 have over everything old in new form
02:05:31.280 yeah yeah is coming in see I think
02:05:33.360 there's a there are two ways to sort of
02:05:34.800 play the beauty game right I think there
02:05:36.480 is a ayurveda versus science do Aura
02:05:40.960 Market has been overdone I can see Kama
02:05:43.360 and Forest Essentials as the leaders in
02:05:45.520 that premium and patanjali at the bottom
02:05:48.760 I think there's still see I think Beauty
02:05:50.400 as a market is still so underpenetrated
02:05:51.920 there's room for many many Brands I do
02:05:54.320 think you need some real differentiation
02:05:56.040 however what I think just putting just
02:05:58.599 putting Aura doesn't mean anything right
02:06:00.280 I think you need efficacy and you need
02:06:02.400 to actually build a little bit of real
02:06:04.000 research anybody describe efficacy or
02:06:07.679 why does somebody not compare product A
02:06:10.360 to B based on efficacy so firstly by the
02:06:12.679 way I do think people do more so at
02:06:14.280 least when I was growing up I I don't
02:06:16.079 think I ever looked at the back of a
02:06:17.440 bottle on what the ingredients
02:06:19.559 my kids today by the way look through
02:06:22.280 every ingredient yeah and then whether
02:06:23.800 it's crueltyfree paraben free see these
02:06:27.119 are things that don't register but I
02:06:28.760 think the Next Generation actually does
02:06:30.480 look at this and does look at the
02:06:32.079 ingredients so firstly I think that is
02:06:33.440 changing I think except for maybe factor
02:06:36.679 of affluence or is that India W largely
02:06:40.559 India one India one for sure but I also
02:06:42.719 think it's awareness so that 120 million
02:06:45.119 people will care about these things very
02:06:47.320 much very much and they the 120 care
02:06:50.520 more about it now because there is more
02:06:52.599 information available online and content
02:06:54.159 and so on so I think there are people
02:06:55.880 talking about it so there's more
02:06:57.079 awareness so we did can I add on this
02:06:59.320 yeah so every time you're going to build
02:07:01.000 a brand which is in a cluttered category
02:07:02.800 you can either build it by aspiration or
02:07:04.960 education so you can either Aspire
02:07:07.320 people for your products to buy them
02:07:09.360 that your product significantly better
02:07:11.199 value or you can educate them about the
02:07:13.760 efficacy and the stuff that you were
02:07:14.880 talking about so for example minimalist
02:07:16.840 did the exact same thing minimalist
02:07:19.159 came here started educating people on
02:07:21.400 certain ingredients certain things which
02:07:23.280 were always there but nobody talked
02:07:25.559 about it so honestly and transparently
02:07:27.520 right and that's what it works so either
02:07:28.639 you educate people or you Aspire people
02:07:31.360 to do and build your brand in a certain
02:07:33.079 way especially in a cluttered category
02:07:34.760 right clutter C that's what I'm talking
02:07:36.440 about like when you do basic product you
02:07:38.440 need to be because and this works by the
02:07:41.040 way even in tier 2 tier three in
02:07:42.360 villages as well you educate them on
02:07:44.119 certain things they they buy so it just
02:07:48.000 works so so we did we did Health kind of
02:07:50.480 helps but not necessarily the only
02:07:52.719 factor in determining which product you
02:07:55.079 would pick Y what about and we said
02:07:59.079 breaking down the ingredients using what
02:08:02.280 is not harmful matters to the 120 people
02:08:05.440 120 million people in India a India one
02:08:08.679 what about sustainability and climate
02:08:10.280 change I see like whenever I look at a
02:08:12.800 pitch from a consumer facing brand
02:08:15.679 Everybody by default has Health
02:08:17.639 sustainability
02:08:19.119 these things are very generic in common
02:08:20.960 clean Beauty clean Beauty so if
02:08:23.880 everybody's doing them is there any
02:08:25.320 value left in them uh I think it should
02:08:28.199 be done but is it a sales point in the
02:08:30.960 manner that people are selling it so
02:08:32.320 there are three phases of any beauty
02:08:34.079 brand of fmcg this I'm only learning
02:08:36.119 from Korea because Korea has
02:08:38.679 been ahead of it right so there were
02:08:41.280 three phases first 10 of those Beauty
02:08:44.960 okay just like beauty products they will
02:08:46.800 come with a certain level of value you
02:08:48.679 buy it function and you go ahead second
02:08:51.159 was performance so performative Beauty
02:08:53.520 how they call it functional Beauty how
02:08:54.760 they call it they spot on say this
02:08:56.920 product will make your acne disappear
02:08:59.559 prod very Sol okay and then third level
02:09:02.760 comes with the clean Beauty okay because
02:09:05.159 so I don't think India perform of beauty
02:09:07.239 is being deployed so well to clean
02:09:09.320 beauty that it's I this is my view I
02:09:11.360 think we're far from that but I'm
02:09:12.639 telling you looked 100 pictures from
02:09:15.520 brands in food and Beauty in 95 of them
02:09:18.599 have sustainability return in their
02:09:19.880 pitch Tech yeah so I think a little bit
02:09:21.400 of very small
02:09:23.320 I was in tech in The Last Five Years
02:09:25.679 everybody had to put on a pitch but I
02:09:27.199 think it's a pitch Tech thing I don't
02:09:28.679 think it's a differentiation thing right
02:09:30.360 in my view I mean the real question is
02:09:33.040 will somebody pay a premium for it I
02:09:35.800 think the answer will be almost same
02:09:38.360 organic also in a way yeah correct I'm
02:09:41.119 saying will somebody pay premium for it
02:09:42.599 because it costs more to get to be
02:09:44.079 sustainable the answer is almost always
02:09:46.199 no if the answer to that is no there's
02:09:47.960 no econom iic model so I think should
02:09:50.559 one do it and be responsible the answer
02:09:52.440 is yes is it a selling factor for a
02:09:55.159 customer to be able to pay more my my
02:09:57.920 current sense is no Kish would you like
02:10:00.360 to go with the insights like some of
02:10:02.639 them from what we had discussed I think
02:10:05.440 we when we we started understanding the
02:10:07.719 new age consumers who are digital first
02:10:10.679 consumers and we looked at uh their
02:10:13.480 color of pursuit the new Lifestyles and
02:10:15.599 we found something very interesting we
02:10:17.199 found a group of a lot of women coming
02:10:19.719 together and uh getting into especially
02:10:23.840 in restaurants you can see them bunch of
02:10:25.679 them together not the evening time not
02:10:28.280 in morning time you used to see them I
02:10:30.040 think it's happening because of uh lot
02:10:31.760 of free time and uh and people want to
02:10:35.800 go out and experience a lot of new
02:10:37.800 things and uh I think and getting that
02:10:40.960 freedom to go out then there is a
02:10:43.599 chemical know it all like we were
02:10:44.880 mentioning his your child wants to read
02:10:47.079 everything behind so there lot of
02:10:48.280 consumers now who wants to live read
02:10:50.440 everything what's written on the back of
02:10:52.280 the pack and they're very conscious
02:10:54.000 about the ingredients getting used
02:10:55.920 another Community we are looking at is
02:10:57.800 gated communities people who live in
02:11:00.000 gated Apartments they and yeah he must
02:11:03.040 be the belandur community I don't know
02:11:05.280 he lives here okay okay so this is
02:11:08.079 another community so I think community
02:11:11.000 and I think they have a lot of common
02:11:12.199 interest they play a lot together the
02:11:15.000 stre they we try and play a lot together
02:11:16.920 too and another huge uh another
02:11:20.719 lifestyle which is x-free life I don't
02:11:22.440 want gluten I don't want this I want
02:11:26.000 this I think there are so many NOS in
02:11:28.360 the preferences of um so in a way are
02:11:31.920 you saying India is now so Broad and
02:11:34.599 diversified that instead of saying we
02:11:36.880 will build for even India a which is 120
02:11:39.440 million people you need to break it down
02:11:42.199 to micro niches and build specifically
02:11:44.599 for them like I need to build you can
02:11:46.000 build a brand around that and then it
02:11:47.360 can expand to
02:11:48.719 because ultimately you have to enter a
02:11:50.320 category is that how a brand should be
02:11:52.360 built 0 to1 identifying a Micro Niche
02:11:54.520 not going too broad you can't go broad
02:11:56.960 very difficultly agree the Shar a p very
02:11:59.280 difficult to build you have to be Niche
02:12:01.599 you have to become the big fish in a
02:12:03.280 pond first yes yeah and then enter in
02:12:05.400 somewhere like like how Mama entered in
02:12:08.119 and now they have expanded into many
02:12:09.760 many categories would that also mean for
02:12:12.320 categories which are really large with
02:12:14.239 ITC and H and Marico and all these
02:12:16.679 companies there's no Point wasting time
02:12:19.079 to try and compete with them I don't I
02:12:20.920 think they they they know that they have
02:12:23.280 a very strong balance sheet and
02:12:24.520 ultimately every brand which is getting
02:12:25.920 buil which will be successful will be
02:12:27.920 bought over by them because they will
02:12:29.400 take it to that next 200 to, for sure so
02:12:33.679 no point building there no they have the
02:12:35.559 distribution they have the reach they
02:12:37.440 directly competing with one of their
02:12:38.960 products without some differentiation I
02:12:40.760 think there's no point they don't allow
02:12:42.920 they don't allow you in our earlier afar
02:12:44.760 we had a brand called tasty treat which
02:12:46.400 was into biscuits and uh we garnered
02:12:48.880 quite a substantial market share in
02:12:50.559 borne we captured 3% uh in waer biscuit
02:12:54.239 we captured 25% but uh the amount of
02:12:58.199 cases they uh they came after us uh yeah
02:13:01.320 on everything by cases what do you mean
02:13:03.440 your brand is identical similar they'll
02:13:05.480 find something or the other right they
02:13:07.320 will not let you survive they they
02:13:08.679 believe that uh that shelf space and the
02:13:11.199 mind space belongs to them and it
02:13:13.280 belongs to nobody and they will not let
02:13:15.280 anybody come into that and when they buy
02:13:17.239 you do they buy are you at a premium yes
02:13:19.559 yeah yeah yeah yes I think all the
02:13:21.000 recent d2c purchases have been at a
02:13:22.559 premium but I think the odds of
02:13:24.280 succeeding that are so low that you
02:13:25.559 should not attempt it yeah I that's what
02:13:27.520 I was going to say I think I think it's
02:13:28.920 not bad yeah and uh because they they
02:13:32.800 can't do that Innovation they can't
02:13:34.079 build it and secondly you have to start
02:13:35.400 somewhere in a Nish right not that Cel
02:13:38.000 has not attempted they they went in they
02:13:40.079 attempted something like a good life
02:13:42.599 long name I think it didn't work yeah
02:13:46.000 yeah so I think the niche thing is
02:13:47.639 because see can you compete so I think
02:13:49.840 the only counter to that is my sense and
02:13:52.639 I think even that is changing quite
02:13:53.880 rapidly if you ask me 3 four years ago I
02:13:56.280 would say most of the big players were
02:13:57.960 not digitally very good so you could
02:14:00.880 actually still create some scale online
02:14:03.119 and then figure out a way to see if that
02:14:04.520 was enough I don't think that's true
02:14:06.040 anymore I think all of them are now
02:14:08.079 quite good digitally and so I would
02:14:10.480 certainly not go head-to-head
02:14:11.800 competition I me especially if we're
02:14:13.079 starting right right would you like to
02:14:14.760 go with another Insight Kish is the OG
02:14:16.840 he can give us hundreds there is a I I
02:14:19.040 would say somebody has to somebody has
02:14:20.840 to start a brand around something I
02:14:22.400 would rather do it for gamers and
02:14:24.440 gamblers there not a single single brand
02:14:27.280 for them and they are huge in
02:14:29.159 numbers ging compan people who game a
02:14:32.000 lot okay and people for them keyboards
02:14:36.079 for them whatever no no maybe some brand
02:14:38.599 around them brand around them as well
02:14:41.199 you will be subconsciously talking to
02:14:43.000 them in a particular way and they will
02:14:44.440 relate to you midnight scrollers that's
02:14:47.440 a huge Community again like neut Tropics
02:14:49.880 stuff like that which not that product I
02:14:51.679 think they are a group of
02:14:54.199 people they are a community by
02:14:56.119 themselves they're a community and can
02:14:57.280 you build a product for the community so
02:14:58.520 you're not talking about utilitarian
02:14:59.840 stuff for them you're talking about
02:15:01.440 position interesting interesting I think
02:15:03.920 the way of hitting a micro yeah yeah
02:15:05.599 it's a Micro Niche right right another
02:15:07.440 Insight
02:15:09.840 wow this is good no I like uh like we
02:15:13.960 want my daughter wanted to get into uh
02:15:17.040 something around children H so we
02:15:19.719 thought of uh getting into through a
02:15:22.400 furniture brand building a not a
02:15:24.159 furniture brand but getting into
02:15:25.239 Furniture as a category yeah but then we
02:15:27.280 thought of a she thought of a name that
02:15:30.119 how can we design it around uh the the
02:15:34.280 child and how uh you can work around the
02:15:37.239 well-being of the child and the
02:15:39.360 imagination of the child and child's uh
02:15:41.760 growth so we call the brand smers we
02:15:45.440 entered through a category which is very
02:15:48.440 Niche stud study
02:15:50.559 tables India has two and a half CR
02:15:52.840 babies produced and even 12% of that is
02:15:55.480 30 legs yeah in the community which we
02:15:58.480 want to make them spend money on right
02:16:01.199 then into beds we can getting into toys
02:16:05.679 the it's it's smarts around childhood
02:16:08.960 but like if I slept on a Smart's bed
02:16:11.639 from when I was 5 to 15 when I'm 22 and
02:16:14.760 making a shopping decision will I
02:16:16.199 remember smart stuff yeah you will not
02:16:19.199 but you're not but we are getting to
02:16:20.599 that audience only see there's enough of
02:16:22.360 a replacement Market I think I think
02:16:24.079 children's Market I mean we have there's
02:16:26.520 it's for some reason there are not many
02:16:28.159 large Brands and I there's not a single
02:16:29.800 brand yeah and so I think there's a huge
02:16:31.880 opportunity in children's clothes
02:16:33.280 children's accessories so this brand now
02:16:35.439 can be extended into clothing also but
02:16:37.200 very limited line of clothing which
02:16:39.040 talks educational uh messages okay
02:16:42.080 another very like intrinsic to the
02:16:45.160 conversation qu question I had
02:16:48.558 how important is it to have many skews
02:16:51.240 if you're starting a new brand in
02:16:53.120 fashion clothing so Cosmetics it's a
02:16:56.638 great question or is it better to start
02:16:59.318 a brand with fewer SKS and depend on the
02:17:02.478 category you're getting in let's talk
02:17:03.840 about fashion fashion may I would say if
02:17:06.439 you are doing a d2c not more than 60 70
02:17:09.120 options to start
02:17:10.920 with and that's across sizes yeah sizes
02:17:14.120 are separate options so 60 70 options in
02:17:16.840 full size sets I would agree with that I
02:17:19.000 think the only U sizes are separate size
02:17:21.760 are separate sep total number of SK will
02:17:24.040 be large large right so 60 times a size
02:17:26.280 set which is 322 whatever right so very
02:17:29.840 difficult to manage otherwise and is the
02:17:31.558 way to build these is the way to build
02:17:33.478 these Brands you create a bunch of
02:17:35.558 inventory and keep it so you're able to
02:17:37.879 fulfill or I believe that I come from a
02:17:40.359 physical world and the digital world is
02:17:42.359 very different in fashion and I believe
02:17:44.879 digital brand in fashion has to do X
02:17:47.280 number of stock turn otherwise there's
02:17:48.558 no sense Y at least there their stock
02:17:50.959 turn has to be in excess of 78% 7 eight
02:17:53.120 times minimum what is a stock turn in
02:17:55.679 the phys stock T is what stock you
02:17:57.519 holding and how many how much you are
02:17:58.879 able to rotate it how fast how much it's
02:18:00.840 working Capital Management n right so I
02:18:03.120 by the way fully agree I think uh
02:18:04.760 firstly the only tweak I have is in
02:18:08.478 general online values width more than
02:18:12.599 depth the reason is purely algorithmic
02:18:16.200 what happens is you have
02:18:18.120 600,000 skus in a
02:18:21.398 mintra number of skus that are attacked
02:18:23.760 to a same brand name is one weightage in
02:18:26.398 an algorithm that basically then says
02:18:28.599 you're a large brand and therefore you
02:18:30.120 get automatically more visibility right
02:18:31.679 so width is valued more than depth
02:18:33.638 because you have no shelf space
02:18:35.200 limitation in the online World therefore
02:18:37.638 by definition when you're doing it
02:18:39.120 online versus offline you need more
02:18:40.760 options right I 100% agree I think with
02:18:44.638 Kishore I think in online um I'm going
02:18:48.398 back a little bit to my McKenzie sort of
02:18:50.080 days right it is important to think
02:18:53.200 about what I call design for fast
02:18:55.718 turnaround yeah right um and what I mean
02:18:58.920 by that is by the way you know a
02:19:01.000 standard lead time for making a product
02:19:03.599 maybe 60 90 days but we don't operate
02:19:06.160 like that so the question is what can
02:19:07.359 you standardize right so can you keep
02:19:09.638 the same fabric and can you customize it
02:19:12.120 right can you sort of dye the fabric
02:19:13.959 different colors but keep the base
02:19:15.120 fabric gray fabric the same so I think
02:19:17.519 quick turnarounds which is I think
02:19:18.920 kishor's point and thinking about a
02:19:20.959 manufacturing backend supply chain that
02:19:23.000 works with width is really critical
02:19:25.478 incidentally by the way I think it's
02:19:27.040 equally critical for beauty can you
02:19:30.240 start a beauty brand with 60 70 SKS if I
02:19:32.840 you me much
02:19:34.000 fewer you need much less right like five
02:19:36.679 skes 10 SK yeah so 10 SKS you're fine I
02:19:39.959 I said 60 options not SKU so that's a
02:19:42.280 lot what the difference between 60 60
02:19:45.160 designs in all sizes stock keeping unit
02:19:48.720 versus a right option yeah but I think
02:19:51.880 it's uh you know I think this width
02:19:53.520 versus depth is I think one of the most
02:19:55.240 different interesting things totally in
02:19:56.840 the digital world in the digital versus
02:19:58.720 the and and I think there's again this
02:20:00.479 is an interesting growth hack if you can
02:20:02.760 figure out a backend system that can
02:20:05.000 turn out fast number of options that get
02:20:08.479 cataloged very quickly you can sort of
02:20:10.600 build on generative AI so that
02:20:12.160 cataloging becomes faster then you have
02:20:14.520 another sustainable Advantage right to
02:20:16.560 figuring out how do you actually win in
02:20:18.000 this what is the role of AI in all this
02:20:20.280 tomorrow will there be a time where I go
02:20:23.800 online I think of what kind of t-shirt I
02:20:27.760 want what kind of cosmetic product I
02:20:30.120 want AI generates it for me right away
02:20:32.920 and chips it to me so I think there is
02:20:36.160 very um I'm sorry to sound more mundane
02:20:38.640 and boring but I think there is real
02:20:40.439 value in data science and machine
02:20:42.359 learning in the business operations of
02:20:45.240 fashion so I just want to take a minute
02:20:47.080 to do it I think the um I I'll come to
02:20:50.319 the most extreme example we did some of
02:20:51.880 that experimentation but I think it's
02:20:53.120 more an experiment in the mintra world
02:20:54.920 right but I'll tell you what the most
02:20:56.920 difficult problem in fashion is it's
02:20:58.760 actually demand forecasting at some
02:21:00.960 level how much inventory to make what to
02:21:03.120 make Etc and have that ready I think if
02:21:06.600 you use machine learning and data
02:21:08.000 science as algorithms we're using it now
02:21:09.960 you are able to forecast with better
02:21:11.479 accuracy right what are the factors what
02:21:14.040 are the moving parts so the biggest
02:21:16.040 thing is the same SKU right option SKU
02:21:19.520 doesn't repeat what a machine learning
02:21:22.640 algorithm is able to figure out is what
02:21:24.520 you call a clustering one black dress is
02:21:27.160 similar to another black dress which is
02:21:28.680 similar to another black dress therefore
02:21:30.600 I use the history of the previous data
02:21:32.760 to predict what a new option is going to
02:21:34.800 do if you can get that algorithm right
02:21:38.120 then your ability to forecast accurately
02:21:40.040 becomes much better and if you have more
02:21:41.399 and more data which you do in an online
02:21:43.000 world you're able to do it dramatically
02:21:44.880 better I'll give you another interesting
02:21:46.640 example
02:21:47.840 if you take pricing when you discount a
02:21:51.399 product when the inventory keeps going
02:21:53.120 down and what do you price it at
02:21:55.319 actually is a very difficult problem to
02:21:58.280 do and most people do it
02:21:59.520 unscientifically you can change your
02:22:00.760 price converted into a science it's
02:22:02.280 fully I mean we have converted it right
02:22:04.000 so for example for us one of the big
02:22:05.680 Tech products that we build is pricing
02:22:07.520 it's data science L pricing again you
02:22:09.080 have a volume price elasticity curve for
02:22:10.560 every SKU it doesn't matter whether it's
02:22:12.720 a fashion SKU my fitness SK etc for the
02:22:14.880 algorithm right how how relevant or
02:22:17.240 cardal is delivery time say we're
02:22:20.399 talking about platforms right yes if you
02:22:23.200 can bring manufacturing time down to say
02:22:25.720 24 hours why do you will you eventually
02:22:28.439 get to a world where you don't need to
02:22:29.800 have any inventory somebody orders you
02:22:31.600 manufactur and Ship N you know when 3D
02:22:34.680 manufacturing came about we thought
02:22:36.439 supermarkets will be over there'll be 3D
02:22:37.920 manufacturing machine you go there and
02:22:39.240 produce whatever you want and take it
02:22:41.120 home but it didn't work it didn't happen
02:22:43.399 but Supermarket is wide in terms of raw
02:22:46.560 lot of products could have been made
02:22:48.760 M your spectical lot of things could
02:22:51.040 have been made maybe the raw material
02:22:53.200 was the Monopoly or something was there
02:22:54.640 otherwise 3D manufacturing would have
02:22:56.880 could have sold almost every product
02:22:58.240 especially for fashion it seems to make
02:23:00.080 sense right lot of things I would say
02:23:02.200 because fashion a lot of Home Goods no
02:23:04.000 what you're saying fashion you're saying
02:23:05.760 no inventory or 3D manufacturing so I
02:23:08.160 think it's a very difficult I mean it's
02:23:09.520 theoretically Poss I mean theoretically
02:23:11.399 anything is possible but I would say I
02:23:13.600 think it's a little bit far away in my
02:23:15.600 view I think is it possible to use
02:23:17.600 machine learning to reduce inventory and
02:23:19.359 reduce wastage the answer is absolutely
02:23:21.080 and I think it's it's differentiated
02:23:23.479 enough that if you build this as a as a
02:23:25.240 real
02:23:26.160 capability you know you get two three
02:23:28.120 four percentage points more in bid that
02:23:30.840 I think makes a or or profits that makes
02:23:32.720 a big difference I saw some devices like
02:23:35.080 I think the reason I buy a lot of things
02:23:38.520 offline not online especially shoes like
02:23:41.840 my running shoes which I wear in the gym
02:23:43.520 for example is you have to touch them
02:23:45.240 and feel them yes is there a solution to
02:23:47.640 that problem ever no no I I I think
02:23:52.640 material surfaces there has been some
02:23:54.279 development yes but not there yet but it
02:23:57.520 might come about but the sense of uh
02:24:00.120 touch and that emotion and the feel
02:24:02.160 which you go through still long long
02:24:04.479 you're saying for those categories don't
02:24:05.920 even attempt to build online bus it
02:24:07.960 might change to a certain extent
02:24:10.040 material surfaces at least I believe
02:24:11.800 there will be something which will come
02:24:13.000 about I think there will be I mean my
02:24:14.680 read by the way is look in shoes I think
02:24:16.560 there's touch feel and size size by the
02:24:19.000 way today you go on minra there's a size
02:24:20.840 finder for you it it turns on the camera
02:24:23.000 of your phone there's 3D and you get the
02:24:24.399 size it still don't get the touch and
02:24:25.720 feel but you solve a third of the
02:24:27.680 problem but let me get more specific we
02:24:30.160 have a investment in a common friends
02:24:32.200 company called Vu Main Street
02:24:34.240 Marketplace high-end
02:24:37.080 sneakers do you think if I'm buying a
02:24:39.359 shoe for 800 rupees or 1,000 rupees I
02:24:42.800 would be okay with punting online but if
02:24:45.479 I'm buying a shoe for 102 ,000 rupees I
02:24:48.520 would never shop online no it's not true
02:24:50.880 you would I would still shop online I
02:24:52.920 think by the way the I buy online you
02:24:54.560 would buy online yeah I think what is
02:24:56.399 different though is the level of trust
02:24:58.439 in the person who sells it needs to be
02:25:01.000 and the brand needs to be dramatically
02:25:02.560 higher right um it is true that Beyond
02:25:06.120 5,000 the volumes drop precipitously you
02:25:09.120 have used the brand once and you would
02:25:10.399 have used the brand once what if I've
02:25:11.840 not used we're talking about people who
02:25:13.319 are building a new brand are we saying
02:25:16.200 that if you're going 0o to one in a new
02:25:18.359 brand say for example if you want to
02:25:20.439 build a sneakers price more than 20,000
02:25:22.640 rupes online very difficult very
02:25:25.520 difficult online don't attempt it I
02:25:26.760 won't buy I would not do it I mean I
02:25:28.840 would not do it you you go offline I
02:25:30.560 mean in that case then I think that's
02:25:32.160 the right but I think people will take
02:25:33.840 uh they will they have some inquiry
02:25:35.399 they'll take it to their homes one can
02:25:37.200 do that but here's what you can solve
02:25:39.640 right if you see genuine user
02:25:41.200 testimonials then also you might buy
02:25:43.279 online yeah for example but does anyone
02:25:46.080 believe that anymore because everybody's
02:25:48.240 I think people do believe it people do
02:25:49.520 see reviews and ratings people believe I
02:25:51.560 think they they obviously do a little
02:25:53.319 bit of research saying you can buy from
02:25:55.000 Amazon no I'm not saying you can buy by
02:25:56.640 the way just again sorry just to be very
02:25:58.600 clear so that people don't get the wrong
02:26:00.160 view since a lot of people hopefully see
02:26:01.600 this podcast uh I don't think it is okay
02:26:04.200 to get fake reviews just to be very
02:26:06.439 clear I do think it is okay to solicit
02:26:08.760 reviews which are honest reviews right
02:26:11.120 right you know it can be a bad review by
02:26:12.640 the way D Amazon will send you email
02:26:15.000 saying can you this that's right so I'm
02:26:17.080 not for a minute talking about getting
02:26:18.479 reviews randomly I'm saying by the way
02:26:20.720 do it in a actual manner hopefully your
02:26:23.319 product is also a good one so people
02:26:24.760 will give you a good review there right
02:26:26.240 another big thing online shopping they
02:26:28.040 say 20 to 30% are
02:26:30.200 fakes if you can't trust a platform to
02:26:33.279 curate fakes can I tell you the core of
02:26:35.960 what the problem is it's actually a very
02:26:37.359 nuanced problem this is from my minra
02:26:39.760 days right 30 plus% of products in
02:26:43.960 fashion get return okay the return goes
02:26:47.840 to a
02:26:48.920 warehouse there is a warehouse guy who
02:26:51.279 cannot understand the difference between
02:26:52.920 one Nike and another Nike let's say the
02:26:55.720 customer returns a different Nike to you
02:26:58.399 there is a chance that it can go into
02:26:59.960 the yeah into the inventory it happens
02:27:03.319 is that how most come about online of
02:27:05.479 course there are there are scamsters who
02:27:06.920 have been created out of this new econom
02:27:08.720 so people are buying correct shoes and
02:27:10.359 then and then they return return a fake
02:27:13.040 shoe and they keep could it is it that
02:27:14.800 hard for Amazon to imprint a bar but
02:27:17.560 kind I think we I think you know
02:27:20.680 everything by the way can be solved and
02:27:22.399 everything by the way keep people find
02:27:23.720 new ways around it right so for example
02:27:25.800 we used to sell ethnic wear in minra I
02:27:28.359 think one of the things we did in ethnic
02:27:29.720 wear is put a tag that is really really
02:27:31.960 difficult to take off because what
02:27:33.479 people would do is buy ethnic wear you
02:27:35.960 know you would then um uh go for the
02:27:38.920 wedding go for the occasion and then
02:27:41.000 return it right because you have a
02:27:41.800 15-day or a 30-day return policy right
02:27:43.880 so you so should we say here that there
02:27:46.200 are so many Savvy scamsters out there if
02:27:49.080 you're building a Brand 0 to1 in
02:27:51.120 cosmetics fashion shoes
02:27:54.319 whatever be really careful with forming
02:27:57.600 a returns policy CU you will likely get
02:27:59.880 scammed not at all I think n it's it's
02:28:02.760 very small by I was just saying that NE
02:28:06.479 in fashion specifically necessarily
02:28:08.359 these are not scamsters a large majority
02:28:10.840 of people just believe in buying three
02:28:13.160 options trying one of them and then
02:28:15.279 returning of them
02:28:17.399 talk about two different things two
02:28:18.960 different no but my sense by the way is
02:28:20.439 firstly if you're starting a new brand
02:28:22.600 unless it's a very high-end brand I
02:28:24.840 would not worry about doing fakes and
02:28:27.439 Returns the reason is you're not a Nike
02:28:29.720 The Reason by the way they're doing some
02:28:30.960 of that is because it's a Nike shoe
02:28:32.520 right you know if it's Brand X or brand
02:28:34.319 y they're not going to do it so I would
02:28:35.520 not worry however can I just reframe it
02:28:38.160 I think you should worry about fit and
02:28:40.040 return percentages if you are in fashion
02:28:42.319 what is the fit in return so um in
02:28:44.720 fashion in Beauty and everywhere in
02:28:47.359 e-commerce there are returns it's the
02:28:49.080 nature it's a it's a shopping feature
02:28:50.920 because you don't touch and see returns
02:28:53.399 actually can change the economics of a
02:28:55.000 business because if you have 30% 35%
02:28:57.840 coming back you pay for the reverse
02:28:59.720 Logistics the inventory gets stuck Etc
02:29:02.600 so as you think about launching a new
02:29:04.120 product getting your fit right and
02:29:06.359 communicating that fit through an image
02:29:09.359 is again a very important thing because
02:29:11.279 otherwise what happens is you launch a
02:29:12.560 product and you find that it's sold very
02:29:14.680 well month two by the way 50% comes back
02:29:17.960 you have a real problem so I think
02:29:19.520 getting the fit right is important so
02:29:21.359 next we'll go
02:29:22.920 into Raj's insights from building Brands
02:29:27.920 around influencers unfortunately we
02:29:30.600 missed the boat and we only got 1% or
02:29:32.880 something in This brilliant company he's
02:29:34.800 building yeah and now he's raising a
02:29:36.880 round which is three times as big as the
02:29:38.640 last one so we can't afford it anyway
02:29:41.439 but uh maybe you tell us some insights
02:29:44.560 around the influencer piece and how to
02:29:47.160 build Brands around
02:29:49.520 content and distribution which is
02:29:52.680 individualistic in nature so I'll tell
02:29:55.080 you I don't think V say brand building
02:29:58.000 is different in offline world or a
02:30:00.520 digital first or a social first brand
02:30:02.200 building fundamentals are same okay I
02:30:04.720 just feel that every time a new
02:30:06.680 generation of buyers come there's a
02:30:08.560 layer to be added yeah so the first set
02:30:11.439 of Brands were built on
02:30:13.240 function okay the second set of Brands
02:30:16.160 were built on emotion mhm now so
02:30:19.120 function plus emotion right now I think
02:30:21.359 the brands are going to be built on
02:30:22.479 function emotion and community so that's
02:30:25.000 what we were talking about so that's the
02:30:26.640 basic Insight of what we're trying to do
02:30:28.680 right so to give it
02:30:31.200 more in like to simplify it better like
02:30:34.560 my product needs to be better than all
02:30:36.279 the other products or has to be some
02:30:38.000 differentiative distinctive value it has
02:30:40.760 to stand for certain level of emotion
02:30:42.960 for example let's say Red Bull is
02:30:45.479 Adventure okay so that's an emotion that
02:30:48.000 you appeal to an emotion so is your
02:30:49.399 brand becoming an emotion right I keep
02:30:51.319 giving Red Bull example because it's the
02:30:52.560 most common one y and then I think the
02:30:55.160 third layer which is getting added is
02:30:57.080 the attention and the community part so
02:30:59.720 if you don't have the community of
02:31:01.479 people who can who are technically
02:31:05.080 acting as evangelists for you it's it
02:31:08.439 gets very difficult Beyond a point to
02:31:10.040 build a brand and to scale it mhm so
02:31:12.040 that's like to mix all of these three
02:31:14.040 that's where the influencer comes in
02:31:15.279 pcture so so we as a company we crack
02:31:18.080 function and emotion for a product and
02:31:20.640 then we take on influencers attention
02:31:22.479 and Community Building uh ability and
02:31:25.319 their Community to mix all of these
02:31:26.920 three thing together so that's how I
02:31:28.560 think the brands of the future are going
02:31:29.960 to be built it's already happening
02:31:32.240 around us where Prime drinks we saw you
02:31:35.399 guys know Prime drinks right in a year
02:31:37.640 $250 million sales then same thing
02:31:40.840 happened with Mr be's Feasta bills which
02:31:42.680 is now I think declining a bit yeah then
02:31:45.880 what is working for say Fenty Beauty Mr
02:31:48.840 Beast these guys but is not working for
02:31:53.520 say for example Bollywood cuz none of
02:31:55.640 the brands propagated by Bollywood seem
02:31:58.640 to be working okay here's what I feel I
02:32:01.080 can't say at large celebrities around
02:32:02.880 the world I can take talk about two
02:32:05.080 problems which I see with Bollywood
02:32:06.399 celebrity Le problem in India first
02:32:10.160 authenticity okay so I was just telling
02:32:12.120 you about a stat that genzies believe in
02:32:15.040 advertising they're okay with it they
02:32:16.680 trust seven out of 10 genzies believe in
02:32:18.520 influencer marketing as well yeah
02:32:20.160 they're fine but if as an influencer I'm
02:32:23.479 telling them and trying to organically
02:32:25.040 push it by not disclosing that this is
02:32:26.760 an advertised product they don't believe
02:32:28.240 it they in fact there's a cancel culture
02:32:31.319 going on they're
02:32:32.840 like right so you have to be very honest
02:32:35.399 about it so that's the first thing so I
02:32:38.359 think with Bollywood celebrities and
02:32:40.040 stuff the authenticity is not getting
02:32:41.680 built that's the first second so is
02:32:44.640 there not there is example by the way my
02:32:47.920 I'll just add to this and like why I
02:32:49.960 believe this thing yeah the second and
02:32:52.080 the most important thing in India
02:32:54.760 specifically few Bollywood brands that
02:32:56.319 have started one day they come up like
02:32:58.760 and be like hey this is my brand use it
02:33:02.359 there's no backstory and actor is
02:33:04.040 changing every year as per their roles
02:33:06.080 and the St the the storytelling that
02:33:07.720 they're doing right there's no certain
02:33:09.319 level of values which are getting built
02:33:10.760 over the years with an influencer for
02:33:12.640 five years they're building on one value
02:33:14.120 but is does that mean cricketer Brands
02:33:15.640 work so cricketer Brands work because
02:33:18.720 they only have one value but which
02:33:20.359 cricketer brand is really working in
02:33:21.840 India leave verat kohy and Puma I think
02:33:24.479 by the way that's not his brand it's a
02:33:26.080 endorsement but I think by the way for
02:33:27.720 me the most interesting one I mean it's
02:33:30.000 still playing out but hrx HX is by the
02:33:32.680 way something that we but that's an
02:33:35.640 outlier by the way that's true to
02:33:37.279 community then no it's very true it's
02:33:39.160 and it's completely true what you said
02:33:40.680 right which is it's consistent with
02:33:41.920 Ric's personality as well I think he
02:33:43.560 genuinely believes in Fitness but can I
02:33:44.960 ask you a question yeah TIG sh
02:33:47.760 started Why didn't it work yeah um but
02:33:51.520 tiger is more India
02:33:53.800 too yeah yeah yeah and uh that's why I
02:33:58.560 think Rik is India one still sorry
02:34:01.000 that's one I think the other thing also
02:34:02.359 is I think Rik by the way it was India
02:34:03.840 one was consistent also picked the right
02:34:06.520 platform and partner and the right
02:34:07.800 product also I was coming to thect and
02:34:10.240 platform both were very good I mean and
02:34:12.120 you you had the distribution and the
02:34:13.399 reach also correct correct correct
02:34:14.680 correct also I believe that
02:34:17.040 The Simple Theory which I I think I I
02:34:19.479 always see a celebrity making a wrong
02:34:21.279 frit between the cohort of the customers
02:34:24.960 can I derive on that thought and ask you
02:34:27.040 which celebrity should create what kind
02:34:28.600 of a brand one or two examples R ranir
02:34:32.120 Singh protein should build an energy
02:34:35.279 drink energy energy energy energy
02:34:38.080 protein anything energy energy I think
02:34:40.279 would be the one I think ran Singh can
02:34:41.800 also pull off a sexual Wellness brand
02:34:43.319 very well yeah which he's also doing I
02:34:44.880 think right he's doing that
02:34:46.920 what should I sell if I were a brand
02:34:48.279 what would I
02:34:49.840 sell this is interesting you wouldn't
02:34:52.000 tell me the truth otherwise so tell
02:34:53.880 quite
02:34:55.359 luxury white
02:34:57.640 luxury so every every Star would have
02:35:01.240 some value system some values which one
02:35:04.200 has to as a brand like Katrina has built
02:35:07.080 a beauty brand has that done well though
02:35:09.680 that's not done badly that's done well
02:35:11.439 actually naika eventually bought it the
02:35:14.200 products are also good by the that's
02:35:15.680 doing well yeah what happened to I don't
02:35:18.160 know how well it is doing I think it is
02:35:20.359 overpriced a little it's very early days
02:35:22.040 also I it's also high as I don't think
02:35:24.240 it's doing well it's overpriced don't
02:35:26.520 know but the price points are very high
02:35:27.880 thepa and anant are
02:35:29.960 friends so he'll defend no I mean if the
02:35:33.439 product is good more power to her to be
02:35:35.240 successful right I don't know if it's
02:35:37.040 successful or not can I also add
02:35:38.640 something I think what we was saying all
02:35:40.760 three of us in the beginning you need to
02:35:42.560 have a differentiative product in the
02:35:43.960 beginning so even if you're celebrity
02:35:45.439 you can't come with a no no agree fully
02:35:48.439 so I was telling you it's easier to
02:35:50.439 build an addition category than a
02:35:52.000 replacement category and L of
02:35:54.120 celebrities have done like in
02:35:55.279 replacement replacement replacement
02:35:57.160 category doesn't can can you broaden
02:35:59.080 that thought what is addition so it's
02:36:01.560 like let's say if I am I love skincare
02:36:05.279 routines I have already a three-step
02:36:07.080 skincare routine I buy let's say a face
02:36:09.359 wash a cream and a sunscreen I should
02:36:12.640 like somebody should not sell sunscreen
02:36:14.399 to me somebody should sell one added
02:36:17.319 product not try to replace what I
02:36:19.080 existing believe in what could that be
02:36:21.240 so that could be let's say scrub on 15
02:36:23.120 days once in 15 days that could be a
02:36:25.200 night cream that could be a serum before
02:36:27.279 I apply my my moisturizer and how does
02:36:29.960 somebody build the need for a product
02:36:32.800 outside of the three so that's what he
02:36:34.319 said long-term keyword like longtail
02:36:36.720 keywords you try to find out you also
02:36:38.439 try to do the Google search where you
02:36:40.479 try to see search volume watch
02:36:41.800 categories are growing up and then you
02:36:43.359 try to find out products where there are
02:36:44.720 not enough products where you can build
02:36:46.120 a category so if already there's
02:36:49.080 something existing at large which is
02:36:50.840 destroyed with you with your community
02:36:52.800 and attention are going to tackle on the
02:36:54.399 same thing I think there are higher
02:36:55.600 chances of failing the other thing that
02:36:58.120 I think celebrity Le Brands need to be
02:37:00.880 thoughtful about is how do you get the
02:37:03.760 product right see I'll tell you all of
02:37:06.479 the detailed assortment planning price
02:37:08.600 planning for HX was all done by the MRA
02:37:12.040 private branding right at some level I
02:37:13.880 mean it's a joint it's a collaboration
02:37:15.399 and so on
02:37:16.520 but I think you should not
02:37:19.040 confuse your values and what you want to
02:37:21.680 stand for with product expertise they're
02:37:24.680 two very different things was that at
02:37:26.520 your time HX yes did you work on it like
02:37:29.160 with him yeah yeah I mean I think it see
02:37:31.520 I'll tell you I think the first is
02:37:32.840 atleisure as a space was growing
02:37:35.560 category yeah was a category that I
02:37:37.200 think was a good bet on second it was
02:37:39.520 very consistent with them third in India
02:37:42.279 by the way you have Puma rebok Nike
02:37:45.840 Adidas and then nothing right so this
02:37:48.760 was at 50% of the price point and
02:37:50.840 therefore very affordable applies to
02:37:53.560 India one I mean it wasn't an India 2
02:37:55.560 product India one product but it was a
02:37:58.439 differentiated offering in a growth
02:38:00.040 market and it made athia accessible to
02:38:03.040 many and they didn't overuse rtic also
02:38:06.520 so he was not shouting the No No you're
02:38:08.439 not shouting from the top I have a
02:38:09.760 question for you okay what watch are you
02:38:13.120 wearing watch watch yeah car car car I
02:38:17.040 don't know how to pronce okay what shoe
02:38:18.160 are you
02:38:19.560 wearing Jordans what t-shirt are you
02:38:22.560 wearing t-shirt is census there's a
02:38:25.640 there's a small brand what cell phone
02:38:27.760 are you using iPhone what uh trousers
02:38:31.520 are you wearing it's a tailor made
02:38:34.040 trouser why if I were to sum up your
02:38:37.640 consumption what car do you drive BMW if
02:38:41.319 I were to sum up his consumption his
02:38:43.600 consumption is dramatically greater than
02:38:45.120 mine I think it's the one conclusion I
02:38:47.200 come to you're you're signaling right
02:38:48.560 now but that's okay yeah that's exact we
02:38:50.520 know about your wine collection now
02:38:51.880 let's not go there what you're signaling
02:38:54.359 it's a problem I thought it hit bangalor
02:38:56.640 less than other cities but it seems to
02:38:58.120 be coming here but why
02:39:02.359 is why is why are indian-made Brands
02:39:06.279 such a small component of you so this is
02:39:09.800 Indian this is Indian these are only two
02:39:11.319 things yeah but out of the 50 lakhs of
02:39:13.760 spend you told me you're summing up for,
02:39:16.319 rupees including your car I tell you
02:39:20.880 correct I on the fun side I'll tell you
02:39:23.000 the shoes and the watch is given by my
02:39:24.640 brother so let's just put it that but
02:39:27.240 like coming to the part but I'm guessing
02:39:28.520 you're not wearing b b actually
02:39:31.479 ATT that's not even IND yeah but why is
02:39:35.080 that you so I think uh I tell
02:39:40.279 you the major reason is because we've
02:39:42.880 not been exposed by the brands to to
02:39:45.760 build a signal value which are Indian
02:39:48.120 made okay so give you an example yeah so
02:39:52.720 something let's say so I'm in that phase
02:39:55.760 where right now I'm just making money I
02:39:57.760 want to show off my preferences and
02:40:00.439 choices I want to put you know what I
02:40:02.359 love about what he's saying is unlike so
02:40:05.000 many other people I've spoken to he's
02:40:06.800 not virtue signaling it's a beautiful
02:40:09.200 quality like he didn't evade the
02:40:11.520 question that he drives a BMW I think
02:40:13.479 it's it's such a thing that should be
02:40:15.640 appreciate it like you did a little bit
02:40:17.479 and he did not I think it's I'm Tam Bram
02:40:20.760 I think there was some you know it may
02:40:22.920 not be virtual signaling yeah I think
02:40:24.399 it's such a disservice to society where
02:40:27.359 people pretend to be Saints and I'll
02:40:29.359 tell you this the people who pretend to
02:40:31.040 be most saintly are the most immoral of
02:40:34.200 them all I'm not talking about you I'm
02:40:35.880 talking societ I I think by the way you
02:40:38.640 know I think you have a little bit of
02:40:41.040 what actually signaling is which seems
02:40:43.080 to impact a little bit more I don't
02:40:44.800 think it's as serious
02:40:46.399 right I think it's a casual thing I
02:40:48.520 think people behave very differently I
02:40:51.520 think uh exercising too much importance
02:40:55.240 to signaling of various kinds is also a
02:40:58.399 problem right I think that's also a
02:41:00.560 reverse problem this is signaling this
02:41:02.319 is mainstream now like whatever you're
02:41:04.080 doing in life if it's you I think that
02:41:06.200 is I I I developed a philosophy which
02:41:08.560 has worked very well with me is whatever
02:41:11.080 you do in life the heart and the mind
02:41:12.800 has to converge yeah yeah and I have no
02:41:15.960 problems with anything ever yeah I I by
02:41:18.920 the way fully I mean it's hard to not
02:41:20.760 agree I think right with some of this
02:41:22.520 but I think my point is you do what you
02:41:24.720 feel comfortable with I don't think you
02:41:27.399 should judge signaling reverse signaling
02:41:30.120 or any of it I to each their own the
02:41:33.080 question is are you doing what learning
02:41:35.680 about your personality and that will
02:41:37.760 reflect on your behavior and your
02:41:39.200 actions yeah and I'm saying that's okay
02:41:41.120 right knowing a personality type it
02:41:42.880 doesn't mean by the way that you I think
02:41:44.840 you should absolutely own what you
02:41:47.920 are but I think it is okay to have very
02:41:50.600 different what you are oh yeah right I
02:41:52.880 think that's the point I'm tring which
02:41:54.040 is fine but the
02:41:55.319 question underneath this all is are you
02:41:58.960 what you are are you signaling what you
02:42:01.040 are or are you trying to be what you
02:42:04.680 think you should be and that in itself
02:42:06.760 is a signal yeah I think uh it's a very
02:42:09.880 difficult sort of complicated question
02:42:11.760 but my my answer by the way is actually
02:42:13.800 quite simple I actually believe that
02:42:17.319 whatever I feel comfortable with I do I
02:42:20.319 don't particularly need to sort of be
02:42:23.439 contrarian in order to sort of prove a
02:42:25.720 point either right I mean just to put
02:42:29.279 this in perspective right I mean just
02:42:31.000 because you don't have consumption in
02:42:32.920 one way doesn't mean you don't consume
02:42:34.399 in another way I mean we to each our own
02:42:37.279 right yeah you you consum in wine and
02:42:40.520 not yeah each of us does it in our own
02:42:42.560 way right and I think you what you enjoy
02:42:44.279 I have a like like I always believe that
02:42:46.920 I am what I am inside outside I have
02:42:49.200 always been the same but the other side
02:42:50.760 of the spectrum the people who are
02:42:52.600 judging you don't look at you that way a
02:42:54.680 lot of people misread me yeah because
02:42:58.960 people believe you are pretentious you
02:43:00.680 have something else and I have faced
02:43:03.800 these issues quite a lot you know this
02:43:05.439 is something I'm only realizing for
02:43:07.319 myself now I spent the vast majority of
02:43:10.040 my life pretending to be something I
02:43:12.960 thought I should be by virtue of my peer
02:43:15.960 group Society the people I looked up to
02:43:18.439 all of that I'm not there yet but I
02:43:21.240 think I'm I've started being a lot more
02:43:23.920 authentic in life and it's so refreshing
02:43:26.359 if somebody ask me like questions right
02:43:28.120 I'm like yeah that is me now am I
02:43:29.920 hurting you if I'm not hurting you it's
02:43:31.439 my
02:43:32.200 business yeah yeah as long as I'm being
02:43:34.640 true to me no no agree secondly maybe
02:43:37.359 when I was much younger I used to be
02:43:39.240 judgmental if he's like this he has to
02:43:41.399 be like this ter stereotype but I think
02:43:43.520 now I'm totally out judgment I don't
02:43:45.920 judge
02:43:46.680 anybody by whatever he's wearing or
02:43:49.760 whatever he's he a to say something I
02:43:51.680 can see I can see the lips Mo but the
02:43:53.800 sound not coming up no no no no I I I
02:43:56.439 agree a bit with Kish I I still find
02:43:58.760 myself judging too much yeah and I think
02:44:01.640 you have to consciously avoid it I think
02:44:03.200 you I was a lot judgmental crazy okay
02:44:06.680 got it it and I feel like that's the
02:44:08.279 thing to inculcate and encourage people
02:44:10.160 to do is stop judging yeah yeah agree
02:44:12.479 everybody like you know agree
02:44:14.720 everybody's constantly judging and
02:44:16.279 taking joy and pulling other people down
02:44:18.080 or
02:44:19.240 like you have opinion great but you know
02:44:22.359 yeah yeah but I think and the other
02:44:23.720 thing I like what you mentioned which is
02:44:24.960 you do whatever you want as long as it
02:44:26.120 doesn't hurt someone else don't care
02:44:28.479 right I mean if you're causing harm then
02:44:30.120 it's different but otherwise I think it
02:44:31.520 shouldn't matter interesting thought
02:44:34.000 coming back to Raj okay sorry for
02:44:37.200 digressing continue what was that
02:44:39.200 telling you were talking about different
02:44:41.800 Indian Brands right so we
02:44:45.720 as I tell you
02:44:47.479 okay what was cool for us till now okay
02:44:51.960 as I was growing up American movies
02:44:54.560 American sports stars and American
02:44:56.680 brands because they were limited they
02:44:58.640 were not accessible they were like you
02:45:01.200 know you don't see all of your friends
02:45:03.359 wearing Jordan at one point you don't
02:45:05.319 see all everybody driving German cars
02:45:07.880 everybody wearing a certain level of
02:45:10.240 let's say European watches and stuff
02:45:12.600 like that but you can't say that I can
02:45:14.040 say that no actually I can't see that
02:45:15.760 Kishore can say that we saw the world
02:45:18.120 kind of come out of socialism hyen
02:45:21.399 communism being cool to becoming uncool
02:45:24.640 Russians can say that the Chinese can
02:45:26.800 say that because they were oppressed for
02:45:28.399 a certain amount of time and they're
02:45:29.840 overcompensating for a period of time
02:45:32.279 but I think India largely has been open
02:45:34.040 since the '90s right I tell you more
02:45:36.200 than '90s is like the where I've been
02:45:37.479 born and brought up oh my city my
02:45:40.600 neighborhood got it there was I don't
02:45:43.200 remember in like 300 houses in my my
02:45:45.240 Colony there even one guy had like a BMW
02:45:48.040 I remember when we were growing up in my
02:45:50.520 school I was the coolest guy in 12th
02:45:53.359 class that's 12th when I bought a fast
02:45:56.279 track so because I come from that I'm
02:45:58.800 not talking about larger India I'm just
02:46:01.080 talking about my upbringing in a way I
02:46:02.439 came up we used to look at other people
02:46:04.760 and then as my so now my brother started
02:46:07.720 going my brother studied in UK so I was
02:46:10.760 I didn't study there he studied there so
02:46:12.800 he got exposed to all of this and then
02:46:15.120 he started getting exposed to all of
02:46:16.319 this and he started telling us about all
02:46:17.840 of these things I started following I
02:46:19.439 started finding now these little things
02:46:21.319 online and I was like Wow even I Like It
02:46:23.760 by I think there's an opportunity since
02:46:25.200 we're talking about brands in Indian
02:46:27.080 luxury I think uh you know five years I
02:46:29.840 would prefer an Indian luxury I think
02:46:31.399 there is yeah and I think there is me
02:46:35.120 ethnic or do you mean no no I think
02:46:37.000 Indian luxury I don't mean ethnic right
02:46:39.040 I think there's an opportunity for
02:46:40.479 handcrafting for luxury um I think
02:46:44.000 across a range of C atories I think you
02:46:46.560 know 5 years ago 7even years ago I would
02:46:48.560 have said no but I think now there's a
02:46:50.680 lot of meaning people want to actually
02:46:52.279 have some sense of origin in place I
02:46:54.640 don't think you can build a very large
02:46:56.040 business may but I think you can
02:46:57.240 certainly build a very interesting brand
02:46:59.840 I and would you say somebody should sell
02:47:01.520 that through the lens of patriotism CU
02:47:03.399 that could work it could work I don't I
02:47:05.279 don't know about patriotism no I think
02:47:06.880 luxury you should not sell with
02:47:08.640 patriotism not at all but I think
02:47:10.399 Artisans and all that you can do I don't
02:47:12.399 knowm or not but Artis also very diff
02:47:15.399 but artisan and storytelling is now
02:47:17.040 you're supporting a larger cause not
02:47:18.960 patriotismo is like a very very
02:47:21.080 different uh emotion no but you're
02:47:23.520 saying Made in India right is that
02:47:25.359 something that I think I think the first
02:47:26.960 brand which is being built in luxury is
02:47:28.960 sabya yeah and if you look at the new
02:47:31.960 store Ultra he owned a culture I think
02:47:34.840 it's very interesting I think so because
02:47:37.240 he owned culture no no and I think he's
02:47:39.520 taken a global I mean the New York store
02:47:41.439 I mean it's like quite interesting so I
02:47:43.040 think there is an opportunity here for
02:47:44.279 sure but that's ethnic I'm talking about
02:47:47.120 but he's doing a lot of uh other
02:47:49.240 products also if you look at his bags
02:47:51.000 also think so yeah jewelry I think see I
02:47:53.600 think there's a I mean but there is a
02:47:54.840 story there so all of these Brands if
02:47:56.840 you look at luxury Brands they built
02:47:58.200 around culture if you pick on that
02:48:00.000 culture and then sell a story it SS okay
02:48:02.240 influencer Brands what else to keep in
02:48:03.960 mind say I'm starting a brand in
02:48:06.479 cosmetics I want to partner with say
02:48:11.000 actor X Y whatever what should I look
02:48:15.160 look out for in the actor which should
02:48:17.000 resonate with the product I'm building
02:48:18.560 and how do I go about it what do I watch
02:48:20.279 out for what will work for me first you
02:48:22.520 have to okay so write down so you have
02:48:24.920 completely escaped the c y category y
02:48:27.359 product you've chosen that no tell me
02:48:29.200 that was so first you said why you it
02:48:31.720 has to be additional it can't be
02:48:33.920 replacement it can't be at a price lower
02:48:37.080 than what is available in the market
02:48:38.720 right now it has to be at a slightly
02:48:41.000 higher price because it has to feel like
02:48:42.640 upgrade yes what else so apart from that
02:48:45.640 now how you go about choosing a
02:48:47.000 celebrity or an influencer I think first
02:48:49.880 you should choose people who are at the
02:48:51.240 Tipping Point not really big not small
02:48:54.080 because if you build like if you build
02:48:55.760 with number one yeah there's no way
02:48:57.600 going up like it's just there's someone
02:48:59.960 number two number three number five
02:49:01.359 waiting to replace that right right so
02:49:03.279 for example if you want to build with
02:49:05.479 verat kohley I don't think this is the
02:49:07.000 right time it was like he's already he's
02:49:08.560 already at a peak I think you should
02:49:10.080 build it with someone this is my theory
02:49:11.359 it can be shill kind of guy you should
02:49:14.000 build it with that y because they are on
02:49:15.600 a Tipping Point so you're betting for
02:49:18.279 because as they grow your brand will
02:49:20.319 also grow is there a number you can
02:49:22.319 attach to social media influence let's
02:49:24.800 say for example Virat kohi has 100
02:49:27.760 million followers on Instagram more than
02:49:30.479 number I would say so okay don't go with
02:49:33.160 anyone who's under million let's just
02:49:35.319 see put that okay right if you want to
02:49:37.279 build it but more than that what really
02:49:39.800 matters is do they have a potential to
02:49:42.000 go to let's say 50 million or 20 million
02:49:44.720 or 15 million doesn't matter you catch
02:49:46.680 them at 1 million or 5 million or 8
02:49:48.160 million do they have potential to go 10x
02:49:50.880 from here is the question that you
02:49:52.560 should be asking and how do you gauge
02:49:53.680 that so there are couple of signs one is
02:49:56.520 Tipping Point based on how fast they
02:49:58.160 have gotten to where they' have gotten
02:50:00.000 second is is there a signs of repeating
02:50:02.120 what they're doing so for example let's
02:50:03.880 say pick up a musician or an artist
02:50:06.239 right if somebody's like hey I sing from
02:50:08.000 my soul and heart and I do this you know
02:50:10.920 that you have to go deeper and talk to
02:50:12.399 this guy like at a certain level to
02:50:14.040 figure out because soul and heart is not
02:50:15.720 going to work for long right right it
02:50:17.520 definitely work you need to have that
02:50:19.560 eventually but does this guy understand
02:50:21.800 science behind spreading the music the
02:50:23.520 way it spreads example right that's the
02:50:26.080 so do they understand the science and
02:50:27.319 the craft of what they're doing so that
02:50:29.080 they can do it at scale with larger
02:50:30.479 people that's first thing that you
02:50:31.600 figure out second is are there
02:50:34.520 establishments pumping money on them so
02:50:37.760 for example if there's a musician think
02:50:40.760 are there global music brands or labels
02:50:43.399 putting massive money on them or no or
02:50:46.600 if there is like a mainstream YouTuber
02:50:48.800 are there larger consumer Brands who
02:50:50.680 have made them brand ambassadors or
02:50:52.840 putting money on them because what
02:50:54.560 happens these guys will like these
02:50:57.160 larger establishments will pump money
02:50:59.200 and make your small influencer larger
02:51:01.160 influencer put in up front so you don't
02:51:02.840 end up putting that much money on them
02:51:04.680 so that's the second and the most third
02:51:07.080 is the emotion that they stand for every
02:51:10.479 Creator every celebrity has some kind of
02:51:12.920 emotion in their in their PR story if
02:51:15.359 it's Shah ruk Khan It's like success
02:51:17.720 story and love if it's about let's say
02:51:20.359 talk about 10 gamers they're 10 gamers
02:51:21.920 playing 10 games and playing same games
02:51:24.399 at the same time but they all have
02:51:25.600 different communities because one would
02:51:27.359 stand for RX to Rich Story one would
02:51:29.200 stand for humor Story one would stand
02:51:31.279 for adventure and being just like a very
02:51:34.720 wild Creator so you need to catch on a
02:51:37.439 specific emotion and then map that
02:51:38.960 emotion with the brand that you're
02:51:40.000 creating so these are the first three
02:51:41.640 signs that you pick on before you choose
02:51:43.800 a celebrity
02:51:45.160 and then the fourth and the most
02:51:46.920 important thing which is
02:51:48.600 that do these Creator want to build
02:51:51.840 brand with you and they think that brand
02:51:55.279 is going to be as significant in their
02:51:57.239 life as their music career or their
02:51:59.439 influencer career is or not because if
02:52:02.359 they see you as somebody that hey I'm
02:52:03.840 going to treat it as a brand endorsement
02:52:06.439 I'll just come today and do it can you
02:52:08.640 can you summarize this for us I'm a new
02:52:11.720 guy creating a new brand I have 50 l
02:52:14.600 rupes to start a brand let's say
02:52:17.800 Cosmetics three main points I would look
02:52:21.200 to find the right partner who is a
02:52:23.120 popular person influencer first if
02:52:25.680 they're asking you for money don't work
02:52:27.080 with them okay only share equity and
02:52:29.399 only Equity right only Equity don't do
02:52:31.160 anything because if they're asking for
02:52:32.399 money they're te technically downsizing
02:52:34.439 their risk you don't want to work with
02:52:35.800 that partner pick them before they
02:52:37.640 become really popular yes okay pick them
02:52:39.560 before they're really popular third is
02:52:41.680 choose on the emotion like what are the
02:52:43.200 people talking about what is their
02:52:44.439 emotion what do they stand for what are
02:52:45.560 the certain level of pattern they've
02:52:47.000 built okay so if you look at Shah ruk
02:52:48.960 Khan he'll only play movies where he's
02:52:51.120 emotionally available for women that's
02:52:53.399 like a pattern that he's picked up
02:52:54.720 interesting right so everybody has this
02:52:57.080 pattern yeah that's third then the most
02:53:01.479 important thing that becomes really
02:53:03.680 important when you're working with an
02:53:05.279 influencer
02:53:06.840 is are there more people creating
02:53:09.600 content on them like are there enough
02:53:12.920 fan pages and community creating content
02:53:15.160 on them right if they are only creating
02:53:17.560 content and that's only getting out in
02:53:19.000 the world it's technically not that that
02:53:21.560 great of an influencer to work with
02:53:23.160 because you need people who announce
02:53:25.239 something who write about them so you
02:53:27.479 need someone who just talks about
02:53:29.560 something and then there are fan pages
02:53:31.160 and communities and other people to
02:53:32.840 create content on them they say you are
02:53:34.399 a great Creator right people create
02:53:36.560 content on you so that's a picking up on
02:53:39.160 that so you need to pick up on that and
02:53:40.800 I'll add the last layer of uh influencer
02:53:45.439 Leed
02:53:46.840 Brands can your
02:53:49.920 influencer organically create content
02:53:53.040 which doesn't look like sales around the
02:53:55.239 product that you're building with them
02:53:57.040 because if your creator has to come up
02:53:58.439 and be like hey buy my water bottle and
02:54:00.760 in their entire life they've never
02:54:01.880 talked about water or bottle yeah you to
02:54:04.680 be consistent it's just going to be it's
02:54:06.239 going to be bad yeah you know I I just
02:54:09.080 as an as on on topic on this I actually
02:54:12.160 once had the chance to meet Chris jenno
02:54:14.760 um and the Kardashians just during my
02:54:17.200 menra days you have a parallel life with
02:54:18.800 Thea and Kardashians and all that right
02:54:20.560 no no it's all businessman I mean I
02:54:22.680 don't have any time for socializing so
02:54:24.439 anyway I met met them um
02:54:27.520 pretentious signaling signaling not
02:54:30.040 pretentious um I'm I'm going to live
02:54:32.439 with my signaling and own my signaling
02:54:34.640 right um so uh it's very interesting I
02:54:37.880 think your fourth point or maybe the
02:54:40.279 third point was the most biggest thing I
02:54:43.279 think I don't think they did any of this
02:54:45.720 consistent y all of that but they knew
02:54:48.200 the engagement level of their followers
02:54:50.120 and they knew the number of followers
02:54:51.319 and they knew they wanted to build a
02:54:52.399 business that would last beond them I
02:54:54.200 don't know whether there's a certain
02:54:55.439 mindset of an influencer which I think
02:54:57.120 is perhaps the most important for
02:54:58.319 success I think you know for example a
02:55:00.680 Ric right wanted to build a legacy I
02:55:02.319 think wanted to build something I don't
02:55:03.359 know if that I mean maybe the equity
02:55:05.600 part is the part that sort of makes that
02:55:07.640 come alive but for me I think getting
02:55:09.560 that right more than anything else makes
02:55:12.319 this successful right I think that's why
02:55:13.600 they' built such large brand because you
02:55:15.279 need to understand your community right
02:55:16.840 because Kim Kardashian understood her
02:55:19.200 shape where was the most talked about
02:55:20.920 that's why she started understood her
02:55:23.479 lips were the biggest thing that was
02:55:25.840 Cosmetics each of them and the and how
02:55:27.680 do you how do you recognize these Trends
02:55:29.600 in the market like it's constantly
02:55:31.200 changing right like all these women were
02:55:33.680 very volumptuous at one point now
02:55:35.279 they're skinny like the needs and the
02:55:39.359 trends that sell in a market are
02:55:41.359 constantly changing so if I'm starting a
02:55:43.239 brand today how do I recognize that
02:55:45.600 Trend where do I look at it is it a top
02:55:47.840 down funnel should I look at the
02:55:48.960 Kardashians see what they're doing and
02:55:50.720 build a brand around that or would that
02:55:53.000 be ahead of its time I think we have to
02:55:56.600 keep our eyes and ears open and you have
02:55:58.080 to follow anything which is getting
02:55:59.560 popular I think so yeah and you'll
02:56:01.760 always find something or the other would
02:56:03.560 it be fair to say what the Kardashians
02:56:05.359 are doing now will be popular in India
02:56:07.080 in ex am of I don't I don't know I don't
02:56:10.239 think so right I eventually we didn't
02:56:11.640 bring them to India because I don't
02:56:12.840 think it actually appealed right so I
02:56:15.760 think it has to be local to your market
02:56:17.680 for sure the bief system is different
02:56:19.279 everywhere so I don't think like what
02:56:20.600 works there work right right any other
02:56:24.439 insights influencer please what else how
02:56:27.840 much Equity do you give them depends
02:56:30.720 like so we start at we start at 50 to
02:56:33.439 somewhere like around 10 to 20%
02:56:36.600 depending on the amount of time they no
02:56:38.640 no no depending on the category and the
02:56:40.800 investment which will be required for us
02:56:42.399 to build it versus what they bring on
02:56:43.800 table and they only put time no Capital
02:56:46.160 obviously they don't put Capital so they
02:56:48.560 share the but the sharing is on the
02:56:50.720 profit level not on any licensing any
02:56:53.120 royalty nothing else so there's no
02:56:54.520 percentage of Revenue that they get blah
02:56:56.319 blah blah Etc if the brand makes money
02:56:58.520 it makes money or you otherwise you
02:56:59.840 don't get okay he's done a perfume
02:57:02.319 cooker no perfume mixer and the third
02:57:04.880 one is no we're doing beauty Beauty and
02:57:07.239 each of those brands are selling two
02:57:08.880 cres no no not right now uh third brand
02:57:13.120 is getting launched in October what
02:57:15.439 first and two together they're doing
02:57:17.080 around 2
02:57:18.479 2.5 which is launched like 3 four months
02:57:20.600 ago yeah yeah we're very it's great but
02:57:22.720 I'm saying but but the interesting thing
02:57:24.359 is it's really when the brand makes
02:57:26.319 money you get some portion of the profit
02:57:28.000 not otherwise and you give them only
02:57:29.600 equity and this very tricky like we have
02:57:32.319 a fund around consumption and you know
02:57:34.840 it's called Collective gruh house and we
02:57:37.319 were looking at stats of popular people
02:57:39.960 who launched Brands yeah we were looking
02:57:42.160 at let me not name her but one very
02:57:44.520 popular actress with over 5050 million
02:57:46.880 followers who launched a certain brand
02:57:49.760 recently it only sold like a few
02:57:53.040 hundred so I don't think it's the
02:57:56.080 popularity that is key it is the
02:57:58.000 combination of all these factors
02:58:00.000 manactor plus there's a big thing versus
02:58:02.160 being known and being influ like you
02:58:04.000 have an influencing power versus being
02:58:05.359 known no no and that's one the second is
02:58:07.080 what I was earlier saying right I think
02:58:08.359 you have to separate Out product price
02:58:10.040 value proposition from influence I think
02:58:12.760 you cannot sell I mean even to India one
02:58:15.239 right I mean you cannot sell something
02:58:17.880 very what they don't want so I think
02:58:19.600 your assortment and this has to be left
02:58:21.200 to I wouldn't say professional but at
02:58:22.880 least some experts right so we had we
02:58:25.680 had we had a very interesting in our
02:58:29.279 earlier economy on WE us Sachin as a
02:58:31.720 brand ambassador yeah we created a brand
02:58:34.520 uh along but Sachin brand represented
02:58:37.040 his childhood and every mother or
02:58:39.000 parents wanted somebody to be like
02:58:40.399 suchin that was the brand Essence on
02:58:42.080 which we worked it didn't work as much
02:58:44.760 we worked with J hon Mar it worked
02:58:48.600 phenomenally well all the foreign stars
02:58:51.479 then we had dhoni I think that was just
02:58:54.200 phenomenal yeah and very early days when
02:58:56.520 he had long hairs which b b b we created
02:58:59.920 a whole Campaign which brand was this
02:59:01.439 fbb okay fashion big Bazar fashion baz
02:59:04.000 so we changed our name that time with
02:59:05.399 doni yeah and we continued with vun daan
02:59:08.960 right Katrina so it's been a journey but
02:59:12.160 M was uh not many misses we like we used
02:59:15.960 to take two stars one from the east or
02:59:19.040 east and one from the north so we used
02:59:21.680 beha right because in in India today to
02:59:25.200 launch a brand a d2c brand you need two
02:59:26.880 stars one from the south and one from
02:59:29.040 the north kishor's daughter is building
02:59:31.399 some incredible Brands would you like to
02:59:33.560 talk a little bit about it cuz people
02:59:35.160 watch look it up I I think they're in
02:59:37.120 the
02:59:37.920 journeying but would you like to see
02:59:39.800 like they are a company which they're
02:59:41.279 building is a venture Builder Okay so
02:59:43.279 they building Ventures 0 to one
02:59:45.040 everything is 0 to one and they build
02:59:47.080 around nine Ventures which is your two
02:59:49.680 favorites amongst the nine which are
02:59:51.479 your two I think there is a new one
02:59:53.000 which is coming up which is going to be
02:59:55.279 a new lifestyle space for the new age
02:59:58.399 Brands influencers creators it's a new
03:00:01.000 departmental store what is it called
03:00:02.920 it's going to be called Broadway oh so
03:00:05.720 it's a department it's a live theater
03:00:07.520 it's a FNB it's a supermarket it's a
03:00:09.200 beauty store how interesting experience
03:00:11.399 you can experience you can we are
03:00:14.040 starting live Commerce there yeah and uh
03:00:17.000 there's a makers lab you can show your
03:00:19.040 product is being made there is a Content
03:00:20.680 Studio everything is ticketed 10 events
03:00:23.080 a day big events there's definitely
03:00:25.200 opportunity for you two to collaborate
03:00:26.800 somewhere so that's the first to which
03:00:28.760 we are I think that's that's looking
03:00:31.359 second
03:00:32.359 favorite I think second favorite is uh
03:00:35.680 uh the smart sters as a brand Master as
03:00:39.279 a brand yeah because we went into
03:00:41.640 through furniture and now getting into
03:00:43.080 other categories and how do you go about
03:00:44.920 acquiring the client then I think the
03:00:47.680 same what physical digital all together
03:00:50.840 I don't believe in that theory of 0 to
03:00:52.319 20 20 to 50 50 to 100 I don't believe in
03:00:54.880 that theory I believe brand has to be
03:00:57.200 right the positioning has to be right
03:00:59.279 and uh you have to keep on acquiring
03:01:01.279 customers keep on learning on the way if
03:01:03.279 your brand is wrong nothing is going to
03:01:04.720 go right the one thing like I have a
03:01:07.120 point of contention on like by the time
03:01:09.120 this comes out this deal will probably
03:01:11.439 be done but we're doing blue stone
03:01:14.319 so like me ranan and sanjie bani are
03:01:17.279 doing it
03:01:18.520 together what worked incredibly well for
03:01:21.680 them is when they were online only they
03:01:24.279 plateaued at a certain point and they
03:01:25.840 had to get to offline too SC the minute
03:01:27.600 they went to offline yes they scaled by
03:01:30.680 a crazy Factor right work for blue stone
03:01:34.239 did not say for example work for
03:01:36.680 Nika Nika's stores did not work so can I
03:01:39.880 tell you the difference in my mind one
03:01:41.560 is a brand the other is a platform I
03:01:43.279 think they two very different things in
03:01:45.080 my view uh by the way I fundamentally
03:01:47.720 believe I think that more than 100
03:01:49.800 crores without offline it's very hard to
03:01:52.080 sort of build over time I think we've
03:01:53.600 talked about this earlier in the carrot
03:01:56.239 carrot Lane Blue Stone I think even more
03:01:57.920 important because the asps the price
03:01:59.800 points are very high therefore you need
03:02:02.040 even more I think um if you're a
03:02:05.040 platform and not a single brand then by
03:02:07.760 the way platforms work on traffic and
03:02:10.399 choice Brands by the way you're
03:02:12.520 establishing through this offline you're
03:02:14.239 establishing trust you're establishing
03:02:15.960 touch and feel can we talk about that a
03:02:17.800 little bit do platforms work today of
03:02:20.640 course they do yeah of course they do I
03:02:22.520 mean minra naika Amazon all are
03:02:25.160 platforms right they of course they work
03:02:27.399 they aggregate what do platforms do
03:02:29.600 they've spent money to aggregate traffic
03:02:31.920 and their brand stands for something
03:02:34.399 mintra I you know is is great brands at
03:02:37.760 great prices right Nika I think is
03:02:40.720 around Beauty and now of course
03:02:42.359 extending into other categories like
03:02:43.760 fashion Etc but I think they've
03:02:45.920 established a loyal set of customers who
03:02:49.160 keep coming back regularly for Choice
03:02:51.880 okay if I were to if I were to switch it
03:02:53.680 up we spoke about 0o to one if you're
03:02:56.359 creating a brand if you're a investor
03:02:59.120 looking at platforms how would you value
03:03:00.960 them multiple wise would you look at gmv
03:03:03.080 would you look at sales sales net sales
03:03:08.040 and how what multiple would you
03:03:10.080 attribute again depends on the category
03:03:12.560 and the profitability a lot of them are
03:03:14.760 going so broad that they all are
03:03:16.160 becoming the same no no no I think
03:03:17.880 there's a vertical versus a horizontal
03:03:19.520 right I mean verticals are people who
03:03:21.120 focus on one sector versus not right see
03:03:24.359 look I mean I think eventually the
03:03:26.399 question is can you make a ton of money
03:03:27.840 I mean I think you know you can't get
03:03:29.160 away from free cash flows right at some
03:03:31.359 level so the question that you have to
03:03:33.359 believe at some level for a platform is
03:03:35.479 at what percentage market share can you
03:03:38.239 start to make real money M right and
03:03:40.760 that varies right in Amazon in the US it
03:03:42.680 took 20 years or whatever I forget the
03:03:44.120 exact number of years before it started
03:03:46.040 generating money so I think that's how
03:03:47.880 you'll start to have to Value I think
03:03:49.040 it's a little bit more not your current
03:03:52.239 cash flows it has to be some projection
03:03:54.200 of future cashow even if you were to
03:03:55.239 leave cash flows cuz very few of them
03:03:56.840 have positive cash flows if you were to
03:03:59.040 look at a net sales multiple would you
03:04:00.880 say like we discussed earlier you said
03:04:04.160 for 4 to 6X is what roughly the range
03:04:07.000 for Beauty and Fashion forat no no not
03:04:09.479 for platforms I'm saying this was we
03:04:10.720 discussed for Brands yeah obviously do
03:04:12.920 you think o DC kind of things are a
03:04:14.600 threat to platforms no I think ondc can
03:04:17.920 be maybe in the long I think they're not
03:04:19.920 a threat to platforms I think they can
03:04:22.479 unlock smaller players in terms of
03:04:25.479 selling right smaller brands in terms of
03:04:27.800 selling because it allows you to have
03:04:29.800 direct access what has a platform done
03:04:32.239 platform has spent all its money on
03:04:33.680 traffic and brand right onc doesn't
03:04:36.560 solve the problem onc disaggregates the
03:04:39.040 different parts of e-commerce right I
03:04:41.359 think it's very useful I do think o n DC
03:04:44.080 can add value to Brands I'm not sure
03:04:46.520 there are replacement to platforms what
03:04:48.960 I think will happen if you were to ask
03:04:50.640 me like I no expert in this field
03:04:52.800 interesting to hear I think the margins
03:04:55.000 like when I value a platform
03:04:56.960 play onc I think will drive down the
03:04:59.760 margins of platforms considerably got it
03:05:03.439 cuz I might not take the Arbitrage if
03:05:05.319 the price difference is 5% but if the
03:05:08.800 price difference is paying 30% on flip
03:05:11.760 cart versus 5% on n DC I think a lot of
03:05:14.960 people by virtual word of mouth will go
03:05:16.880 for it and another very like Cardinal
03:05:19.880 question I missed is different platforms
03:05:23.239 have different business models like
03:05:24.680 Amazon has a warehouse where they'll
03:05:26.319 stock and then Supply and all of that
03:05:29.680 let's say for example uh Nika has a
03:05:32.560 different one Flipkart has a different
03:05:34.040 one what model is working today and what
03:05:36.399 will work tomorrow so there are sort of
03:05:39.399 fundamentally two models just to
03:05:41.200 simplify this I maybe I'll take this as
03:05:42.800 as an e platform question um one is
03:05:46.000 what's called a pure play marketplace
03:05:47.840 right a pure play Marketplace purely
03:05:50.200 connects buyers and sellers the
03:05:52.000 inventory sits with the brand and the
03:05:53.840 brand ships it out to the customer
03:05:55.560 that's one model yeah the other model is
03:05:59.000 what is called fulfilled by the platform
03:06:00.920 you can have fulfilled by Amazon
03:06:02.080 fulfilled by flip cart Etc there the
03:06:04.279 inventory physically sits in a Flipkart
03:06:06.439 Warehouse or a mintra warehouse or an
03:06:08.640 Amazon warehouse right these are the
03:06:10.439 broadly the two different
03:06:11.880 models what works well for what depends
03:06:14.600 on volume and value if you're selling
03:06:17.200 gardening equipment or if you're selling
03:06:18.920 anything which is bulky then going
03:06:21.359 through an Amazon or a Flipkart model
03:06:23.000 where it's in their warehouse is always
03:06:24.840 cheaper because they can get it to all
03:06:26.279 parts of India they can get it to you
03:06:27.600 faster Etc if you're selling a fashion
03:06:30.000 product maybe doing a pure play
03:06:31.720 Marketplace from your own is fine
03:06:33.080 because you can still get it to them it
03:06:34.520 doesn't cost you that much more so it's
03:06:35.840 purely economics driven I think in my
03:06:38.200 mind so it's volume value ratio
03:06:40.600 right if you had 1 CR RUP
03:06:44.399 and you had to build a brand today I'm
03:06:46.080 going to go through each one of you what
03:06:48.760 would you do where do you see the
03:06:50.160 opportunity how would you do it like
03:06:51.840 give me a 30 second answer can you start
03:06:53.920 from them I want to know they like would
03:06:56.399 you like like uh my background has been
03:06:59.160 clothing and all other categories I
03:07:01.600 would I would look at opportunity in two
03:07:03.680 places one is household
03:07:05.319 wees uh to create a brand out there
03:07:07.760 household we be home decor not home
03:07:10.200 decor I would say anything which goes
03:07:11.479 into home the cutlery the Crockery
03:07:13.880 and
03:07:15.600 household I think that's a interesting
03:07:18.399 product category which I people keep the
03:07:21.520 they buy quite often in a way that uh
03:07:23.640 there are new designs which can be
03:07:24.800 created you can enter this Market easily
03:07:27.040 through new design sensibilities or
03:07:28.840 through something else another thing
03:07:30.720 which I would do will be in
03:07:33.319 fashion try to do at least 10 12 stock
03:07:36.000 tons in whatever you design towards if
03:07:39.520 figure your differentiation what would
03:07:40.920 it be like uh maybe a a single
03:07:44.399 color a brand which only does one color
03:07:46.920 one color that's very interesting what
03:07:49.520 color would that be he's already done
03:07:51.600 right it's Kingdom of white yeah so but
03:07:54.160 white might be done there might be so
03:07:55.399 many other colors there there are many
03:07:56.640 options you can do a particular fabric
03:07:58.399 you can do a particular thing but I'm
03:07:59.840 again looking at longetivity whatever
03:08:01.279 you do right like black I think is an
03:08:03.520 incredi yeah could be right okay you're
03:08:06.479 done uh I would um I would do pets what
03:08:11.560 around pets um I would do accessories
03:08:14.279 for pets as opposed to food I think
03:08:17.080 accessories you mean like leashes pet
03:08:20.160 cleaning pet
03:08:21.920 grooming I think it's a market with high
03:08:24.239 gross margins you can create
03:08:26.000 differentiated products I think it's a
03:08:27.640 tenure sort of growth story the other
03:08:30.000 area I would think about um is actually
03:08:33.920 at leisure uh I still think there's lots
03:08:36.760 and lots and lots of space I think my
03:08:38.560 Bliss Club is trying to do Club is doing
03:08:40.680 it with with its yeah so
03:08:43.720 um yeah so I think there is one but I
03:08:46.600 think there are many that can actually
03:08:48.040 happen and I think it's a trend that I
03:08:49.439 think and I would like to it's an
03:08:51.319 interesting one to incubate can I tell
03:08:52.880 you I'm a Lululemon fanatic okay I'm
03:08:56.120 talking socks t-shirts pants underwear
03:09:00.120 bags caps
03:09:02.279 everything uh it's like Nike Plus 25% if
03:09:05.680 you buy it in the US or in Canada or
03:09:07.720 whatever whatever I have
03:09:10.279 tried like which wants to be like
03:09:13.319 Lululemon nothing has come close not
03:09:15.880 forget CL standpoint or just just from a
03:09:18.840 comfort comfort and fit like Lululemon
03:09:21.680 has no branding right they never have a
03:09:23.080 logo or anything you even pull out their
03:09:24.800 tag so there's no tag even the entire
03:09:28.160 thing is I feel like how you can move in
03:09:30.680 that fabric how you can sweat in that
03:09:33.640 fabric how how light and comfortable
03:09:37.120 that fabric feels like I wish I had
03:09:38.920 stock unfortunately I have zero stock of
03:09:40.640 Lululemon but it's like a $40 billion
03:09:43.160 company now how can anyone ever compete
03:09:46.040 with them if they have that much
03:09:47.319 resources and money to make better
03:09:49.640 fabric better fit better everything but
03:09:52.239 the longitude of any fashion business is
03:09:54.080 not so large because you are as good as
03:09:56.520 your last season in a in a fashion
03:09:58.040 business but is that fashion or is it
03:09:59.399 fashion plus Tech I think fashion plus
03:10:02.080 tech there are two players who have
03:10:03.040 played it maybe Lulu Lemon some somebody
03:10:04.800 n and unigo I think they and both very
03:10:07.200 successful and both have been quite
03:10:09.000 successful but but Tech earlier never
03:10:10.520 used to work in fashion but I think
03:10:12.960 another thing to tell people is sorry I
03:10:14.840 have just one thing just on that just I
03:10:17.000 I by the way think um you don't need to
03:10:20.760 compete with the Lululemon I think there
03:10:23.319 is again in India one there are multiple
03:10:26.200 segments I think the Lulu segment is
03:10:28.880 probably living in the building and like
03:10:30.520 a few other buildings and so on right I
03:10:32.000 mean they're aware Global brand you know
03:10:34.359 I don't think it's particularly
03:10:35.359 expensive but I think it is something
03:10:36.880 that is still premium it's like Nike I
03:10:39.040 think a t-shirt will be 4 5,000 rupees
03:10:41.239 Nike Plus 30% Nike plus 30 is okay fine
03:10:44.560 I mean it's not available widely here
03:10:45.880 either anyway so but I think there is an
03:10:48.359 affordable athleisure that I think even
03:10:50.800 the Bliss clubs what is bliss Club known
03:10:52.800 for I think it's fit right and and
03:10:55.600 therefore fit in a following I think
03:10:57.080 it's possible to crack fit I actually
03:10:59.040 think Indian body types are different by
03:11:01.359 the way so I think if you build an
03:11:02.760 Indian athesia brand you can build it
03:11:04.439 for India you can build the fits right I
03:11:07.319 think the fabric technology I mean Kish
03:11:09.279 knows this better but I think it's
03:11:10.479 widely available I mean you have to go
03:11:11.680 Global but I think it's widely a I feel
03:11:13.439 it's like a science like just making a
03:11:17.120 Lululemon say shirt or t-shirt the way
03:11:22.000 it feels it could be Placebo talking
03:11:25.160 like I might be like talking out of my
03:11:26.920 here but it genuinely sold out yeah
03:11:31.239 correct cortic and I think he is
03:11:33.160 following more because it's a $40
03:11:34.359 million company more than I find very
03:11:36.840 interesting like but the stock price of
03:11:38.439 the fit or both both I feel like
03:11:40.960 Patagonia Lululemon
03:11:43.359 these are Brands which are built around
03:11:45.479 stories and I think these lifestyle
03:11:48.680 created a lifestyle no no and even
03:11:50.160 Patagonia right I mean what a great
03:11:51.479 story where I mean he donated all of his
03:11:54.600 shareholding to I feel like that's
03:11:56.640 becoming such a big part of building a
03:11:58.359 brand and I think anyone that's what we
03:12:00.479 always said now greed fear and altruism
03:12:02.319 alism builds a brand yeah 0 to one I
03:12:04.560 think has to like so bear in mind with
03:12:06.439 what he just said cuz that story has to
03:12:09.439 start from the beginning to the end it
03:12:11.359 can't change along the way interesting
03:12:13.920 we have an interesting brand now which
03:12:15.239 is like idfc Bank where the stories
03:12:17.840 about alism yeah correct correct correct
03:12:20.840 Vio yeah yeah vioo even Tas in a way
03:12:25.399 yeah Raj I would build men's Beauty
03:12:29.880 brand uh and I C new category it's it's
03:12:34.680 growing I think men are equally insecure
03:12:39.560 about how they want to look or maybe
03:12:41.120 just want to in improve the way they
03:12:43.399 want to have their under eye or the or
03:12:46.720 like you know just hide their duck SPS
03:12:49.920 blemish everything and I think there's
03:12:51.520 not enough there are not enough Brands
03:12:53.120 to do it uh that's why is that more
03:12:55.840 except can I ask this question because
03:12:57.600 there is I don't know that many men who
03:13:00.160 wear makeup like I probably don't even
03:13:02.160 know one but there is such a stigma
03:13:05.920 around a man wearing makeup would you
03:13:09.160 package it in a manner where it does not
03:13:11.040 sound like makeup yeah so here's a way
03:13:13.520 to do it right if I come and give you
03:13:16.040 that hey here's buy let's say XYZ
03:13:19.160 concealer and stuff like that and this
03:13:20.960 you put it under your eye you do it
03:13:23.200 probably large majority of men would buy
03:13:24.960 today but if I come up with a different
03:13:27.439 form and just be like this is going to
03:13:29.520 sort your under eye and don't call it
03:13:31.960 like concealer or something what would
03:13:33.760 you call it I don't know like it's not
03:13:35.720 in back of my head like I can't think of
03:13:37.600 it but I'll think of it like problem
03:13:39.840 solution as problem it's just it's like
03:13:42.000 under eyes the problem yours it is
03:13:43.760 functionality functionality
03:13:44.640 functionality so that's what because I
03:13:46.200 think there's not enough brand would you
03:13:47.800 get a celebrity who's the epitome of
03:13:50.680 masculinity to sell something like this
03:13:52.880 so because I do most of the Creator and
03:13:55.479 celebrity lead I would in this because
03:13:58.040 there's such a fresh category I would
03:13:59.880 rather pick up on people who are normal
03:14:02.200 just like me than celebrities and build
03:14:03.920 on their stories for example for example
03:14:06.120 I'll give this to 100 people for free
03:14:09.120 ask their reviews and make their reviews
03:14:11.160 as a story like this is the new thing
03:14:13.359 for men as well and which influencer
03:14:14.880 would you pick I would do very micro
03:14:17.040 influencers I would do 100 small
03:14:18.800 influencers then like become like a big
03:14:21.040 in is that a new trend in branding like
03:14:24.000 would you go to thousands of micro
03:14:25.800 versus macro yeah absolutely because
03:14:28.560 this is in this category I'm not selling
03:14:30.479 aspiration in this category I'm solving
03:14:32.520 a problem so if there was an aspiration
03:14:34.520 or a community play probably I would
03:14:35.960 have picked up on a larger influencer
03:14:38.319 but because I'm only picking up on a
03:14:40.040 problem and solution because the
03:14:41.120 category doesn't exist you have to to
03:14:43.000 invest a lot in category building and
03:14:44.880 category creation yeah then I'll do it I
03:14:47.880 have investment in a company called
03:14:49.880 kluen which is probably the leading Tech
03:14:53.439 of aggregating micro micro influencers
03:14:56.000 is with Quan no no no kluen is with Sham
03:14:58.880 and Hyderabad oh sham yeah yeah of
03:15:00.520 course of course correct correct I'll
03:15:02.080 tell you this ecosystem has changed so
03:15:04.560 much I think the influencer ecosystem
03:15:06.680 right so such a spike with gambling
03:15:09.760 money crypto money all of that suddenly
03:15:12.960 there seems to be like a vacuum which
03:15:14.720 has come about there there is a re uh
03:15:18.840 reworking of the ladder of how much
03:15:21.120 which influencer gets paid which is
03:15:22.760 going to be so drastically different
03:15:24.319 from last year it's chaos in that
03:15:26.120 industry Confluence by far is the best
03:15:28.640 in my opinion but I
03:15:31.560 think that industry needs a fresh funnel
03:15:34.279 like yesterday yeah of people spending
03:15:36.920 marketing money behind it micro
03:15:38.399 influencers yeah yeah definitely in fact
03:15:40.840 there was a survey recently that that
03:15:43.359 you get convinced by your friends the
03:15:44.960 most friends and family second you get
03:15:47.439 convinced by people who you follow but
03:15:49.000 are not that known yeah and third you
03:15:51.160 get convinced by influencers the
03:15:53.120 celebrity in this comes like sixth or
03:15:54.960 seventh
03:15:55.800 number and somehow people have this
03:15:57.840 stupid notion that the efficacy of
03:15:59.760 Indian neutal will be lesser than
03:16:01.720 foreign ones somebody has to break that
03:16:04.080 correct so if somebody creates a brand
03:16:05.880 there it has to be around proven effic
03:16:08.160 efficacy I think efficacy has to be the
03:16:09.920 key and I think there's a very
03:16:11.160 interesting opportunity there as well I
03:16:13.080 think for sure anyway if I had I just
03:16:15.399 remembered something if I had to create
03:16:16.960 a brand today I think it would be around
03:16:19.920 seniors yeah we spoke about it yeah yeah
03:16:22.359 seniors and I think interesting there is
03:16:25.760 somebody working on it already and I
03:16:27.800 feel like the influences I would hire
03:16:29.840 would also be old people who are still
03:16:31.439 relevant y that is one of the new
03:16:33.520 consumer groups we have identified in
03:16:34.880 the new top 30 very interesting by the
03:16:37.960 way I think it's an opportunity I it's a
03:16:40.640 opportunity that not many people are to
03:16:42.880 give all their and not competitive no
03:16:44.960 they are not wanting to give all their
03:16:46.040 wealth to the children they want to
03:16:47.680 enjoy
03:16:48.680 life right so they have ability to pay
03:16:51.120 it's not particularly competitive
03:16:52.439 interesting one point of failure when
03:16:54.760 you were starting a Brand 0 to one that
03:16:57.000 happened that you think other people can
03:16:59.359 learn from what not to
03:17:01.600 do one common reason why brand starting
03:17:04.479 or fail I think we did uh I think in my
03:17:07.960 journey we counted we did close to 120
03:17:10.120 brands or labels or whatever you call it
03:17:12.479 yeah and uh I would say we must have got
03:17:16.000 20 wrong and whenever we analyze what
03:17:18.680 went wrong was uh the name the type
03:17:23.520 style the logo what do you call it the
03:17:27.760 what do you call the brand codes the
03:17:29.600 category codes being
03:17:31.880 wrong and product and the pricing so
03:17:34.720 these were all the reasons for if you
03:17:37.160 had to pick the top reason I think it's
03:17:40.319 sometimes the just the name wow wow the
03:17:43.319 name is incredibly Valu and the logo
03:17:46.399 name and logo yeah wow anath thinking
03:17:52.279 um I think uh for me I think when we
03:17:56.560 have
03:17:58.279 compromised quality for Speed of launch
03:18:02.399 it's been bad right so for example you
03:18:05.920 have a deadline to launch right you need
03:18:08.399 to sort of but I believe that's all
03:18:10.080 hygiene product has to be right only no
03:18:12.000 no but I'm saying by the way you know
03:18:13.640 it's my failure we're talking about not
03:18:15.120 yours fair enough so I think uh you know
03:18:18.239 my sense is for me I think it is a
03:18:19.960 little bit more of you know product
03:18:22.000 quality I think we are soon reaching
03:18:25.120 4:00 yeah it's getting well beyond my
03:18:27.600 bedtime so I think uh it's basically for
03:18:30.760 me when we've compromised on quality um
03:18:33.239 not quality but whatever right all the
03:18:35.520 small details some shortcuts yeah
03:18:37.040 shortcuts right you know you've not got
03:18:38.479 the fit completely right you have not
03:18:40.040 got the packaging completely right and
03:18:41.920 you sort of push for Speed right I think
03:18:45.080 that's actually been and it the
03:18:47.239 consequences last for a very long time
03:18:49.239 right you don't realize it but I think
03:18:50.920 therefore taking the time to do it is is
03:18:53.080 important one mistake I think I'll go
03:18:56.160 with more of when you start as a solo
03:18:58.520 founder and you have just two three
03:19:00.000 people eventually I think very very
03:19:03.080 basic thing I'm going to tell like I
03:19:04.920 think we should prepare a checklist and
03:19:07.880 go through that checklist every month of
03:19:09.680 hygienic details giving you exam
03:19:12.640 I made a major mistake when first time I
03:19:14.359 started selling on Amazon just the tax I
03:19:18.479 chose luxury good instead of essential
03:19:21.080 yeah we spoke about this just I mine I
03:19:24.640 was selling essential Goods I was
03:19:25.840 selling disinfectant sprays Y and I
03:19:27.800 chose luxury goods and that costed me
03:19:30.920 22% right GST GST and there was 22% I
03:19:36.279 mean it
03:19:37.479 changes no like I can change it after
03:19:40.080 once I figured out but the the cycle is
03:19:42.640 so long I figured out after 3 months I
03:19:45.239 ended up losing a lot of money and made
03:19:47.920 nothing in fact like so my profit was on
03:19:50.399 that was 12 to 133% I lost
03:19:54.960 10% so that was a problem so I think you
03:19:58.000 should make a checklist like a hygiene
03:19:59.840 of 20 30 things and go through that
03:20:01.840 every month so that if even if you're
03:20:03.760 making some mistake you can correct it
03:20:05.439 next month specifically when you're
03:20:07.319 starting very individual solo lean team
03:20:10.160 yeah because there are no checklist we
03:20:11.439 don't know struct sure right is like we
03:20:12.640 just want to do everything right yeah
03:20:14.800 okay so the last part we normally do a
03:20:17.560 charity with every episode we thought
03:20:20.960 we'll do it differently as a experiment
03:20:24.000 this time so in all that we spoke about
03:20:28.560 we will pick an entrepreneur in either
03:20:32.840 fashion or Cosmetics or any of the
03:20:35.279 industries we discussed who would
03:20:37.520 otherwise not have got funding and we
03:20:40.399 will fund by virtue of this podcast okay
03:20:43.760 uh under the age of 22 under the age of
03:20:46.920 222 some young entrepreneur for this
03:20:50.199 particular episode so I mean I want to
03:20:53.199 open it up to you guys and we'll figure
03:20:55.680 out the filtering mechanism we'll put
03:20:57.279 out an application we will review and
03:20:59.199 finalize together which company that
03:21:00.920 should be sure uh but I'm saying
03:21:03.439 specifically 22 because these guys find
03:21:05.560 it much harder to raise funding okay
03:21:07.800 typically in college side project
03:21:10.439 they're not uh at zero but they're in
03:21:13.239 the Journey of zero to one essentially
03:21:15.279 sure finding young people when he
03:21:17.600 started like yeah yeah like him like you
03:21:21.000 you know in the last we find somebody
03:21:23.040 like that in the last episode we had the
03:21:25.560 zepto guys and you know the one thing
03:21:27.560 they said that was so incredibly cool is
03:21:30.479 they got a grant of 40 lakhs from this
03:21:32.840 fund when they were 18 and that's what
03:21:34.840 helped them build zpp to amazing yeah so
03:21:37.960 we'll figure out an investment between
03:21:39.560 all of this we'll finalize is there
03:21:42.239 amount of money you'd like to commit
03:21:43.760 towards that investment you can decide
03:21:45.080 on everybody's behalf now I can also
03:21:46.920 whatever yeah just pick a number so we
03:21:48.720 can just close
03:21:51.920 it um I don't know 10 lakhs 20 lakhs
03:21:55.000 yeah whatever same whatever yeah I'll do
03:21:57.840 the same same I'll do the 10 should we
03:21:59.359 do 10 10 10 10 40 will be enough yeah
03:22:03.239 zepto started with 40 LS it's
03:22:05.319 not yeah Z start
03:22:08.199 40 okay fine all right but I'm I think
03:22:12.479 it's a great idea I never thought about
03:22:13.760 it I think under 22 would be quite an
03:22:15.840 interesting finding would be so hard
03:22:17.880 finding is also going to be hard right
03:22:19.279 so we'll put out an application okay
03:22:21.399 we'll have some preset filters okay
03:22:23.479 we'll bring it down to say 10 15
03:22:25.439 companies which are finalized then we'll
03:22:27.439 do a zoom call between the four of us
03:22:29.080 and pick one of them very interesting
03:22:31.439 terrific and I think it's a great idea
03:22:33.199 to help those people who would not have
03:22:34.800 gotten funding otherwise in fact uh it's
03:22:37.520 it's interesting an alternate to a
03:22:39.199 charity yeah yeah so in fact Maybe much
03:22:42.040 better also should we do a larger amount
03:22:44.000 so it'll be game changing we can do we
03:22:45.640 can do two whatever or we can do two
03:22:47.680 companies so should we do 20 lakhs each
03:22:49.760 and two companies 40 lakhs yeah that's
03:22:52.000 much better yeah I think it'll increase
03:22:54.080 the probability also done and we will
03:22:56.840 ask them to
03:22:58.359 incorporate we can also ask them to
03:23:00.279 incorporate all they learned on this
03:23:01.960 episode there going to be a long many
03:23:04.040 hours session of insights they can learn
03:23:07.439 from yeah but that's it thank you all
