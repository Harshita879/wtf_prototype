00:00:00.240 so we just start rolling okay yeah so
00:00:02.600 how we typically start this is each one
00:00:06.040 of us says something controversial about
00:00:09.040 us that nobody knows right
00:00:11.470 [Music]
00:00:28.519 now ready good
00:00:30.310 [Music]
00:00:34.160 right so how we typically start this is
00:00:38.320 each one of us say something
00:00:40.559 controversial about us that nobody knows
00:00:43.640 right
00:00:46.000 now I'm a l company
00:00:48.920 boss I'm part of
00:00:53.440 youry maybe you can talk about something
00:00:56.160 not related to the company more like
00:00:57.760 personal I don't know yeah okay shall I
00:01:01.399 go yeah well I'm very uh temperamental
00:01:05.040 which people think I'm not you are
00:01:07.479 temperamental can be very explosive 1%
00:01:10.880 of the time wow I haven't really seen a.
00:01:13.240 1% of the time my image is in the
00:01:15.960 industry to be the most uh calest person
00:01:18.920 around yeah true and who are you usually
00:01:21.920 temperamental with just very mood
00:01:24.920 sometimes very moody oh so if I were to
00:01:28.000 meet your childhood classmate your best
00:01:30.479 friend yeah and ask
00:01:33.880 him if nitish is capable of one
00:01:36.880 extremely naughty thing in life yeah at
00:01:39.560 the age of 40 50 whatever what would he
00:01:42.640 prophesize you be capable of doing he
00:01:44.840 wouldn't believe it nothing come on I
00:01:48.439 was the most simplest most quietest uh
00:01:51.360 kid in school yeah yeah absolutely very
00:01:56.280 introvert I've changed now
00:02:00.479 do you consider yourself an introvert
00:02:02.240 today yes but much better than what I
00:02:04.600 was when I was much younger and I think
00:02:07.119 YPO changed me lot in the last decade or
00:02:10.360 so do you want to tell everybody who
00:02:12.800 does not know what is YPO give us a sure
00:02:16.000 minute on vipo vipo is uh the young
00:02:18.440 president's organization it's a
00:02:20.640 originally a US
00:02:22.519 organization but uh has 14 CH more than
00:02:26.239 14 I think 15 or 16 chapters now in
00:02:28.640 India uh it come brings together uh
00:02:32.720 businessmen uh Professionals in a very
00:02:35.720 close group so in mumbay for example I
00:02:38.760 think a total of 300 members might be
00:02:40.959 there and we organize a lot of learning
00:02:43.239 events like I was just telling right we
00:02:45.400 we visiting Soul next week and we're
00:02:48.040 doing a lot of learning activity we're
00:02:49.400 actually visiting Sean's large Crafton
00:02:52.280 office where we meeting the CEO Etc I
00:02:55.280 think it's a great networking event and
00:02:57.599 you make get to know a lot of great
00:02:59.239 people you in YPO so you can add to that
00:03:01.560 what I didn't but
00:03:04.400 yeah I think of vipo very differently
00:03:07.319 yeah I have very first principles
00:03:10.920 questioning
00:03:12.440 about why people give so much money to
00:03:15.239 an
00:03:16.319 organization and then work for the
00:03:18.440 organization for
00:03:20.159 free uh when I was not in YPO I say bad
00:03:24.360 things about everybody okay this is a
00:03:26.000 very open Forum so feel free to join me
00:03:28.599 and I'm going to pull all your legs so
00:03:30.000 feel free to pull it back otherwise I'll
00:03:32.000 feel bad and guilty at the end of
00:03:35.000 it YPO before I joined appeared like
00:03:37.959 this organization where rich people hang
00:03:39.840 out yeah and I had a lot of curiosity
00:03:43.879 about what rich people might be doing
00:03:46.920 together when they hang out in a closed
00:03:48.680 room and they're not allowing cameras
00:03:52.000 and Outsiders to come
00:03:54.280 in but in the few years that I have been
00:03:58.599 with them I have kind of realized that
00:04:02.079 uh it's like a social network right it's
00:04:05.200 a social network for people to hang
00:04:08.480 out uh eat drink chill correct
00:04:15.199 uh go on holidays correct and also learn
00:04:18.880 on the side that's right so I don't know
00:04:20.839 how to put wipo in a box but it feels
00:04:23.520 like if you move to a new city and
00:04:25.759 you've been lucky in Life or you were
00:04:27.320 born Lucky in life it's a good good way
00:04:30.199 to make friends very quickly that's true
00:04:32.880 and there's also Brotherhood right you
00:04:34.360 go anywhere in the world and you meet a
00:04:36.400 fellow viure there's a instant connect
00:04:38.960 why is that I think there's a Code of
00:04:40.960 Conduct right Vio forget all of that
00:04:43.680 deep down why is that trust I think why
00:04:46.639 trust I think one because you are a YPO
00:04:50.000 member because you know he is from
00:04:53.120 affluence and he has paid a certain
00:04:55.199 amount of fee to be in
00:04:57.440 Organization no on sounds fair
00:05:00.759 sounds fair no no perhaps to a bit but
00:05:03.680 more importantly I think uh it's also
00:05:06.320 because as a vipo over the years I've
00:05:08.479 been a vipo over 10 years right uh I
00:05:11.639 think you learned certain code of
00:05:12.960 conducts which you tend to stick to for
00:05:14.800 example confidentiality do you want to
00:05:17.000 introduce yourself professionally as
00:05:18.680 well yeah sure yeah so I'm the founder
00:05:21.520 and CEO of nazara Technologies nazara is
00:05:24.680 uh India's only listed gaming company I
00:05:27.680 actually started coding games at the age
00:05:29.759 of seven so one of the lucky guys who
00:05:33.560 discovered his passion at a very young
00:05:36.199 age and I've had the fortune of at a
00:05:39.039 young age my parents encouraged me a lot
00:05:41.680 I was doing gaming uh now what 37 35
00:05:45.000 years back and I pursu that for my
00:05:47.120 entire life now we became the first uh
00:05:49.840 listed gaming company in 2021 so 3 years
00:05:54.000 now and uh the journey continues the
00:05:56.680 game continues and I continue to play it
00:05:59.039 do you regret it
00:06:00.160 listing not at all no not at all I
00:06:02.919 wouldn't have met you and got you as an
00:06:06.120 investor okay for all the disclosures
00:06:09.759 that should be made I am an investor in
00:06:11.440 Nati's company okay and uh what is it 4
00:06:14.680 five% 5% 5% investor in n's company and
00:06:19.240 we meet often and uh like I'm going to
00:06:23.720 bug all of you today I bug him a lot on
00:06:25.680 questions and because I want to
00:06:27.960 understand this domain a bit more today
00:06:29.880 is rooted from that same curiosity
00:06:32.840 because so many people are telling me
00:06:36.160 that gaming is this next big thing the
00:06:38.199 young today are spending so much more
00:06:40.599 time on gaming than traditional forms of
00:06:43.560 entertainment so I have a lot of
00:06:44.800 curiosity around it but most people who
00:06:48.560 have who I have asked in person not on
00:06:50.919 camera if they regret listing and
00:06:53.400 becoming a public company say they do I
00:06:56.080 don't nine out of 10 I absolutely don't
00:06:59.160 but why do you inherently think listing
00:07:02.080 a company is good is access to Capital
00:07:04.199 cheaper see from our case I think I
00:07:07.879 really
00:07:08.919 thought two things I having run this
00:07:11.599 business for a really long time two
00:07:13.759 decades at a time when gaming didn't
00:07:16.120 exist in India I really felt at that
00:07:18.720 point of time that one by going public
00:07:21.800 as India's first gaming company we could
00:07:24.879 really plant a flag that India is
00:07:26.960 opening up is it good PR very good PR I
00:07:30.120 mean if things are going well uh and for
00:07:32.599 us are any of your shareholders also
00:07:35.000 your clients is there a significant
00:07:37.080 overlap no uh in terms of uh end players
00:07:42.000 they would be but we don't Market or
00:07:43.759 cross Market to them I mean we don't
00:07:46.159 cross Market our Equity to our players
00:07:49.520 it's difficult to extrapolate that or
00:07:52.319 figure out the exact data but what is it
00:07:54.599 when you list a company yeah is it
00:07:56.919 because you're able to get money cheaply
00:07:59.720 and faster and easily yeah is it that
00:08:02.440 you're doing a marketing exercise yeah
00:08:04.879 I'm assuming when you go from preu to
00:08:09.560 public you spend as much
00:08:11.440 as best case 1 and a half 2% worst case
00:08:15.599 4 5% in the bankers you bring in the
00:08:20.759 Consultants you bring in the accounting
00:08:22.840 fees all of that put together so if
00:08:25.120 somebody is spending that much money
00:08:27.400 what is the true incentive if you're
00:08:29.240 saying PR your shareholders are not
00:08:31.240 really your clients if it's not Capital
00:08:34.000 then what is it no I think in the last 3
00:08:37.200 4 five years as nazara went public our
00:08:41.200 brand visibility and companies
00:08:43.440 credibility significantly increased
00:08:46.240 credibility to who to your customers to
00:08:48.440 a variety of stakeholders I would say
00:08:50.760 when I say customers are customers are
00:08:52.440 end Gamers I think maybe not so much to
00:08:55.279 them but even Partners like Sean and
00:08:58.440 Crafton and global players like that
00:09:00.680 when they're coming into India and
00:09:01.839 wanting to partner I think today nazara
00:09:04.160 is clearly one company that they're very
00:09:06.480 happy to talk to and partner and maybe
00:09:08.480 Sean you can agree or not agree with me
00:09:11.240 yeah I mean I totally agree um I mean
00:09:14.000 being listed give lot of um good
00:09:17.240 publicity good publicity and then like
00:09:20.519 feeling of know trustworthy to
00:09:23.320 especially the companies outside India
00:09:25.720 which who might not have which might not
00:09:27.800 have a very good visibility and uh
00:09:31.320 understanding about the backgrounds of
00:09:32.720 the company actually I I felt the same
00:09:35.880 when Crafton got listed uh maybe around
00:09:39.320 similar timing yeah uh in how big is
00:09:42.399 Crafton I know nazara is 5,000 clothes
00:09:45.399 yeah we we our market cap is around 9
00:09:49.920 billion 10 billion US dollar now yeah so
00:09:52.560 that's that's what one reason I think uh
00:09:54.600 there are many other related uh reasons
00:09:57.680 as well I also Al felt one of the
00:10:01.279 reasons for a lot of uh private
00:10:03.880 companies like I was a VC backed company
00:10:06.560 for many many years and there are a lot
00:10:09.120 of
00:10:10.160 commitments uh sha terms preferences
00:10:13.760 that you give to the investors in my
00:10:15.519 case I was very lucky I had West Bridge
00:10:17.800 Capital which you would know in
00:10:19.320 Bangalore sandep singal who invested in
00:10:22.000 me from 2015 all the way till 2018 2019
00:10:25.160 you also had rakala for yeah of course
00:10:28.440 raki invest 2018 uh much later right but
00:10:32.519 uh are you saying VCS are the bigger
00:10:34.680 demon in the room than public market
00:10:36.399 retail clients no I'm saying as an
00:10:39.120 entrepreneur you know that there are a
00:10:41.480 lot of terms you have signed
00:10:44.160 on uh which you don't necessarily like
00:10:47.160 in like again I want to clarify with me
00:10:50.000 uh my relation with Westbridge or sandep
00:10:51.680 single was fantastic they were always
00:10:53.320 very patient and never in 15 years we
00:10:55.320 never picked up the agreement and looked
00:10:56.639 at it but psychologically once you go
00:10:59.320 public all these rights fall away right
00:11:02.480 because everybody has equal rights and
00:11:04.440 I'm as answerable to one sharehold one
00:11:06.959 single shareholder having one single
00:11:08.440 share as I am to you right it's it's
00:11:11.839 kind of an empowering feeling uh is what
00:11:14.560 I feel and um yeah I think um honestly
00:11:19.560 I'm enjoying it it is has its own
00:11:21.240 challenges for example quarterly
00:11:23.120 pressures every quarter results I think
00:11:25.680 the compliances take care of themselves
00:11:27.760 after a point right the hygiene happens
00:11:30.519 that's not so much of an issue but it's
00:11:32.880 also how you approach it like I have
00:11:35.000 tried in the last three years as a
00:11:36.480 listed company and that's what I've been
00:11:37.760 sharing with a lot of entrepreneurs who
00:11:40.079 list it's not easy to walk the talk but
00:11:44.320 you have to do the right thing what you
00:11:46.600 genuinely believe is right versus trying
00:11:48.920 to deliver the next quarter's result
00:11:51.160 even at sometimes if that is a
00:11:52.600 short-term pain second is you have to
00:11:54.639 try be as transparent and disclose as
00:11:56.760 much as you want so if a shareholder
00:11:58.440 wants to call you and and ask what you
00:12:00.560 had for breakfast this
00:12:01.959 morning you should be ready to say I'll
00:12:04.680 say this about nitish if I were to
00:12:07.959 categorize him with a word cloud as a
00:12:10.800 human
00:12:11.600 being I would say conservative I'm not
00:12:14.040 going to praise him because he's sitting
00:12:15.279 in front of me
00:12:17.160 sure I would say
00:12:20.760 conservative last person I would assume
00:12:23.440 will ever do anything
00:12:25.920 Reckless
00:12:27.600 uh I would also say
00:12:30.440 very diligent detail
00:12:34.160 oriented and believes in long-term
00:12:38.399 relationships uh we live in a world
00:12:40.639 where things go up and down so quite so
00:12:43.440 quickly so the big big thing about
00:12:46.320 nitish is you know 10 20 30 years from
00:12:49.839 now he'll still be here he might not be
00:12:52.680 growing the fastest but he will be doing
00:12:55.920 the right thing slowly in the background
00:12:57.959 which uh
00:13:00.440 strangely enough is a really rare
00:13:03.240 thing not just here but everywhere in
00:13:05.600 the world today you learn from your
00:13:08.040 lessons right I when I started I was
00:13:10.040 like 178 right in the start of the do
00:13:14.440 boom in 99 and the crash in 2000 right
00:13:18.680 so I learned my lessons very quickly
00:13:20.360 then and uh I think the conservatism
00:13:23.160 comes a bit from there uh which is a
00:13:26.000 good thing and a bad thing right because
00:13:27.720 it has its own handicap also so but it
00:13:30.040 allows you to live to fight another day
00:13:33.360 sustain which is a good thing even my
00:13:35.639 industry is like that stock markets yeah
00:13:38.320 it's all about living to fight another
00:13:39.880 day Sean would you like to go next yeah
00:13:42.680 why
00:13:43.360 not yeah I'm I'm from from South Korea
00:13:47.600 yeah um I was born in poang which is uh
00:13:52.240 like South uh eastern coast city I was
00:13:56.160 born from there uh from you know from uh
00:14:00.199 parents who are working for with one of
00:14:03.360 the largest state company uh in the
00:14:05.560 world um so I'm from the middle class uh
00:14:08.759 family yeah that's my I'm guessing South
00:14:11.440 Korean middle class is much more Rich
00:14:13.360 than Indian middle class what is uh GDP
00:14:16.279 per capita in South Korea $50,000
00:14:19.399 33,000 now I guess 33 middle class would
00:14:22.120 be like $70,000 $80,000 a year yeah
00:14:25.040 household income might be like that but
00:14:27.279 then you have to understand that Korea
00:14:30.360 grows grew quite fast so when I was like
00:14:34.600 you know 10 15 it was I would I cannot
00:14:39.199 say that it was similar to what uh India
00:14:41.680 economy is now uh currently uh uh you
00:14:44.959 know position but South Korea GDP uh
00:14:48.519 when there was a Olympic in 1988 it was
00:14:52.199 2,500
00:14:53.720 26700 which is pretty similar to where
00:14:56.519 India is so uh um as a as a South Korean
00:15:00.560 we uh started from like in 6070s before
00:15:04.360 I was born it was uh it was developing
00:15:07.399 country in the Lower Side uh among among
00:15:10.079 Global uh peers and then he grew into
00:15:13.199 like developed country in the like what
00:15:15.000 era are you talking about which year
00:15:16.600 from from 70s till maybe 2000 these 30
00:15:21.079 30 years Korea Maybe started from maybe
00:15:23.759 300 400 uh GDP per capita and become now
00:15:28.680 like you know 15,000 maybe 15,000 around
00:15:32.600 uh like early 2000 yeah so that was the
00:15:35.079 journey like Korean economy grew quite
00:15:37.480 fast do you have any North Korean
00:15:38.959 friends or did you ever not really like
00:15:42.160 it has been separated like more than 70
00:15:45.000 years now um and we are not allowed to
00:15:48.199 visit North Korea legally yeah or if you
00:15:51.800 enter you cannot South Korea sorry are
00:15:54.160 there any North Koreans in South Korea
00:15:56.040 yeah yeah I mean there are quite sizable
00:15:58.480 uh
00:15:59.639 defectors like they
00:16:02.000 are uh they are ex they are defecting
00:16:05.720 from North Korea through uh through uh
00:16:10.800 third party countries like China Vietnam
00:16:13.319 Mongolia Thailand so I believe I don't
00:16:16.639 really remember the exact number but uh
00:16:19.319 I think at the peak there was 10,000 or
00:16:21.399 20,000 per year the North Koreans
00:16:23.880 defecting North Korea to to enter CH
00:16:26.000 enter South Korea what's Korean Society
00:16:28.519 like today I have never been I would
00:16:30.360 love to go yeah you should you should so
00:16:32.839 you've been in India a while now you
00:16:34.199 live in Bangalore where I also live yeah
00:16:37.079 if you had to draw parallels between
00:16:40.440 Society in Bangalore and Society in
00:16:43.360 north in South Korea
00:16:45.519 sorry that mistake has happened quite
00:16:48.720 what what is similar and what is
00:16:51.279 dissimilar um uh like Korea South Korea
00:16:54.759 is very uh quite um uh hom Virginia
00:16:59.319 Society it's getting more Cosmopolitan
00:17:02.040 it's uh there are uh more immigrants
00:17:05.640 especially from Southeast Asia um but I
00:17:09.079 think overall
00:17:11.240 9 7 8% are all Korean in terms of
00:17:15.240 population so it's a very and also it's
00:17:18.119 a it's a small country uh I think uh the
00:17:20.799 land mass is around
00:17:23.280 100,000 square kilometers which might be
00:17:26.520 I don't know 20 times or 40 times
00:17:28.319 smaller than in India uh so all people
00:17:31.919 speak only Korean uh there's no Hindi
00:17:34.840 speaking people English speaking English
00:17:37.320 uh I mean because of Education uh it has
00:17:40.360 taken some time but I think Young
00:17:42.000 Koreans speak fairly good English but
00:17:44.080 it's still very much like the second
00:17:45.679 language is it yeah of course of course
00:17:47.559 so in school we I mean most of Public
00:17:51.120 School uh do not use English as a medium
00:17:55.360 for teaching classes so English has a
00:17:57.960 separate sort of uh you know classes
00:18:00.559 which uh maybe 3 hours a week or
00:18:03.760 something like that so English but we
00:18:05.840 spend a lot of money to learn English
00:18:08.600 outside the class outside classroom so
00:18:12.320 um I mean I also studied a lot English
00:18:15.159 outside the school uh which yeah which
00:18:18.640 is the still the case yeah do you live
00:18:20.280 in Bangalore by
00:18:21.559 yourselves yeah I mean half voluntarily
00:18:25.159 and heal involuntarily um um it it's
00:18:29.320 it's kind of long story but uh make it
00:18:31.640 short
00:18:33.000 um when I was working in uh HQ uh in
00:18:37.360 Soul um we start to uh get a sense you
00:18:42.159 know how India is developing as a as a
00:18:45.679 gaming gaming country um I think it it
00:18:49.200 was in 2019 I visited nazara office uh
00:18:53.159 also I visit some other you know
00:18:54.760 companies and VC firms office back then
00:18:58.080 uh and we slowly think about we need to
00:19:02.640 uh properly spend time in India and and
00:19:06.159 invest in Indian companies and and work
00:19:08.320 within Indian companies but that was
00:19:10.080 starting from 2019 uh but the chairman
00:19:12.840 chairman of Crafton he traveled to
00:19:16.799 India way earlier than me maybe 2017 or
00:19:19.880 18 uh and after he came back from there
00:19:22.520 from India uh he he told us like the key
00:19:26.200 you know Executives in the company that
00:19:28.039 we we should do something in India um he
00:19:31.400 didn't tell us how he want us to uh you
00:19:34.320 know to find a way so so I and then we
00:19:37.799 started investment uh and the first
00:19:40.039 investment was was a nodwin nowin gaming
00:19:42.320 which is subsidiary of uh AIT yeah yeah
00:19:45.400 AKA yeah what do you think of akit yeah
00:19:48.600 I mean like no one why anim laughing
00:19:51.640 what do you think of akit maybe he
00:19:53.640 doesn't like he calls himself the
00:19:54.840 professor and I think actually the
00:19:56.120 professor he is the professor of the
00:19:57.799 industry so I've been following akhat
00:20:00.039 for like good 10 years even before I got
00:20:02.080 got into gaming professionally you know
00:20:03.840 when nwin used to when akhat himself was
00:20:05.440 a Caster he used to cast in their own
00:20:08.039 didn't was Gotham both both of them they
00:20:10.039 used to cast their own events I believe
00:20:12.159 that he has changed the face of Esports
00:20:14.600 in India specifically to be debt uh
00:20:18.000 consistent with the efforts when gaming
00:20:19.960 was nothing in India way back in 2014 is
00:20:22.480 I I think when uh he established nwin
00:20:25.520 and then to take some massive steps like
00:20:27.320 you know selling his majority to nazara
00:20:29.320 way back in the days and then still
00:20:31.480 having that same gist to build the
00:20:32.919 company and what nin has been doing over
00:20:34.960 the last one and a half years
00:20:36.520 specifically I think he's a person to
00:20:38.520 look up to and you know like I was
00:20:40.360 smiling because he's the only person at
00:20:42.559 some point in my career I would want to
00:20:44.200 you know stand shoulder Tosh shoulder in
00:20:45.880 the sense of the Enterprise that I build
00:20:48.760 he is one of a kind of what are Esports
00:20:50.640 animes if I may ask uh Esports is gaming
00:20:53.840 in a competitive format wherein there
00:20:56.039 are wins and losses it's not about play
00:20:58.600 playing inside the game and winning and
00:21:00.440 losing but there are teams just like how
00:21:02.520 we have in cricket and you there are
00:21:04.320 fixed set of players there's a roster
00:21:06.039 there's are teams and they are playing
00:21:07.320 with high stakes with a big price full
00:21:08.919 tournament and what kind of games
00:21:10.200 typically uh it could be anything it
00:21:12.000 could be FPS which is like a CS that you
00:21:13.760 were that you used to play back in your
00:21:15.200 days just say full forms FPS is what FPS
00:21:17.480 is first person shooter wherein you know
00:21:19.559 the view of the view format of the game
00:21:21.279 is you have a gun in your hand and you
00:21:22.799 know you can see a first person view is
00:21:24.400 that the most popular kind of game in
00:21:25.960 India shooting India yeah shooting is
00:21:28.039 very popular about third third person
00:21:29.840 shooting TPS like you know the the game
00:21:32.200 like the you can see the character fully
00:21:34.480 and you're moving so Crafton we know now
00:21:36.880 Crafton was a 20 billion company now
00:21:39.400 it's a $10 billion company round
00:21:41.679 about uh how did you get into this
00:21:45.000 industry how are you Crafton CEO now how
00:21:48.520 did you come to India C India CEO um I
00:21:51.000 really like the play game I like uh
00:21:53.080 playing games maybe since I was uh not
00:21:56.720 seven maybe eight nine 10 uh so I maybe
00:22:00.000 after grade grade two or grade three uh
00:22:01.799 my father how old are you now Sean uh 45
00:22:04.919 M 45 also yeah yeah I think we are in
00:22:08.480 the same age 45 yeah born in 78 right 79
00:22:12.000 79 79 my father uh could afford uh you
00:22:17.039 know buying back then it was Apple uh
00:22:19.760 Apple compatible like 8bit computer so
00:22:22.720 my father uh could afford it and
00:22:25.720 honestly back then you say I I want to
00:22:28.080 run how to programming and and things
00:22:29.840 like that but I didn't uh Cote too much
00:22:32.440 I just played game all the time so that
00:22:35.039 was beginning of my uh passion on gaming
00:22:38.720 as a as a hobby mostly and then uh it
00:22:41.799 grew quite a bit so I played a lot even
00:22:44.039 in high school and college um and back
00:22:47.520 then um like Taiwan like Israel Korean
00:22:51.720 South Korean man should go to Army but I
00:22:54.720 back then conscription yeah it's a
00:22:56.840 compulsory but uh we could choose to
00:22:59.159 work for High-Tech company it companies
00:23:02.520 uh including gaming companies uh if you
00:23:05.039 have certain engineering certificate uh
00:23:09.840 uh after like college degree so I I I
00:23:12.960 try uh uh that direction uh so I could
00:23:16.440 get in get a job in game developer which
00:23:19.440 is still which is still exist um uh I
00:23:22.640 could get a job there as a game designer
00:23:25.799 uh so that was my beginning of career in
00:23:29.240 gaming but I found that I'm not that
00:23:31.320 good at game designing or coding so I
00:23:33.520 switched my role to marketing and sales
00:23:37.039 side um and then you know um and I I you
00:23:41.320 know that was the you know how I got
00:23:43.159 into the gaming side um but I actually
00:23:46.720 didn't like working for gaming company I
00:23:48.679 found that it's something different like
00:23:50.360 you like playing games but you don't
00:23:51.960 really like to work for gaming company
00:23:53.520 it was a little to be little casual like
00:23:57.200 it was shy shitty to work for gaming
00:23:59.360 company from young young ambitious men
00:24:02.720 perspectives I want to work for big
00:24:04.400 companies so I switched banking uh how
00:24:07.960 old were you then around 10 years uh
00:24:11.279 after I had an NBA so so I got a u so I
00:24:15.840 I started my career in gaming in 2000 I
00:24:18.480 got an NBA in
00:24:20.320 2008 uh and I started my career in
00:24:22.760 banking from 2008 till 2017 which I join
00:24:26.120 Crafton uh as a as a CFO of of one of
00:24:29.640 the subsidiary um so that's how I got
00:24:31.960 into Crafton and then uh you know we
00:24:36.360 were very successful in in a game uh
00:24:38.960 called pubg um uh and um did pubg get
00:24:43.080 banned in India you you want to talk
00:24:44.720 about pubg yeah I mean like it was more
00:24:46.880 of a it was huge in India right
00:24:48.640 everybody was playing it yeah it's still
00:24:50.080 big but now it's bgmi uh the new is the
00:24:52.600 same thing with a different name uh no
00:24:55.080 it's a India oriented game that made
00:24:56.960 specifically for India and it's a
00:24:58.559 different publisher alog together it has
00:25:00.039 nothing to do with pubg mobile that was
00:25:01.520 a tenson game it was a Chinese company
00:25:03.919 the biggest gaming company you can call
00:25:05.440 it tenson owns everything like majority
00:25:07.919 of the stuff what is the relationship
00:25:09.480 between tensent and
00:25:12.159 Crafton um tensent is the investor uh
00:25:16.640 tensens is investor in Crafton uh before
00:25:19.159 the IPO uh and they still they still
00:25:21.880 maintain some share so your bgmi is also
00:25:25.399 you yeah so you stop St pubg to build
00:25:29.360 bgmi and now that is popular like
00:25:32.799 that uh pubg is actually the original
00:25:35.520 pubg PC is a craftting game and then
00:25:37.960 tensent had the right to build the
00:25:39.840 mobile version of it and that was that's
00:25:42.159 globally available pubg mobile when
00:25:43.600 India band pubg mobile crafting came
00:25:45.120 with Indian version of their thing they
00:25:46.760 made their own thing bgmi right which is
00:25:48.720 Battlegrounds mobile India and what are
00:25:51.039 the differences between these games one
00:25:53.039 is more appealing than the other uh
00:25:54.919 technically nothing but then it's more
00:25:56.679 about the origin and everything that
00:25:58.760 they are to address to you know launch
00:26:00.720 the game in India but China does that to
00:26:03.559 everybody right they don't even allow
00:26:05.159 Facebook and Google in China yeah and
00:26:08.080 for gaming apps or like even before the
00:26:12.039 mobile era they uh allow publishing of
00:26:16.080 games on the approval basis uh which is
00:26:20.000 uh maybe China and Vietnam only in the
00:26:22.399 world do you feel like the world is
00:26:25.919 becoming a more fragmented Place take
00:26:28.559 inspiration from China uh a country
00:26:31.919 which does not allow foreign apps and
00:26:35.399 replicates it with their own
00:26:38.080 versions will all IP that touches the
00:26:42.120 citizens of a certain country in the
00:26:44.760 future be built in the country or at
00:26:46.799 least be owned or hosted in that country
00:26:50.039 it's a really interesting question
00:26:51.399 because I I think that that was the
00:26:52.960 direction we were going and we may go
00:26:55.720 back to that again it it was being
00:26:58.320 called splinternet basically like the
00:27:01.000 idea that because China has its own
00:27:03.320 internal policies where you know you
00:27:05.520 need a license you also need a local
00:27:07.200 partner they were Banning a lot of apps
00:27:09.080 from the US there was the the current
00:27:11.440 situation now and there was a time when
00:27:14.399 when Trump was president of the US and
00:27:16.640 he was going to ban Tik Tok it seemed
00:27:18.240 like we were going to be moving more in
00:27:19.960 that direction we might again but I do
00:27:22.799 think that that's a danger and actually
00:27:26.240 though when it came to me starting a
00:27:28.960 company here in India um that was a
00:27:31.640 consideration because we felt that if
00:27:34.240 the world does move towards a
00:27:36.279 splinternet and if China and Russia are
00:27:38.440 on one side I want to be on the other
00:27:40.080 side and if if India is uh split from
00:27:45.120 China uh currently one one thing that's
00:27:48.640 not well understood is that almost all
00:27:51.159 of the top mobile shooter games are all
00:27:53.880 developed by Chinese companies
00:27:55.519 effectively right and so like um why is
00:27:59.919 that it's because they have a developed
00:28:04.519 deep expertise in Shooters and they also
00:28:08.880 there there's been like a phenomenon in
00:28:11.080 which like the 10cent teams and the
00:28:13.799 Chinese
00:28:15.279 teams have they're just the the work
00:28:19.880 ethic the culture they're just kind of
00:28:23.120 crazy compared to the West right like
00:28:24.880 the West right now if I'm just being
00:28:26.159 honest we're we're we're going to be
00:28:27.360 honest here right Y is is in kind of in
00:28:30.399 Decline where you don't have the same
00:28:32.919 work ethic the same kind of drive and I
00:28:36.519 think when you look at budgets today um
00:28:39.240 in the US budgets are like to make a
00:28:41.640 game now is like1 $300 million for like
00:28:44.080 a for an HD a PC or console game but in
00:28:47.039 China they're working 996 they've
00:28:49.960 identified specific strategic areas that
00:28:52.399 are important to them and then they just
00:28:54.440 go all in in those areas and mobile for
00:28:57.200 Shooters has been one of those areas and
00:28:59.039 so when you look at
00:29:01.159 every game that they work on you know
00:29:03.480 Call of Duty mobile is actually
00:29:05.440 developed by tent although they using
00:29:07.600 they're using the IP of of Activision
00:29:09.399 for example right and most of the I I
00:29:12.760 would say the the skill the technical
00:29:14.600 expertise currently exists in
00:29:16.640 China um one of the objectives of the
00:29:19.279 company that I started was to hopefully
00:29:22.480 do that here in India as
00:29:25.159 well but it's been tough why is
00:29:28.880 that I think that
00:29:31.480 um so the Indian game development
00:29:34.039 ecosystem is still early and if you look
00:29:36.240 at the historical context of the Indian
00:29:39.240 game development
00:29:40.519 ecosystem it's been one that's more that
00:29:44.399 has been more of a Services orientation
00:29:46.679 right and so the model in India in terms
00:29:49.600 of the historical context has been
00:29:52.200 taking games from the West at least for
00:29:54.320 mobile um that are in Decline and then
00:29:57.640 getting a team in India to live operate
00:29:59.559 it for um greater margins right for
00:30:03.000 lower cost and so because of that
00:30:06.600 historical context there hasn't been
00:30:09.240 like um a a culture a knowledge a skill
00:30:14.039 set of new game development in India yet
00:30:16.679 I'm sure it's burgeoning and there's
00:30:18.039 certainly a lot of you know successful
00:30:20.200 local game companies but has there been
00:30:23.080 a single game in India built in India
00:30:25.360 that has reached SK
00:30:28.679 in a true sense uh so I believe like the
00:30:32.760 game at the highest scale from a
00:30:34.519 downloads perspective is game Shan's lud
00:30:37.480 King but really it's gamean gamean yeah
00:30:42.200 gamean that's the Indian company yes yes
00:30:45.039 um when I look at the charts that's the
00:30:46.559 only game that I see come you know on on
00:30:49.399 the top
00:30:50.799 charts uh
00:30:52.799 globally but still it's largely an
00:30:55.120 Indian audience and because there's so
00:30:56.519 many Indians that love Ludo it it does
00:30:58.880 and what scale are we talking in terms
00:31:01.279 of Revenue coming out of the game I I
00:31:03.240 think that it has almost very little
00:31:05.279 Revenue right but in from a downloads
00:31:07.720 perspective it's very recently crossed a
00:31:10.360 billion downloads I think yeah in India
00:31:13.279 yeah but I monetization is a is a
00:31:16.159 challenge right and I think that's the
00:31:18.840 opportunity for India though right which
00:31:20.720 is like if India can develop a similar
00:31:24.760 kind of work ethic skill set
00:31:28.440 and um knowledge of monetization and how
00:31:30.960 to monetize more strongly then I think
00:31:32.919 India has a great opportunity you know
00:31:34.919 just to add to that nichel uh we've been
00:31:38.120 around for so long right so we've really
00:31:39.679 seen the whole evolution of the Indian
00:31:42.120 gaming industry right from late 90s to
00:31:45.760 where we are today in 24 I think one
00:31:48.080 more reason is that unlike China Etc
00:31:50.200 which had a large PC gaming culture uh
00:31:53.559 gaming cafes etc for a very long period
00:31:56.399 of time in has really been a mobile
00:31:59.519 gaming First Nation so most people
00:32:01.919 playing games the first experience has
00:32:04.320 been the mobile phone very casual gaming
00:32:07.919 so just that culture takes time to
00:32:10.559 develop even when you're thinking as a
00:32:12.679 game designer as a game developer
00:32:14.320 there's Evolution up to 2010 you would
00:32:16.799 not see that at all then you had zingas
00:32:19.279 of the world and Electronic Arts of the
00:32:20.799 world set up shop back offices in
00:32:22.720 Bangalore and Hyderabad Etc and you
00:32:27.159 started seeing some of those come out
00:32:29.480 set up some companies which are now
00:32:30.880 becoming successful so I think we're
00:32:32.159 going up that curve hopefully we'll
00:32:34.200 accelerate up that
00:32:36.120 curve but I think he was making a good
00:32:38.480 point Joseph is saying there is the
00:32:42.360 ecosystem in India is not capable of
00:32:45.679 producing a
00:32:47.559 game which can really compete on the
00:32:50.080 world stage what do you think India has
00:32:52.840 to change to change that I think there
00:32:55.240 has to be a few things that change I
00:32:58.159 would say probably the most important
00:33:00.760 thing is Talent so look I live in
00:33:04.720 Silicon Valley okay the smartest guys in
00:33:08.200 Silicon Valley are all Indian right and
00:33:11.600 so they certainly have like Indians can
00:33:15.200 be the smartest anywhere uh they're all
00:33:17.440 the you know the all the tech CEOs are
00:33:19.919 all all Indian in Silicon Valley think
00:33:22.039 that's the problem the Smart Ones are
00:33:23.440 going out of the country that's one of
00:33:24.799 the problems but I I think that gaming
00:33:27.159 in India has a double problem so first
00:33:31.480 yes uh there are a lot of people in
00:33:34.600 India when they get the an opportunity
00:33:36.600 to like 7x 10x their salary by going
00:33:40.440 abroad and they have that opportunity
00:33:43.159 because they've developed a skill set
00:33:44.919 here then they then they they'll jump I
00:33:47.639 think the other thing is more of a
00:33:49.240 cultural issue that um I have discovered
00:33:51.840 over the past few years that I've been
00:33:53.360 here in India which is that gaming at
00:33:56.919 least and you guys disagree with me but
00:33:59.480 in my experience it seems like gaming is
00:34:01.760 not looked upon favorably by a lot of
00:34:04.039 Indian parents and so when somebody
00:34:07.480 wants to go into gaming they really have
00:34:09.520 to want to go into gaming but otherwise
00:34:13.440 I think a lot of the parents and they
00:34:15.839 typically would want to go to join like
00:34:18.399 some Hightech firm an Amazon A Google a
00:34:21.079 Facebook a company like that rather than
00:34:24.199 join a gaming company and so the image
00:34:26.159 of a gaming company unlike like in the
00:34:28.199 west right like in the west joining a
00:34:30.719 game company is looked upon very
00:34:32.719 favorably for a number of reasons right
00:34:34.960 it's um
00:34:37.040 generally like leads in terms of
00:34:39.079 innovation a lot of the people that go
00:34:41.359 that are in gaming actually are highly
00:34:44.119 coveted by Facebook Google and the
00:34:46.480 high-tech companies but that kind of
00:34:50.399 feeling and that kind of that that kind
00:34:54.280 of um orientation towards gaming in the
00:34:57.000 US versus India is so different so then
00:35:00.160 you not only lose Talent overseas but
00:35:02.079 you also lose talent to other local
00:35:04.200 Indian Industries yeah and what do you
00:35:07.960 think should change in India to
00:35:12.520 culturally make gaming a career in
00:35:15.200 gaming look cool I think it's more of an
00:35:18.040 education right so I can I can name so
00:35:22.000 many of my friends that went from gaming
00:35:24.440 to join Facebook or Amazon or Netflix
00:35:29.240 and I think if some of the Indian
00:35:32.200 employees here or people who are
00:35:34.400 considering going into gaming understood
00:35:37.079 wow I didn't know that those companies
00:35:40.280 really sought people from gaming because
00:35:42.160 gaming is so Innovative and it is so
00:35:45.040 cross-disciplinary and you have to learn
00:35:46.760 a lot of complex skills when you're in
00:35:48.640 gaming uh so that is not well understood
00:35:51.880 here and I think that um the other thing
00:35:55.280 also that hasn't happened is that
00:35:58.440 because again the the historical context
00:36:02.200 of a lot of the Indian gaming companies
00:36:04.480 has been more on on the live Ops and
00:36:07.160 services
00:36:08.440 orientation
00:36:10.119 that there hasn't been the level of
00:36:12.640 poaching or of the high-tech companies
00:36:15.839 trying to hire people out of Indian
00:36:18.000 gaming companies yet and I think when
00:36:20.560 that happens and I think that happens
00:36:22.760 from people who have learned from a
00:36:25.240 company building new games that are very
00:36:27.599 successful right then they'll be poached
00:36:29.640 fairly regularly or or sought out sought
00:36:32.240 after I think that's when it becomes
00:36:34.359 more popular can you tell me a way uh
00:36:36.680 assume I'm a young 20-year-old Indian
00:36:40.400 boy girl and I want to get a job at Lea
00:36:43.800 games your company what should I
00:36:46.440 learn well I I think it would it would
00:36:49.520 depend on the specific role that you're
00:36:51.800 looking for so if it's product
00:36:53.920 management I would be looking for one
00:36:55.280 thing if it's engineering it'd be
00:36:56.720 completely different but I would say
00:36:59.319 like a general bit of advice for anyone
00:37:01.319 that's new looking to join a gaming
00:37:02.920 company is to essentially think outside
00:37:06.359 of the resume and to build I call it a
00:37:09.599 digital footprint but basically like
00:37:12.160 show me what you know show me what you
00:37:15.040 can do that's just not like lines on
00:37:17.640 your resume so whether it's projects or
00:37:21.200 whether it's like blog posts where I can
00:37:24.400 see how you think because I will say you
00:37:27.599 know having been recruiting here for the
00:37:29.640 last three and a half years and having
00:37:32.280 interviewed and you know looked at
00:37:34.720 thousands and thousands of résumés I
00:37:36.680 would say that most people generally
00:37:39.319 don't stand out because they don't
00:37:41.359 actually show me anything that they've
00:37:43.880 done that that really tells me that they
00:37:45.880 care about gaming that they've thought
00:37:47.359 about gaming so anyone that has a blog
00:37:50.560 post a project that they've put onto a
00:37:53.079 website any kind of additional kind of
00:37:55.079 digital footprint outside of their
00:37:56.640 resume
00:37:58.480 really shows me that this is somebody
00:38:00.359 that I need to pay attention to so I'll
00:38:02.200 absolutely look at a resume with like
00:38:05.160 links to projects blog posts YouTube
00:38:08.079 videos anything of that nature more than
00:38:10.440 just a another resume right interesting
00:38:13.720 would you like to tell us more about
00:38:15.000 yourself Joseph like generally live I'm
00:38:17.880 a guy that's trying to do something
00:38:20.359 meaningful before I die so uh you know I
00:38:25.359 I think um so in terms of my career I I
00:38:28.359 I kind of kind of um worked in software
00:38:32.200 development initially uh then I moved
00:38:34.520 into management consulting then um
00:38:37.359 around 2010 2011 started a gaming
00:38:40.839 company
00:38:42.000 unsuccessfully um then went into like
00:38:44.960 kind of Consulting with big Asian
00:38:46.560 Publishers um trying to uh you know
00:38:49.680 publish games mobile games for the
00:38:51.680 Western Market why do they call them
00:38:54.000 Publishers uh Publishers generally U
00:38:57.040 Finance and distribute games okay and
00:39:00.160 and so their model is to like not do the
00:39:02.319 development they work with another
00:39:04.040 company that actually develops the games
00:39:06.160 but then they would help get those games
00:39:08.040 launched into market and distributed and
00:39:10.839 so there's a financing component but
00:39:12.520 there's also a distribution and
00:39:13.880 marketing component as well can you give
00:39:15.200 me the example of a publisher and a game
00:39:17.400 developer the
00:39:19.319 distinction sure so uh for example I
00:39:23.119 mean I think Crafton recent like just
00:39:25.400 just to kind of um
00:39:27.880 give you a very live example Crafton
00:39:29.839 worked with a company called zepto lab
00:39:32.319 that has a game for uh the global market
00:39:35.160 and they worked with them to make an
00:39:36.359 Indian specific version of the game so I
00:39:38.839 don't know what the exact deal terms
00:39:40.160 were but I assume that they would pay
00:39:41.720 for part or full
00:39:44.119 development they would have a revenue
00:39:45.960 share with them may potentially give
00:39:47.640 them a a guarantee of some kind some
00:39:49.599 initial you know payment and then uh and
00:39:52.760 then it would be up to Crafton to
00:39:54.200 actually market and distribute the game
00:39:55.960 the developer after they finished in the
00:39:57.839 game would would either like in for a
00:40:00.960 premium game they'd be done for a live
00:40:03.280 operated free-to-play game they they
00:40:04.920 would continue to operate the game and
00:40:06.720 then sharing sharing the success of the
00:40:08.359 game through a revenue share interesting
00:40:12.079 and when I read that you were at Sega
00:40:14.640 games by Sega do you mean that console
00:40:17.440 which we used to have back in the yeah
00:40:19.200 so I remember playing that so after
00:40:23.119 after I I kind of did Consulting I
00:40:25.960 joined a company called fun plus and I
00:40:29.160 actually had a pretty big success and
00:40:32.400 the model that I learned at fun plus is
00:40:34.079 the model that I'm actually trying to
00:40:35.119 bring to India and so at fun plus we had
00:40:38.560 something that I call a leads based
00:40:40.160 model but essentially we took at that
00:40:43.800 time a fairly inexperienced team in
00:40:46.160 Beijing and this was during a period
00:40:48.359 like 200 I don't know 145 or so when
00:40:51.800 China was not as dominant as it is today
00:40:55.240 and uh we had a team in Beijing we
00:40:57.599 brought experts from around the world in
00:40:59.520 various areas that the team was not
00:41:02.000 strong in we brought them to China had
00:41:04.400 them teach the team and then we
00:41:05.800 developed uh games out of out of China
00:41:08.920 the game that I developed was called
00:41:10.119 King of avyon but that turned out to be
00:41:12.839 a pretty big success and then
00:41:15.839 after uh after fun plus I joined Sega um
00:41:20.359 basically in their mobile games division
00:41:22.560 so U basically was Sega the machine on
00:41:24.839 which we used to Contra Mario and all
00:41:26.720 this that's right yeah yeah SE I've
00:41:28.960 played a lot of that Contra May Brothers
00:41:32.880 yeah Sega exited um Hardware uh the
00:41:36.440 console business a number of years ago
00:41:38.240 but still develop develops um games
00:41:41.400 through a number of different game
00:41:43.200 studios and is actually Diversified in
00:41:46.240 like hotels Pachinko and things like
00:41:48.119 that like a lot of other things as well
00:41:50.839 you know funnily enough when you said
00:41:52.839 when you mentioned earlier gaming
00:41:54.760 centers when I was a kid growing up I'm
00:41:58.680 thinking Agee six or seven yeah they
00:42:01.720 used to be gaming centers where there
00:42:03.400 would be Sega machines and you would pay
00:42:05.359 per hour and play Contra for an hour
00:42:08.760 arcade machines arcade centers yeah yeah
00:42:11.560 um oh just to finish the loop uh I after
00:42:14.680 Sega I joined NBC Universal MH which is
00:42:17.440 a big Media company and then started
00:42:20.119 this company about 3 and a half years
00:42:23.680 ago okay moving to the youngest one here
00:42:27.520 yeah that's what I was thinking I've had
00:42:28.880 the shortest professional run in the
00:42:30.720 gaming industry until now your online
00:42:34.760 name is 8bit thug yeah where was that
00:42:39.119 inspired from do you feel like you're a
00:42:40.760 thug in real life uh not really people
00:42:43.880 do think that I'm a little bit of like
00:42:45.920 have a bullish nature in the gaming
00:42:47.559 industry but that's not true I think
00:42:49.800 that's just because you know things that
00:42:51.760 I've been luckily been able to do which
00:42:53.480 I'm very proud of across the last six
00:42:55.280 years the name story is very similar
00:42:57.160 simple 8bit was my clan name in a game
00:42:59.200 called Clash Royale which I was heavily
00:43:01.000 invested into as a Casual Gamer not
00:43:03.200 professionally I was pursuing my CA
00:43:04.640 inter and I had something to do in uh to
00:43:07.520 get because I don't want to step out
00:43:09.079 spend a lot of time studying so that was
00:43:11.319 a game I was heavily invested into I
00:43:13.200 made a clan ebit that's how the prefix
00:43:15.839 of my name came in and Thug is actually
00:43:18.440 a short form of thug life which is also
00:43:22.440 uh from a song from a movie called
00:43:23.880 dictator College days nothing to do I
00:43:26.200 said it's a good night good name you
00:43:27.839 know getting fascinated by movies so and
00:43:30.520 then uh actually when I used to play
00:43:32.559 pubg mobile it did not take 8bit thug
00:43:34.559 life as my full name so I left out life
00:43:36.839 and it's 8bit Thug and rest is history
00:43:39.200 why AP 8bit my team name uh then why did
00:43:42.760 you pick eight bit for your team okay so
00:43:45.240 interesting question when I was playing
00:43:46.800 Clash Royale there were eight people
00:43:48.599 from across the world met who met in the
00:43:51.240 game who founded 8bit so there was one
00:43:54.240 guy from Austria couple from uh us one
00:43:57.440 from Australia so we used to call
00:43:58.640 ourselves eight bits of the entire Clan
00:44:00.839 system and then we all just uh fell off
00:44:04.160 they fell off and I just continued the
00:44:05.640 name and establish I I thought that
00:44:08.000 thank you I thought that you are like
00:44:10.319 you know fan of uh classic classic games
00:44:13.640 not really I've always high graphic
00:44:16.200 intensive games yeah so I'm going to ask
00:44:18.720 you most questions cuz you're
00:44:21.200 the protagonist of the Indian gaming
00:44:25.119 story in a way or the career in gaming
00:44:27.280 right you came from a non-gaming
00:44:29.559 background and today you're a
00:44:31.200 professional gamer in India so tell us
00:44:33.520 the story from the
00:44:35.359 beginning and then I'll ask you things
00:44:37.599 like money opportunity all of that so
00:44:40.040 how did you enter game right so I'll go
00:44:42.720 back to the beginning uh actually I was
00:44:45.640 I come from a middle class family my
00:44:47.040 father is a chartered accountant my
00:44:48.520 sister is a chartered accountant I was
00:44:49.920 pursuing you're going you're going to
00:44:51.400 get trolled for calling chared account
00:44:53.079 in middle class but continue no yeah but
00:44:57.240 it is a story when I realize right now
00:44:59.400 that how why was in the middle class
00:45:01.839 segment when my father was a CA but
00:45:03.800 that's a different story and I was
00:45:05.640 purchasing CA my life goal was inspired
00:45:08.079 from Ric rashan zmd investment banker B
00:45:10.680 Goldman Sachs I was doing CFL I cleared
00:45:13.040 CFA level one I pursued frm I cleared
00:45:15.680 its level one but I did all of this when
00:45:18.280 I was shy of 24 like six years back so I
00:45:21.640 realized and I used to play a lot of
00:45:23.240 games but not professionally just play
00:45:25.240 games watch some of the biggest
00:45:26.960 streamers at that point like ninja
00:45:28.839 shroud and a game called fortnite which
00:45:31.440 is still one of the very popular titles
00:45:33.319 caught my attention I don't know why
00:45:36.480 like today I have an answer why people
00:45:37.760 watch games but then I did not have an
00:45:39.240 answer and I used to wake up at 6:30
00:45:40.880 a.m. Indian time in Bangalore just to
00:45:43.440 watch Ninja or this guys go live because
00:45:45.359 of the time zone difference they used to
00:45:46.920 why I still don't get it when I can
00:45:50.240 play I guess one can say the same about
00:45:52.800 sport that's what that's the answer the
00:45:55.160 question itself is the answer I have
00:45:56.640 never watched anybody's stream but I'm
00:45:59.720 trying to wrap my head around why is it
00:46:01.800 so much fun to watch someone play a
00:46:03.960 video game uh I think the nature of
00:46:06.520 video games that's being played the
00:46:08.280 competitiveness that it brings the
00:46:09.640 storyline that it brings I think a lot
00:46:11.200 of great greatest content creators are
00:46:13.000 great storytellers so they bring a
00:46:14.920 different angle to apart from the story
00:46:16.760 that is within the game so those are a
00:46:18.760 few things that really holds the
00:46:20.160 audience together then also the
00:46:21.640 competitive side is the biggest part of
00:46:23.400 so wait somebody's watching a game right
00:46:25.440 there is a content creator on top of the
00:46:27.400 game who's giving commentary right and
00:46:29.319 you're watching the commentary right and
00:46:31.119 you because you know the way I think uh
00:46:34.240 when you play story mode games story
00:46:35.520 mode games are games which have uh you
00:46:37.000 know a particular story and once you
00:46:38.200 finish the story the game is done you
00:46:39.839 don't need to play it again I think a
00:46:41.760 lot of greatest content creators that
00:46:43.440 I've seen are big Gamers they are
00:46:45.240 excellent storytellers uh I mean like
00:46:47.480 the way examples I think if you look at
00:46:50.040 uh a story mode game something like God
00:46:52.040 of War a very popular game way back in
00:46:55.000 my school days as well I used to play it
00:46:56.359 on the PS too so once the story is over
00:46:58.680 it's done it's done the game is done and
00:47:00.359 then you move on to the next one yeah so
00:47:02.800 and then there are games like GTA that
00:47:04.200 go on forever then there have been games
00:47:05.920 like Grand thft Auto that go on forever
00:47:08.359 so that's one part of watching streams
00:47:10.800 or content the second part is obviously
00:47:12.680 when you play games like bgmi or
00:47:14.359 valerant which have a competitive angle
00:47:15.839 to it which have a win uh condition to
00:47:18.079 it so you know when some of the famous
00:47:20.640 names who have represented India who
00:47:22.960 have played tournaments won in won in
00:47:25.400 those tournaments and when they go and
00:47:27.000 show it to the public how it's done I
00:47:28.640 think that really catches the attention
00:47:30.200 of a lot of people I think it has
00:47:32.440 evolved over the last 3 four years where
00:47:34.160 a lot of fun elements because it's a
00:47:35.720 very you know these games like bgm where
00:47:37.920 you playing as a squad it has a lot of
00:47:39.640 fun element to it because you are
00:47:40.800 connecting socially to each other you
00:47:42.280 are talking so this conversation comes
00:47:44.200 from I mean like why did we used like I
00:47:46.640 have even I have watched Kiti what was
00:47:49.119 it it was just this conversation
00:47:52.680 28 it was my era no but my era also but
00:47:56.520 I was in class one now but you must have
00:47:58.359 seen the later tuls and Mi not the
00:48:00.400 original ones yeah possible but I've
00:48:02.440 seen all the deaths I've seen five Mi I
00:48:04.240 guess not SMY Rani no I've seen Smitty
00:48:06.480 Rani yeah but yeah so she was so good
00:48:09.040 right yeah she was good definitely so I
00:48:11.559 believe that that's the reason why
00:48:13.079 people watch games it's just about they
00:48:15.480 play the game now they relate to it it's
00:48:17.559 like Cricket you have played Cricket
00:48:19.000 everyone has played or at least heard a
00:48:20.680 lot about Cricket now you're getting to
00:48:22.520 when you see IPL you get to see a
00:48:24.359 different angle of cricket believe me
00:48:25.720 T20 World Cup has never same as IPL the
00:48:27.800 Masala that comes with IPL is is the
00:48:29.839 reason why so many people are glued to
00:48:31.800 it like you know it becomes a festival
00:48:33.359 in India I think that's the case with
00:48:35.720 people watching gaming streamers you
00:48:37.359 know it becomes a different version of
00:48:39.680 that game for them and while you're
00:48:41.280 watching a stream are you all talking to
00:48:43.040 each other uh while I'm watching uh if
00:48:45.880 I'm a viewer I'll be chatting with other
00:48:47.480 people who are watching my stream that's
00:48:48.880 what happens on YouTube and twitch or
00:48:51.000 loco as a matter of fact uh but as a
00:48:53.920 player if I'm playing a solo person
00:48:55.359 story mode game then I might be uh not
00:48:57.440 chatting with anyone else but I'm
00:48:58.599 playing Squad games I'll be chatting
00:48:59.799 with my teammates I'm going to blatantly
00:49:01.920 ask a question as a Indian full-time
00:49:05.640 gamer how much do successful
00:49:09.400 streamers Gamers make in India how
00:49:13.119 viable is it as a profession profession
00:49:15.520 I think it's very skewed to be very
00:49:17.119 honest the top Gamers and top streamers
00:49:19.359 make a lot of money and there like if
00:49:21.839 you go to the bottom of the chart people
00:49:23.359 are not making money at all describe lot
00:49:26.359 who number one million dollars
00:49:28.240 comfortably in a year this is a gamer
00:49:30.760 this is a gaming content creator it has
00:49:32.839 to be a streamer at the same who's the
00:49:34.079 top in India uh I think it could be
00:49:36.440 mortal Scout mythpat like few million
00:49:39.839 subscribers on YouTube subscribers then
00:49:42.119 we have techno Gamers they are
00:49:44.119 comfortably making you know uh money
00:49:46.400 around that number and this money comes
00:49:48.160 from Brand endorsements plus content I
00:49:50.559 think Brands really form a big chunk
00:49:53.000 YouTube content yeah YouTube content
00:49:54.559 YouTube or Instagram is it PewDiePie I I
00:49:57.680 remember looking at YouTube for a long
00:49:59.559 time PewDiePie had the largest
00:50:01.240 subscribers this is like that sort of
00:50:04.000 yes he he has been a inherent gamer like
00:50:06.160 he has played games for quite a bit on
00:50:08.240 his channel so something of that kind
00:50:10.799 okay remove content
00:50:12.760 creators gamer gamer uh gamer gamer I
00:50:15.920 would say people who have
00:50:19.200 played at the highest level of Esports
00:50:22.200 that is playing official tournaments for
00:50:24.520 a franchise or not a franchise we don't
00:50:26.319 have franch but for a registered Esports
00:50:28.839 team I think they could be doing close
00:50:32.200 to 30 35 lakhs a year by just playing
00:50:35.640 games professionally and how many of
00:50:37.280 these people are there thousands uh not
00:50:41.079 really I don't think at 35 lak 6,000 it
00:50:43.760 could be the top
00:50:45.559 150 right because it's very
00:50:49.119 limited where else in this domain can
00:50:51.920 young people make money in India
00:50:53.599 streamer gamer then okay so now this is
00:50:56.440 where I wanted to come to the convention
00:50:57.960 that you know you having with Joseph
00:50:59.760 what I feel that India does not really
00:51:03.040 so if you look at Indian market gaming
00:51:04.920 boomed in India 2019 mid it's exactly
00:51:07.240 when it started booming and covid
00:51:09.079 happened and it the gaming industry just
00:51:10.720 blew off the lids I believe if you
00:51:13.000 compare Indian gaming uh trajectory to
00:51:15.799 Western and European market like
00:51:17.280 European and American Market you realize
00:51:19.280 we paced in we like you know the graph
00:51:22.640 was very steep we moved at a very fast
00:51:24.520 pace we paced really well game in India
00:51:27.040 grew by lips and Bounds compared to the
00:51:28.799 PACE at which other countries were
00:51:30.000 coming in but that is the uh consumption
00:51:33.640 part of it India has surpassed us and
00:51:36.160 Brazil in terms of mobile game downloads
00:51:38.720 India has 568 million online Gamers so
00:51:41.520 numbers are great but there was a big
00:51:43.640 void in the system which was this that
00:51:45.839 we did not have the proper uh correct
00:51:48.480 roles defined people did not know what
00:51:50.640 jobs are available but people do not
00:51:52.079 know apart from being a mortal or a
00:51:53.720 scout or becoming a gameer there other
00:51:56.200 100 domains where you can enter the
00:51:57.920 gaming industry so I believe that we are
00:52:00.160 too young for that the industry is too
00:52:01.680 young for that India will produce the
00:52:04.359 best of games in coming years but it's
00:52:06.160 not going to happen at least for the
00:52:07.839 next 5 years why I believe that building
00:52:10.799 games are super expensive uh from what I
00:52:13.440 have studied I might be wrong and
00:52:14.960 someone can correct me I don't believe
00:52:17.079 there were enough funds in India funding
00:52:19.240 game development in India uh gaming just
00:52:22.040 like all the gaming funds even craftting
00:52:23.960 incubator was announced early this year
00:52:25.599 and then there's lum and then I think uh
00:52:27.599 even MPL is building a game but all of
00:52:29.480 this happened in the last 3 4 years so
00:52:31.599 if there were dreams you know when we
00:52:33.160 talk about Exodus Talent Exodus from
00:52:35.680 India if there were dreams eight years
00:52:37.319 back about building game in India who
00:52:38.559 would fund it that's the point you know
00:52:40.960 I was just speaking to your uh one of
00:52:43.000 your teammates I feel like money always
00:52:45.520 follows
00:52:47.640 Talent it does but then uh I believe
00:52:51.000 that there needs to be a base for that
00:52:52.400 ecosystem I mean like 8 years ago if
00:52:55.040 someone would have gone and said I need
00:52:56.880 $2 million or $3 million to build a game
00:52:59.880 no one would have given that person that
00:53:01.440 money I believe that I could be wrong
00:53:03.359 here but that's what I feel because I
00:53:04.640 watched the industry only for the last 7
00:53:06.040 eight years so I think that is the
00:53:07.480 problem so I think right now it's doing
00:53:10.200 good the money has just started to come
00:53:11.799 in there are small Studios that are
00:53:13.280 trying to work really hard and we'll
00:53:15.119 have a good game and we'll have that
00:53:16.480 point where we hold India's talent to
00:53:17.960 India and build good games and also if
00:53:20.119 you look at it even he was mentioning it
00:53:22.040 that China has a stronghold tensent
00:53:24.480 makes games that no one else can do it
00:53:27.160 that is one problem that the entire
00:53:28.880 world is facing so I believe that India
00:53:30.720 will make its Mark but we need to give
00:53:32.280 it time to breathe like let it breathe
00:53:34.200 let this industry breath we have talents
00:53:36.119 we have people who are now keen on
00:53:37.400 developing games because now they see
00:53:38.640 the money coming in I believe uh you
00:53:41.599 said Money Follows talent I believe in
00:53:43.480 India Talent goes where the money lies
00:53:46.359 both ways I think both ways actually
00:53:47.839 both ways yeah but I would say that if
00:53:50.599 you look at Turkey for example right you
00:53:52.920 you had a few Studios that had pretty
00:53:55.200 big success there Peak games now dream
00:53:57.040 games and then now there's a flood of
00:53:59.599 money rushing to Turkey right and so
00:54:01.960 similarly if India had just a few
00:54:04.880 successes on on a global stage I'm sure
00:54:08.240 there would be a A Rush of of money that
00:54:11.280 would come here as well there's already
00:54:12.440 a number of global funds right so there
00:54:15.280 hasn't even been one outside of Ludo
00:54:17.480 there's been Raji which did pretty well
00:54:19.480 uh Raji it's a game that
00:54:22.240 was but then it's a Indie it's a Indie
00:54:25.480 but it did okay and I believe that what
00:54:27.920 now indust is super gaming is building
00:54:30.200 indust it's a very promising title even
00:54:33.200 MPL is doing ugw underworld gang wars so
00:54:36.480 let's see I think there are games coming
00:54:38.040 out uh and I believe that India will
00:54:41.160 have great games come out because I've
00:54:43.200 seen Indian gamers are buil different we
00:54:45.599 haven't we haven't had our you know the
00:54:47.480 cricket moment of 83 yet for Indian
00:54:49.160 Esports but once that happens the boom
00:54:51.359 should come in are the incumbent Indian
00:54:53.599 market leaders helping out like nitish
00:54:55.760 on your right
00:54:58.380 [Applause]
00:55:00.079 definitely uh I got great help from nwin
00:55:02.880 and I'm shooting for Crafton tomorrow I
00:55:05.040 have a shoot at 600 a.m. okay so if I
00:55:08.040 were a 20
00:55:09.880 yearold young guy or
00:55:12.559 girl how do I make money in gaming I
00:55:15.000 love gaming I play it in my free time my
00:55:17.920 parents and my peers are giving me a
00:55:20.160 hard time saying that I'm wasting time
00:55:23.000 and money and resources gaming what is
00:55:26.119 the path to build a successful career
00:55:29.480 path of least resistance in gaming uh so
00:55:33.200 I'll talk about the path to becoming a
00:55:34.920 gamer very hard truth if you're 20 year
00:55:37.839 old I have said said it on record and I
00:55:39.720 always say it gaming cannot be the only
00:55:42.480 that you are pursuing in India right now
00:55:44.640 you are you need to have a backup you
00:55:46.640 need to have a backup plan if you are a
00:55:48.880 come from a business family you're
00:55:50.039 pursing your studies you need to
00:55:51.200 continue doing that continue gaming as a
00:55:53.760 passion until you are at the right place
00:55:57.640 in front of the right person and at the
00:55:59.440 right stage where you get to show your
00:56:01.520 gaming Talent when I talk about India's
00:56:03.599 top Gamers professional Gamers or
00:56:05.839 content creators I believe they are
00:56:08.400 nothing there could be hundreds
00:56:10.200 thousands lacks of more skilled Gamers
00:56:12.480 and better content creator sitting at
00:56:13.960 home but it's so much about luck that
00:56:17.200 you they were at the right place at the
00:56:18.760 right time the timing matters so much I
00:56:20.760 wouldn't have been sitting if I wouldn't
00:56:22.319 had taken my that break for a year from
00:56:24.079 my academic career plus that uh the game
00:56:27.079 I started streaming on 20th jly but if
00:56:28.680 you don't do it full-time how do you
00:56:29.960 compete with the international ones
00:56:31.440 doing it fulltime in coming to the
00:56:34.079 international stage is a very very long
00:56:35.520 story if you are actually getting a
00:56:36.880 chance to compete that means you have
00:56:38.160 made it nationally I'm saying to make it
00:56:40.440 nationally also it's a very big luck
00:56:41.920 Factor because in so to explain what is
00:56:45.280 talent I know in cricket Talent is
00:56:50.079 timing time maybe you have more time
00:56:52.839 before you hit a ball right body
00:56:56.319 physical strength all of that what
00:56:59.319 distinguishes One Gamer from another in
00:57:01.880 terms of talent understanding of the
00:57:04.000 game the biggest thing I think every
00:57:05.960 game which is competitive in nature has
00:57:08.200 so many strategical aspects to it that
00:57:10.920 you need to give it real time uh to
00:57:13.960 understand it and believe me a person
00:57:16.000 who gives lot of time there so there's a
00:57:18.119 thing called Meta Meta is like what is
00:57:20.200 something that that is dominating the
00:57:21.920 which strategy is dominating the game
00:57:23.400 right now so how does a met change what
00:57:26.720 is that strategy that changes there is
00:57:28.039 someone spending so much time on the
00:57:29.680 game to bring out something different
00:57:32.799 that gets him a win condition like you
00:57:34.359 know he starts winning games and that's
00:57:35.680 when everyone else adopts it so I think
00:57:38.400 Talent is about that strategical input
00:57:40.880 that you are bringing to a game apart
00:57:42.920 from that if you're playing a first
00:57:44.359 person shooter or shooting game reflexes
00:57:46.280 matter how fast do you react to
00:57:48.119 situation so I had an another agenda
00:57:50.079 today like an ulterior motive
00:57:52.359 almost our audience who we speak to are
00:57:57.160 upcoming entrepreneurs in India who are
00:58:00.280 trying to build a business we try and
00:58:02.440 give them information about different
00:58:04.640 Industries uh we have a grand program
00:58:07.079 where we try and give them some funding
00:58:09.119 somebody really young who wants to build
00:58:11.760 something with promise and we also try
00:58:14.599 and connect them from a community
00:58:17.680 standpoint so we will put you guys in
00:58:19.559 front of a bunch of really inquisitive
00:58:22.480 people who want to be in gaming and make
00:58:24.920 it a career
00:58:26.640 so the first thing I wanted to know is
00:58:29.760 where is Young India spending time you
00:58:33.039 guys have the gaming
00:58:34.319 lens uh if I were to make the
00:58:38.200 Assumption not assumption I think
00:58:40.200 there's data for this people under the
00:58:42.880 age of 13 India are spending a lot more
00:58:46.200 time on social media they're spending a
00:58:48.720 lot more time on gaming they're spending
00:58:51.559 less time watching TV they're spending
00:58:55.000 strangely less time watching sport so
00:58:58.039 the amount of time somebody really young
00:59:00.520 is spending on Cricket is lesser than it
00:59:03.319 was 10 years ago 15 years
00:59:05.799 ago they're spending lesser time playing
00:59:08.480 physical sports or physical activities
00:59:11.680 print media is going down online media
00:59:15.160 is going up but not enough to totally
00:59:19.039 compensate for print media going down so
00:59:21.839 if I'm a young 16-year-old
00:59:24.200 boy I have 8 10 12 threee hours in a day
00:59:29.960 let's say
00:59:30.960 8 how much time of that 8 is going
00:59:34.720 there today where was it yesterday and
00:59:38.119 where will it be at tomorrow this is
00:59:40.680 essential for anybody looking to build
00:59:43.160 any kind of company in India because we
00:59:45.559 need to know where the youth are going
00:59:47.079 to be spending time tomorrow so I'll go
00:59:49.319 to each one of you and we don't have to
00:59:51.319 like narrow our lens down to India you
00:59:53.760 could talk about America you could talk
00:59:55.480 about southeast
00:59:57.400 Asia uh who would like to go first n no
01:00:00.200 sure I can I can go first so I think uh
01:00:03.760 if you go back if I go back to my own
01:00:06.920 generation right and if I go back to my
01:00:09.440 school days or when I was 15 or 16 or
01:00:13.319 even
01:00:14.520 younger cricket was where a life would
01:00:17.200 revolve around yeah right you would play
01:00:20.000 cricket all the time with your building
01:00:22.440 friends you would watch cricket I
01:00:25.200 remember in school would even wake up at
01:00:26.760 5: in the morning to watch a test match
01:00:29.280 happening in South Africa or Australia
01:00:31.119 before going to school right your whole
01:00:32.680 life revolved around this thing called
01:00:35.200 Cricket I especially think the younger
01:00:37.799 you're getting and your question was
01:00:39.079 below 30 right but I have a thesis here
01:00:41.760 that the younger you get the velocity or
01:00:45.480 the amount of time being spent on gaming
01:00:48.079 is increasing right so 15 16 year old
01:00:51.520 today is probably spending maximum time
01:00:54.319 on social media
01:00:56.799 some on Sports and a decent amount of
01:00:58.640 time on gaming the stats say 40% of
01:01:01.200 their time on social media yeah and
01:01:03.000 maybe 30% on gaming but the rate of
01:01:06.839 change in time spent is going up in
01:01:09.880 social media even faster than gaming no
01:01:12.640 but if you go even little younger I'm
01:01:14.960 saying from experience two young kids
01:01:17.440 who are below 12 social media they're
01:01:20.640 not even allowed to be honest a lot but
01:01:23.240 the rest of their time is only gaming
01:01:25.280 and what games and so to they Evolved
01:01:27.960 first they used to play my games which
01:01:30.240 was kopia which is very popular so I
01:01:32.160 learned Shameless plug I like how
01:01:36.200 you years trained no
01:01:39.440 now but uh now they've moved to
01:01:43.039 Minecraft right so both the kids are
01:01:45.319 playing Minecraft okay sitting next to
01:01:47.640 each other they wake up at 6:00 in the
01:01:49.200 morning I wake them up sharp at 6:00 in
01:01:50.839 the morning but they would leave for
01:01:51.799 school at 7:00 the first thing they
01:01:53.760 would do is pick up their respective
01:01:55.000 iPads and start Minecraft so 6 to 6:30
01:01:57.880 is the gaming time there wake up alarm
01:02:01.559 you can say so they'll do Minecraft but
01:02:04.079 the more important thing is on YouTube
01:02:06.559 or on the TV they're oning YouTube and
01:02:09.119 watching Minecraft videos they're
01:02:11.359 watching Minecraft
01:02:12.640 streamers then my daughter recently had
01:02:14.839 a birthday so I asked her what birthday
01:02:16.279 theme do you want and she wanted to do
01:02:19.480 how old is your daughter she's just on
01:02:20.920 seven she wanted a theme she said appm I
01:02:24.240 didn't even know what is appm so I go
01:02:25.720 with it is supposedly a girl called
01:02:28.119 Jessica in the US who's a popular
01:02:30.160 Minecraft
01:02:31.119 streamer and she wanted a whole birthday
01:02:33.279 theme around that streamer right and you
01:02:36.880 have merchandise around that streamer
01:02:38.319 now so she wants me to buy that for so
01:02:40.240 whole what I realized is for these
01:02:42.119 younger kids what cricket was for us has
01:02:45.480 been replaced by Gaming with their
01:02:47.640 friends the topic is of discussion is
01:02:49.520 gaming what are you doing which game Etc
01:02:51.640 right it's all revolving around gaming
01:02:54.000 and therefore I'm betting
01:02:56.440 that as this generation grows up which
01:03:00.000 is your today's 5-year-old 10y old into
01:03:04.000 the next four five years where gaming
01:03:06.520 will be the by far the primary uh source
01:03:10.240 of but why not social media cuz when
01:03:12.319 they grow to be 16 you'll allow them and
01:03:15.000 they'll graduate to that right probably
01:03:16.920 they will but I think they will still be
01:03:19.039 far more ingrain because they've done
01:03:20.520 this gaming from age of two my daughter
01:03:22.880 started gaming at 1 and a half so I
01:03:25.119 think it's come very naturally to them
01:03:26.640 rather than adopting to it as a lot of
01:03:28.319 the current generation has so if I am 20
01:03:31.319 and I want to sell something when I'm 25
01:03:34.839 I'm building a business I'm an
01:03:36.160 entrepreneur want to be
01:03:37.799 entrepreneur do you think I should focus
01:03:39.920 on gaming social
01:03:42.119 media
01:03:43.839 sport movies TV what should what
01:03:47.599 audience should I be building for
01:03:49.319 towards if you want to sell to the
01:03:51.640 audience yeah I think gaming continue I
01:03:54.559 think gaming is a great place because
01:03:56.079 the kind of Engagement you have huh uh
01:03:59.000 on gaming right when you're playing a
01:04:00.559 game you're very focused and interacting
01:04:02.799 with the game versus watching it
01:04:05.680 passively let's say
01:04:07.799 watching content passively right so if
01:04:10.799 you're selling to a gamer uh it's a it's
01:04:14.359 a big potential which is why something
01:04:16.520 we've been looking at is what this new
01:04:18.160 word coming up gcommerce right which is
01:04:21.359 uh selling via games is a new trend
01:04:25.119 which is starting to pick up and we'll
01:04:27.520 see where it goes but yeah I think I
01:04:30.240 think and how do I sell to a gamer say
01:04:31.920 I'm starting a chocolate company and I
01:04:34.760 want to sell I think the gaming crowd
01:04:37.440 will be three times as big as they are
01:04:39.359 today in 10 years how do you start
01:04:41.359 selling to them do you go to Discord
01:04:43.319 Twitch streaming platforms chat
01:04:46.920 boxes I think the best way is in game
01:04:49.520 monetization you know I think that if if
01:04:51.799 the crowd is shift the trend is Shifting
01:04:53.559 towards spending more time on games they
01:04:55.319 would want to Market it inside the game
01:04:58.240 I mean like if you look at hero your
01:05:00.160 recent partnership that you announced
01:05:01.680 yesterday now I I'm guessing hero will
01:05:03.880 bring their bike skins within the game
01:05:06.039 and if they are targeting it for the
01:05:07.480 zenzi the 125r model I think they've hit
01:05:10.440 the right cord because like we see
01:05:12.599 people are not spending time on TV if
01:05:14.640 people are not watching cricket and if
01:05:16.279 they're spending time on social media
01:05:18.160 and gaming then you just split your
01:05:20.760 spends into the two things you have your
01:05:23.240 ads running and then you have things
01:05:24.760 that they're spending time on integrated
01:05:26.200 into it so I believe that is the best
01:05:28.319 way to go about it but you will have
01:05:29.680 more insight yeah yeah I I have a very
01:05:31.440 good example like uh my kids love to
01:05:34.520 watch Mr Beast the YouTube crazy kids
01:05:37.880 kids going getting crazy and then I
01:05:40.480 think he has built some Brands chocolate
01:05:44.319 yeah a festival Festival chocolate they
01:05:47.680 my kids doesn't really remember hsh uh
01:05:50.720 but kids remember fist Tu so when I went
01:05:53.319 to GDC just uh few weeks back they
01:05:56.960 request just only one thing buy lots of
01:05:59.839 vegetable chocolate uh so that they can
01:06:02.720 have it alsoo also they can give out to
01:06:04.599 friends so it's it's also kind of like
01:06:06.760 showing kind of status like I I have
01:06:09.599 fbls which can be bought from the US and
01:06:12.760 then give it to friends so it's big I
01:06:16.240 pay like th000 bucks for a fet taste the
01:06:19.680 same like am
01:06:20.799 CH they same they same but different
01:06:24.079 labels and n I've got a very different
01:06:26.960 perspective N I think one other way to
01:06:29.160 think about opportunity for a young
01:06:31.039 person is I and certainly I think one
01:06:33.920 way to think about it is the current
01:06:35.599 kind of demand side but the other way to
01:06:38.039 think about it is more on the supply
01:06:39.839 side and also in terms of new demand and
01:06:42.880 I think the one thing that cannot be
01:06:45.680 ignored in my opinion and I believe
01:06:47.760 we're living in a very unprecedented
01:06:49.640 time is essentially Ai and if you see
01:06:52.799 the growth of AI today and we we're at
01:06:56.000 GDC the number of people building tools
01:06:59.039 and capabilities with AI is incredible
01:07:01.599 it's moving so fast so if I were to
01:07:04.880 advise somebody younger I would say that
01:07:09.039 in my opinion I think AI is going to be
01:07:11.400 as big as the internet um potentially
01:07:14.079 bigger in terms of impact to society and
01:07:16.920 so from that lens I think that you you
01:07:19.039 want to be thinking about a cross
01:07:21.079 strategy meaning you want to learn AI as
01:07:24.240 a base but then cross with something
01:07:26.599 else explain what does that mean for
01:07:29.520 example AI cross gaming so you're going
01:07:31.720 to learn AI but then you're also going
01:07:33.599 to develop depth in a different industry
01:07:36.400 or sector so that you can take the AI
01:07:39.119 capabilities and bring that to that
01:07:41.119 sector so whether it's AI cross gaming
01:07:43.160 or banking or Pharmaceuticals or
01:07:45.559 whatever right so then you would I I
01:07:47.960 would recommend for younger people to
01:07:50.880 find two to find an area of interest but
01:07:54.319 then also um develop their expertise and
01:07:57.799 knowledge in AI so that they can take
01:07:59.359 those capabilities into that space um
01:08:02.200 and then I think besides that the one
01:08:03.680 other thing that we're seeing is a
01:08:06.079 fundamental shift and so for people who
01:08:07.880 are watching that are interested in
01:08:09.400 gaming I think the big shift that is
01:08:11.599 happening is from a development
01:08:13.760 perspective and it's something that
01:08:15.480 before before you go there if I were to
01:08:17.920 try and incorporate a into my vocabulary
01:08:21.799 as a gamer as a young gamer what tools
01:08:24.439 should I get familiar with what should I
01:08:26.279 learn well I would say like at in the
01:08:29.439 current state I would probably learn all
01:08:32.399 the tools right for example so whether
01:08:35.359 it's chat GPT or Claud 3 or um you know
01:08:40.238 some of the newer tools that are being
01:08:41.640 developed using those uh there's there's
01:08:43.839 a lot of applications in gaming in terms
01:08:45.439 of like conversational Ai and things of
01:08:47.120 that nature so there's a lot of services
01:08:48.679 being developed so becoming familiar
01:08:50.520 with the services and the capabilities
01:08:52.279 that that are being developed but in on
01:08:54.679 top of that to then learn AI in more
01:08:57.198 depth so what is a large language model
01:08:59.640 what what are the kind of models that
01:09:00.960 are out there today whether it's llama
01:09:02.839 or other open source models and things
01:09:04.279 of that nature so what what I would
01:09:07.439 recommend in for AI is act is basically
01:09:10.560 extreme depth learn as much as you can
01:09:13.479 at a foundational fundamental level and
01:09:16.479 then um and then again that that other
01:09:18.880 industry and if you had
01:09:22.120 to name two subsets of a that I should
01:09:26.238 begin focusing on specifically for
01:09:28.520 gaming what would they be well I mean I
01:09:31.238 think the biggest push right now is
01:09:32.920 conversational AI which is meaning you
01:09:35.399 wouldn't say something like Unreal
01:09:36.679 Engine or oh oh well I mean I I think
01:09:40.439 unreal and unity are game development
01:09:42.640 engines right and so I don't think
01:09:45.920 those uh they're they're trying to build
01:09:47.960 some AI capabilities there for example
01:09:50.520 to potentially write code or to automate
01:09:52.600 things but um I don't think AI has as
01:09:55.600 big of an impact on the game engines as
01:09:57.600 they would probably more on a ugc
01:10:00.000 platform so I think you'll you'll start
01:10:01.480 what is ugc uh user generated content
01:10:03.960 and so if you were to look at some of
01:10:06.640 the ugc platforms the user generated
01:10:09.000 content platforms like Roblox or ufn
01:10:11.280 which is epex version of Roblox I can
01:10:15.080 you just explain like think I'm an I'm a
01:10:17.400 lay man proper idiot what is so Roblox
01:10:21.280 is the world's biggest user generated
01:10:23.840 content platform and basically what
01:10:25.640 Roblox is is a platform in which um you
01:10:29.239 know actually many kids go and they
01:10:31.440 build game experiences based upon a set
01:10:34.239 of tools that Roblox provides into the
01:10:36.920 Roblox game world and so you can go to
01:10:39.520 Roblox and there's a bunch of different
01:10:40.880 games that the creators have made so in
01:10:44.120 Roblox creators that are often very
01:10:47.000 young will create these games using the
01:10:49.520 tools that have been provided by
01:10:51.719 Roblox uh and epic now has something
01:10:54.360 similar called U FN Unreal Engine for
01:10:56.800 fortnite um which kind of builds these
01:10:58.880 experiences within fortnite and I don't
01:11:00.920 need any prior knowledge to be able to
01:11:03.080 utilize these you need some depth of
01:11:07.440 understanding so like Roblox for example
01:11:09.679 uses a scripting language called Lua so
01:11:11.880 there is some knowledge required but you
01:11:15.560 know I would say the user generated
01:11:17.440 content platforms are also a way in
01:11:20.320 which someone from India could make
01:11:22.320 potentially millions of dollars right I
01:11:23.840 think like the top creator
01:11:25.880 I I just want to add there because I've
01:11:27.760 been very actively involved in that
01:11:29.320 whole thing right now what he's
01:11:31.120 referring to uh I just did a zoom call
01:11:34.239 recently with a 19-year-old kid who has
01:11:38.080 a game called blocks
01:11:39.480 fruits and it makes some think like $60
01:11:42.679 million a year or something in Revenue
01:11:46.239 after that I've been trying my to
01:11:48.000 migrate my kid from Minecraft or
01:11:50.239 Roblox every day I try that right so
01:11:54.520 it's it's absolutely crazy and he's
01:11:56.280 absolutely right in terms okay tell me
01:11:58.239 that kid 19y old yeah me idiot don't
01:12:02.000 know anything about gaming know little
01:12:04.120 bit about computers can't code nothing
01:12:06.360 okay step one step two step three step
01:12:09.000 four that kid making 60 million yeah
01:12:11.239 name those four steps no I
01:12:13.880 mean coding is one thing right
01:12:16.679 understanding some of these people but
01:12:17.639 these kids are kind of hackers right
01:12:20.080 they've done it handson but I not how do
01:12:22.560 I do it so I would say like first you
01:12:25.239 you need to learn the platform and then
01:12:27.280 learn the kinds of things that the
01:12:29.480 Roblox players are looking for and so
01:12:32.000 the experience on Roblox is different
01:12:33.560 from a mobile game is different from
01:12:35.040 other kinds of games because it's very
01:12:36.520 social in nature and people are in
01:12:39.120 Roblox to not just play but to meet and
01:12:41.679 interact with other players and so step
01:12:44.880 one would be learning robloxs
01:12:47.280 understanding the kinds of games that
01:12:48.360 are popular and forming a hypothesis on
01:12:51.679 why they are popular and this is not
01:12:53.199 complicated I can spend x amount of time
01:12:55.199 13-year-old kids making games on Roblox
01:12:57.639 it's not that complicated and um this
01:13:00.920 the second thing would be to learn the
01:13:02.199 tools Lua and and the Roblox Creator
01:13:05.280 platform and I think the the third thing
01:13:07.800 would just be to just go just build as
01:13:10.080 many games as you can and to then get
01:13:12.360 those repetitions in as far as like
01:13:15.040 building and learning your craft and
01:13:18.040 experimenting to see what works and what
01:13:19.840 doesn't work I mean if I may add um my
01:13:24.000 kids actually trying to make game on
01:13:27.400 Roblox uh so the first you I mean if I
01:13:30.800 may answer to your question you have to
01:13:33.719 love playing games on Roblox or any
01:13:36.800 other platform first so you play Maybe
01:13:39.440 100 different kinds of games first you
01:13:41.639 like it you like this you like you don't
01:13:43.400 like that and then it's a very human
01:13:45.880 nature like if you like certain board
01:13:48.760 game or certain game outside your home
01:13:51.960 you want to change a little bit and make
01:13:54.440 it more fun with your friends that is
01:13:56.600 very uh you know same thing happening in
01:13:59.159 Roblox and Minecraft there are some
01:14:00.760 games that you like then you want to
01:14:03.080 create something similar but in a like
01:14:05.000 your own way that's how actually I think
01:14:07.719 things are starting yeah no it's great
01:14:09.880 and just I wanted to also highlight that
01:14:12.560 the AI he spoke about on ugc right and I
01:14:16.199 was just hearing the podcast of the
01:14:18.320 founder of
01:14:19.520 roblocks and they're talking about now
01:14:21.800 introducing or they've introduced or
01:14:23.400 they're talking about launching soon is
01:14:25.600 Real Time translation so when the kids
01:14:28.760 are talking to each other let's say I'm
01:14:30.520 an Indian and there's another Japanese
01:14:32.360 kid and I'm talking in Hindi to you
01:14:34.760 Japanese kid is going to translate in
01:14:36.800 real time so kids can actually talk in
01:14:39.920 their own language and communicate uh
01:14:43.280 know it translates Hindi into Japanese
01:14:45.800 and it's fantastic so the way AI is
01:14:47.520 being used in such applications to
01:14:50.400 actually bridge and connect I have one
01:14:52.840 confusion here you were not talking
01:14:54.760 about
01:14:56.320 about creating content around the game
01:14:59.199 because you said ugc you're talking
01:15:00.880 about actually building the game yeah I
01:15:03.320 think there's a couple of different
01:15:04.719 opportunities right so there is an
01:15:07.000 opportunity that we haven't talked about
01:15:08.719 which is building games for ugc
01:15:10.719 platforms and name a ugc platform Roblox
01:15:14.360 and ufn those are the two biggest right
01:15:16.360 now when you see ugc my head is going to
01:15:19.520 YouTube user generated content right
01:15:22.000 right it could be anything yeah and I
01:15:24.360 think you know we see plenty of examples
01:15:27.320 of com of Games built by kids that are
01:15:30.400 making tens of millions of dollars like
01:15:32.080 ad do May probably makes like 70 million
01:15:34.120 to to to that team um so that's
01:15:36.920 certainly an opportunity and um and then
01:15:40.000 there's the opportunity that I think is
01:15:41.840 more General outside of ugc platforms
01:15:44.719 which is just by understanding Ai and
01:15:48.400 gaming to then find a specific
01:15:51.199 opportunity to apply AI to gaming and I
01:15:54.639 think certainly what we're going to see
01:15:56.080 is we're going to see a massive shift in
01:15:58.440 how development occurs it's going to
01:16:00.920 change dramatically and radically and as
01:16:03.920 I as I mentioned this kind of depends on
01:16:06.480 your perspective of the world but I
01:16:08.600 actually think that this is going to be
01:16:11.239 an incredibly rare moment in time and
01:16:14.840 probably you know I and I believe
01:16:17.120 unprecedented unprecedented in history
01:16:19.560 where you're going to have the
01:16:21.280 opportunity for some kid in India to
01:16:24.480 become like a billionaire as a single
01:16:27.360 person company right because one of the
01:16:29.080 things that um we're seeing is um this
01:16:32.960 shift from what what I call like long
01:16:36.320 Vector development by Vector I mean time
01:16:39.120 cost resources things like that to Small
01:16:42.440 Vector development and so today you've
01:16:44.840 got a lot of games that have huge
01:16:46.440 budgets 100 200 300 million with huge
01:16:49.760 teams but the promise of AI and it's
01:16:52.800 hard to see right now because it's hard
01:16:54.440 for people to think exponentially but
01:16:57.000 when you see the numbers this is like
01:16:58.719 when Jeff basil started Amazon he saw
01:17:01.120 the dramatic growth in adoption of the
01:17:03.600 internet when you see that kind of what
01:17:06.480 we're currently seeing is we're seeing
01:17:07.960 that growth start to happen and that
01:17:09.560 investment starting to happen but as
01:17:11.360 that happens you're going to be able to
01:17:13.480 then have very small teams build
01:17:16.600 incredible games that have massive reach
01:17:19.159 massive distribution the mobile
01:17:21.280 platforms um iOS and Google play they
01:17:24.600 have billions of people right they
01:17:26.679 billion person
01:17:28.199 platforms um we've also had an example
01:17:30.800 where talking about ugc there was a
01:17:32.800 creator that learned their skills on
01:17:36.159 Roblox but then created a mobile sorry
01:17:39.159 created a PC game called lethal company
01:17:41.400 that became a number one game on Steam
01:17:44.080 so similarly um I I do think that this
01:17:49.159 is a new era and this is the time where
01:17:51.920 I hope that the young Indian people out
01:17:54.679 there they're listening to this podcast
01:17:56.840 will kind of wake up and realize that
01:17:59.800 this moment in time in history is very
01:18:03.159 rare this is the time for them to really
01:18:06.239 like Focus learn and to make something
01:18:11.400 great because I don't think there's
01:18:13.480 going to be that many more opportunities
01:18:14.960 in the world after this after this is
01:18:17.840 done can we all in consultation put out
01:18:22.000 a process dock of recommending ations of
01:18:25.480 what a young person needs to learn yeah
01:18:29.040 yeah they say mid core in core is4
01:18:32.920 billion casual and Hyper casual is7
01:18:36.080 billion can you explain what that means
01:18:39.360 anyone
01:18:41.239 Sean yeah I mean midcore is midcore uh
01:18:45.199 like hardcore games include uh pgmi and
01:18:49.440 maybe other shooter games and some of uh
01:18:51.920 maybe sports games simulation games uh
01:18:54.520 so how do you how do you justify this
01:18:57.239 mid how do you categorize midcore this
01:19:00.159 04 billion midcore games require quite
01:19:05.199 uh like focused attention and a lot of
01:19:07.760 investment uh to make the game yeah yeah
01:19:10.480 generally yes uh uh but there's also
01:19:14.199 like big range but compared to typical
01:19:17.719 hyper casual or hybrid cure games it
01:19:20.280 requires more resources that's for sure
01:19:22.040 you guys want to comment um my only
01:19:24.560 understand the Indian market is that it
01:19:26.280 does seem that it's highly skewed to
01:19:28.719 Shooters it does seem like Shooters are
01:19:30.280 making the majority of the money in
01:19:32.080 India a lot of the they fall in midcore
01:19:34.840 in that bucket midt yeah yeah um and and
01:19:38.360 then it seems like the rest of the money
01:19:40.400 is being made from like Ludo as well as
01:19:43.600 like cricket and things like that and
01:19:46.560 actually it's a surprising number for me
01:19:48.080 that midcore and co- Market is so big
01:19:49.800 because hyper casual is understand so
01:19:51.400 big4 billion 400 million for India 400
01:19:54.280 million for India is still I feel that
01:19:56.639 it's pretty big that you know it's most
01:19:58.920 of it he takes
01:20:01.760 home as what's your market share for
01:20:04.840 bgmi bgmi I would
01:20:09.239 say 5
01:20:11.880 10% he's being he's
01:20:15.120 being I don't
01:20:17.679 know is the money going back to South
01:20:20.239 Korea some of it yes yes we but we
01:20:24.320 invest in India India Tech start invest
01:20:28.040 in companies like Nara he can always
01:20:30.120 invest more right okay so I got an
01:20:33.520 understanding of what is midcore what is
01:20:35.960 casual and Hyper casual which is growing
01:20:37.920 the fastest
01:20:39.199 apparently well I think hyper casual is
01:20:41.679 dying down but it's it's really like the
01:20:43.600 level of complexity is another way to
01:20:45.280 think about it are you think casual and
01:20:47.760 Hyper casual need lesser money yeah uh
01:20:51.560 generally to build because there's
01:20:52.960 simpler games less complexity
01:20:55.520 I would say that um the other kind of
01:20:58.040 nuance behind those games is they
01:20:59.639 typically have lower what's called
01:21:01.679 retention days so like a hyper casual
01:21:03.719 game often might retain a user for like
01:21:06.040 five days or and then um but I think
01:21:09.320 hyper casual is starting to die give me
01:21:11.719 some examples I think Candy Crush and
01:21:13.520 counter- strike hyper casual casual is
01:21:15.480 Candy Crush and then midc core core is
01:21:17.719 well I would say Candy Crush is more
01:21:19.920 casual hyper casual is more like vood
01:21:22.920 like the yeah the voodoo games
01:21:25.760 lot well I would say even lud is more
01:21:28.280 casual rather than hyper casual hyper
01:21:29.920 casual typically has a bunch of for ads
01:21:32.000 and things like that
01:21:34.600 example what's like the old old examples
01:21:37.920 were like snake. iio and all the the
01:21:41.360 phones
01:21:42.880 Blackman Blackman is also
01:21:45.520 still but why is that dying that seems
01:21:47.960 like the simplest thing for people to
01:21:49.800 okay I mean I don't know how deep you
01:21:51.280 want to go because we can go very deep
01:21:53.000 here but uh has to do with mainly apple
01:21:57.480 and basically this thing called idfa um
01:22:01.600 is we're really gonna go into the
01:22:03.600 summary the summary is you can't do
01:22:06.480 targeting anymore because of Apple's
01:22:08.960 privacy policies and so the ability for
01:22:11.719 the hyper casual games that are largely
01:22:13.800 driven off of a ad driven model to then
01:22:16.280 make money off of those ads through
01:22:18.120 targeting is going away and apple just
01:22:22.199 doesn't like hyper casual games well you
01:22:24.560 when I used to play Snake yeah on my old
01:22:27.960 Nokia 3310 phone yeah there was no
01:22:30.760 advertising it came bu with the pH right
01:22:33.920 and it kind of in in Mobile it kind of
01:22:37.480 morphed into a model where you have a
01:22:39.679 super casual gameplay experience but
01:22:42.320 throwing in throwing in a bunch of ads
01:22:44.840 has been the current like you know the
01:22:48.360 the manifestation of of of how hyper
01:22:50.480 casual evolved into so is that ad model
01:22:54.639 moving from ad to inab purchases yes so
01:22:58.120 now it's moving more to what's being
01:22:59.639 called hybrid casual where can you
01:23:01.639 explain uh and hybrid casual is more of
01:23:03.960 a hybrid between more of a casual or
01:23:05.960 midcore game and a hyper casual game
01:23:09.080 with less Reliance on Advertising
01:23:11.159 because of things like the the lack of
01:23:13.679 um of targeting because of privacy and
01:23:15.719 things like that so if I were building a
01:23:17.719 game today let's say I followed the
01:23:20.520 three steps that we would put out from
01:23:22.440 the I would ignore hyper casual I would
01:23:24.800 not look at it at all so say a young guy
01:23:26.840 has done the Nvidia free course the
01:23:28.440 Michigan University free course he's on
01:23:30.960 Roblox he has learned how to create a
01:23:32.719 game now when I start building the
01:23:36.400 game should I plan to monetize my game
01:23:41.120 via inapp purchases versus Pay to-play
01:23:44.639 uh so it depends on the game right so I
01:23:47.520 would say if you're making more of a mid
01:23:49.120 quarter hardcore game it's generally a
01:23:51.159 heavier I apcu and what is I apcu I is
01:23:54.719 just inapp purchase right right so not
01:23:57.000 Advertising based and then the more
01:23:59.040 casual to hyper casual it is the more
01:24:01.199 advertising you would integrate into the
01:24:03.080 game but I think to to the point on like
01:24:06.040 if you were learning Ai and trying to
01:24:08.840 figure out how to apply it you could
01:24:10.520 apply it to making a game you could
01:24:12.800 apply it to figuring out a completely
01:24:14.600 new kind of game to make using AI for
01:24:16.719 example like were they a like Dungeons
01:24:19.239 and Dragons where the AI is suddenly the
01:24:21.440 dungeon master now it can do all the
01:24:23.679 campaigns for right there there's going
01:24:25.280 to be new capabilities and new games
01:24:27.400 that are enabled because of
01:24:29.760 AI and the third area of opportunity
01:24:32.600 would be looking at Ai and trying to
01:24:34.960 pick a specific segment in the game
01:24:37.840 development process that you can help
01:24:40.520 reduce the cost of or automate through
01:24:43.040 AI explain so for example like in game
01:24:47.800 development there's a lot of different
01:24:50.159 teams that do different things right so
01:24:51.960 there's engineering there's art uh
01:24:54.800 there's um product management but if you
01:24:57.280 could use AI to provide a better tool or
01:25:02.159 to automate one of the workflows there
01:25:05.320 like so for example right now coders can
01:25:08.639 use AI tools to help write code for them
01:25:11.760 like co-pilot yes um also AI is being
01:25:15.199 used to generate manuals um product
01:25:17.840 managers can use AI to do data analysis
01:25:20.520 by just dumping in spreadsheets and
01:25:22.800 saying you know visual some stuff for me
01:25:26.199 um and so there's a lot of different
01:25:28.920 things that AI can be applied to and so
01:25:31.600 then it would just be figuring out okay
01:25:33.639 what is a big problem that I can apply
01:25:35.960 AI against right can you give me like a
01:25:39.600 lwh hanging fruit that you think is an
01:25:41.400 opportunity today well I mean I can give
01:25:43.560 you specific examples of what people are
01:25:45.520 doing right now right so the the big
01:25:47.280 thing right now there's two companies uh
01:25:49.199 in world and convey that have been
01:25:51.280 funded for conversational AI meaning
01:25:54.040 right now NPCs in games the non-player
01:25:57.119 characters so like in like an MMO you
01:25:59.560 can go to a shop and then there's a
01:26:00.960 shopkeeper that talks to you well the
01:26:03.880 dialogue that happens often with with
01:26:07.360 whether it's an in story um character or
01:26:10.320 with a shopkeeper that has a very
01:26:12.080 limited amount of dialogue is through
01:26:14.880 like a dialogue tree and so you can use
01:26:17.199 these Behavior trees to like code what
01:26:19.920 is said and not said or you could use a
01:26:22.119 large language model and uh give the
01:26:25.360 background behind a character in the
01:26:27.239 large language model understanding the
01:26:29.400 context of the game and that character
01:26:31.360 that they're supposed to personify can
01:26:33.560 then just naturally respond to people in
01:26:35.880 real time so that's like one application
01:26:38.840 there's other applications where there's
01:26:40.320 there there's a company that's trying to
01:26:41.920 automate the art process right so like
01:26:45.600 um where you uh like think of a think of
01:26:50.440 a character or a building you create the
01:26:53.560 model for it you put it in the game and
01:26:55.840 things like that there are some
01:26:57.080 companies that are just trying to make
01:26:59.040 it so that you do sketches and then it
01:27:01.080 just automatically goes into the game
01:27:03.159 and completes the whole workflow right
01:27:05.480 so there's a lot of different areas that
01:27:08.080 you can potentially apply AI to and
01:27:11.639 again this is why it it's like the cross
01:27:14.080 something so I want to learn product
01:27:16.920 management in gaming super well and then
01:27:19.159 try to figure out areas to attack or I
01:27:21.280 want to learn art super well and figure
01:27:23.800 out is to attack that's the way I would
01:27:26.400 be thinking about it animish after
01:27:28.480 listening to this where do you think the
01:27:30.040 opportunity is for someone young I still
01:27:33.280 feel obviously this is a very big
01:27:35.199 opportunity it's futuristic from all I
01:27:37.400 have read all I seen but I believe that
01:27:40.239 if someone wants to build a start
01:27:41.800 building a game tomorrow and actually go
01:27:44.920 out in the market in the next uh 3 4
01:27:47.679 years uh that data where you mentioned
01:27:50.040 that you know 40% of time is going to
01:27:51.560 social media I think that is very key to
01:27:54.199 India sticking to Mobile gaming and my
01:27:56.639 generation people the younger generation
01:27:58.760 sting uh sticking to mobile phones so I
01:28:01.360 think soci even if I look at my gaming
01:28:03.239 journey and how I got into games uh
01:28:05.400 after a break of break from gaming for
01:28:07.400 good seven eight years I think after
01:28:08.800 class eight I haven't played too much
01:28:10.679 games until I got into college and had
01:28:12.119 some free time and has away from home so
01:28:14.080 it all started with Facebook and then I
01:28:16.639 started playing maybe a Zinga game
01:28:18.159 inside Facebook and then on Facebook I
01:28:20.400 got maybe a recommendation of a
01:28:21.679 supercell game which was Boom Beach and
01:28:24.239 then I went into Boom Beach but the
01:28:26.400 reason why I started playing uh continue
01:28:28.440 to play in Boom Beach was there's a big
01:28:29.719 social element uh attached to that game
01:28:32.080 where I could chat with different people
01:28:33.520 make a clan we could strategize although
01:28:35.679 it was within the game however what
01:28:37.600 happened next is that I took that entire
01:28:39.840 set of audience we exchang our numbers
01:28:41.639 within the game or we went to a Discord
01:28:43.360 server but then we were always socially
01:28:45.440 connected we were chatting we were
01:28:47.520 conversational if I also look at so and
01:28:50.159 that's been the trend in India at least
01:28:51.760 which I can say very confidently that
01:28:53.719 people love playing games which has an
01:28:56.440 element where they can connect connect
01:28:58.520 with existing friends or meet new people
01:29:00.520 so you're saying not so much midcore
01:29:02.560 games but more casual with mobile first
01:29:05.440 casual mobile first and needs to have a
01:29:07.440 social uh social meeting element to it
01:29:10.119 how easy or hard is it to build that uh
01:29:13.320 I think it's difficult not easy to hit
01:29:15.600 the right cords with Indian audience
01:29:17.320 especially and with the culture also
01:29:19.360 it's like you know I believe that there
01:29:20.760 are a lot of nuances that they need to
01:29:22.960 be careful about when you bring the
01:29:24.239 social element of being connected online
01:29:27.040 and it uh I think there's going to be a
01:29:28.760 lot of scrutiny lot of tapings that when
01:29:31.320 they go to build that game so not the
01:29:33.760 taping sorry what is the taping I meant
01:29:36.320 that you know there's going to be a lot
01:29:37.560 of problems when they try to uh have two
01:29:40.159 random people connect online because I
01:29:42.119 believe a lot of games are facing this
01:29:43.400 trouble event today in with respect to
01:29:45.440 bullying happening happening online or
01:29:47.280 cases that we have had because of people
01:29:49.280 not knowing each other but connecting uh
01:29:51.159 within games so I believe that those are
01:29:53.280 the key things that need need to be
01:29:54.320 sorted and because Indian gaming
01:29:55.760 development Market is still evolving so
01:29:57.760 these are a few things that they won't
01:29:58.960 be able to solve when they building in
01:30:00.440 India for India so you're saying young
01:30:02.639 people in India want to solve for both
01:30:05.760 community and and time pass correct that
01:30:09.440 should be the key factor and that is
01:30:11.440 where I believe that Sean can answer why
01:30:13.480 bgmi is so successful like what are
01:30:15.280 those key
01:30:17.119 aspects yeah my understanding I mean
01:30:19.239 people different people might have
01:30:20.760 different opinion I think about uh bjm
01:30:24.280 or like similar games I think it has
01:30:27.440 very good largely speaking there are two
01:30:30.239 elements for the success I believe maybe
01:30:32.840 you guys can add so one thing is social
01:30:35.080 aspects definitely like it is most fun
01:30:38.719 when you are playing with the other
01:30:40.480 Squad members other three members as a
01:30:42.239 team uh which you can keep talking
01:30:45.719 through the voice chat over the like 30
01:30:47.880 minute or 40 minute session uh which
01:30:51.239 give a good reason for playing another
01:30:53.520 session another session maybe tomorrow
01:30:55.360 or next week next weekend which that is
01:30:58.040 a one factor and second factor is
01:31:01.560 unpredictability um it it is mostly like
01:31:04.239 the similar uh elements in many
01:31:07.280 multiplayer games but I think the Battle
01:31:09.600 Royale jungler itself it it has large
01:31:11.920 open not really fully open but large map
01:31:15.040 like uh 8 by8 uh 8 kilm by 8 kilm so
01:31:19.840 there are lot of elements of
01:31:22.239 unpredictability and uh less
01:31:24.679 reputability so every game play feels
01:31:27.600 different uh you cannot really make it
01:31:29.880 if it is a story based game right you if
01:31:31.960 you play 10 hours 20 hours then it's
01:31:34.280 it's finished I've got a slightly
01:31:37.040 different perspective i' love to hear
01:31:38.960 your take on on this Sean I don't I
01:31:40.920 don't know if I've ever talked to you
01:31:42.600 about this before but I believe that
01:31:45.119 games are actually a manifestation of a
01:31:48.560 latent human desire so I think that
01:31:51.440 people generally have in their
01:31:54.560 psychology a need for
01:31:57.400 something and so and I believe that
01:32:00.560 gangs allow people to manifest those
01:32:03.480 Desires in some way which psychological
01:32:06.560 desire though so so let me let me give
01:32:08.480 you a few examples so the the
01:32:11.679 35-year-old soccer mom in the US who's
01:32:15.239 driving her kids to school all day going
01:32:17.960 home washing the dishes doing the
01:32:20.000 laundry but doesn't feel like there's
01:32:21.679 much progress happening in her life
01:32:24.719 but then when she plays Candy Crush Saga
01:32:28.800 she makes progress she can see
01:32:31.440 development she can see all these bright
01:32:33.920 lights in in positive
01:32:36.280 reinforcement um and I also think that
01:32:38.480 for some guys um you know it's like
01:32:41.679 there's a there's a latent human desire
01:32:44.960 for war to show that I'm special yeah
01:32:49.560 and Battle Royale in particular and I
01:32:51.560 agree with you right and I terms of like
01:32:54.280 the variability right and there's uh
01:32:56.199 there's been studies I don't know if you
01:32:57.920 guys are familiar with a Skinner box but
01:33:00.239 what is a skner box a Skinner box um so
01:33:02.960 there was a there there was a research
01:33:04.639 scientist named BF Skinner who did a
01:33:06.920 study on rats that showed like how can I
01:33:09.400 get a rat to press this button more
01:33:12.080 often even though there's an electric
01:33:14.320 shock and then they they they try
01:33:16.320 different kinds of ways to incentivize
01:33:19.000 that R to push the button what they
01:33:20.639 found is that if you provided variable
01:33:23.119 Rewards
01:33:24.639 then the rat will keep pushing that
01:33:25.920 button forever yeah um and so that's why
01:33:28.600 it's lot machines and the way that
01:33:30.480 Battle Royale is structured it's
01:33:33.159 variable and there's two other aspects
01:33:35.480 so one I remember hearing an interview
01:33:37.840 with Ninja who said that the special
01:33:40.360 thing about Battle Royale is that every
01:33:42.360 Battle Royale is like a new story
01:33:44.840 because of that variability aspect but
01:33:47.360 the one other thing I would say is that
01:33:50.760 um on on top of that plus I think that
01:33:53.800 it speaks to Indian culture like I think
01:33:55.480 that Indians have a latent desire to
01:33:58.199 feel special to feel like yes I won
01:34:02.679 Battle Royale I was the best out of 100
01:34:04.800 people why would you is that a cultural
01:34:06.840 thing where Indians feel differently
01:34:08.760 from Americans I think it's simar
01:34:11.480 actually the psychology is the same for
01:34:12.840 Americans right because in America
01:34:14.199 Shooters are number one battle royale is
01:34:16.320 number one in in in the states as well
01:34:18.800 it's not true for Japan Japan RPGs are
01:34:23.280 number one
01:34:24.280 for whatever reason what are RPGs uh
01:34:26.920 role playing games so they really love
01:34:29.000 role playing games more than Shooters
01:34:31.719 but you know in India and the US I think
01:34:33.760 it's a similar
01:34:35.679 psychology Battle Royale and pubg in
01:34:37.960 particular has though is what I call a
01:34:40.840 high climax moment meaning um so there
01:34:45.920 was there's like one definition of Art
01:34:48.360 and the definition of art that I ascribe
01:34:50.800 to is that for me art is something that
01:34:55.199 makes the user feel
01:34:57.440 something so from that
01:35:01.840 perspective that's what battle royale
01:35:03.800 does really well what I believe
01:35:06.719 inherently is all humans are permanently
01:35:10.600 chasing status status in any way I can
01:35:13.920 be really moralistic about something
01:35:16.119 really
01:35:17.119 altruistic I can why for sympathy with
01:35:21.080 everything I can change some kind of
01:35:23.000 status
01:35:24.199 so when we talking about status in
01:35:26.400 gaming do you think it's my skill being
01:35:29.560 better than Sean's for example which is
01:35:31.400 giving me status or is it something more
01:35:34.560 alterior something below that I mean I
01:35:36.600 think status can be gained in many ways
01:35:38.560 so for for the kind of game if it's if
01:35:41.199 it's a shooter game fits like Pub pubg
01:35:44.400 then it will be skill so skill will
01:35:46.840 differentiate you now I mentioned that I
01:35:49.199 used to work at a company called fun
01:35:50.560 plus and we worked on a 4X game uh which
01:35:53.880 is more of a um it's you march you build
01:35:57.040 up armies you work with other people to
01:35:59.000 defeat other people and one of one like
01:36:02.199 Asia of Empires back in the day uh
01:36:04.320 that's more of a PC Forex game I think
01:36:06.159 the most famous Forex game for mobile is
01:36:08.360 called game of war and one of the things
01:36:11.320 that we say in the Forex industry is
01:36:13.520 like what does Forex stand for uh
01:36:17.199 explore ex I don't know I don't even
01:36:19.800 remember
01:36:22.159 anymore extermin something anyway
01:36:24.920 there's forex's but um one of the things
01:36:27.880 that we used talk about is like you know
01:36:31.119 what would somebody pay to become
01:36:34.159 famous like if you could be known by
01:36:36.679 30,000 people how valuable would that be
01:36:39.119 to you what would you pay for that well
01:36:41.280 guess what in Forex games people do pay
01:36:43.440 it so that they can be famous famous in
01:36:47.000 the Social Circle inside yeah so you
01:36:49.400 might be you know you might be lockar 59
01:36:52.639 but and no body in the real world knows
01:36:54.719 who you are but in a specific game they
01:36:57.159 might be like oh my God that's lockar 59
01:36:59.960 you know what I'm saying so what you're
01:37:01.440 saying is like everything else in the
01:37:03.840 world people inside games that are
01:37:06.639 working are chasing
01:37:08.320 status that could be one thing they
01:37:10.560 could be chasing emotion they could be
01:37:12.239 chasing status they could be chasing a
01:37:14.119 feeling of progress and I think the
01:37:16.639 different types of games help people
01:37:20.280 cope with their latent human desires for
01:37:23.159 something
01:37:24.679 and is it very hard because of the
01:37:26.639 opportunity cost if I have spent x
01:37:30.679 amount of time on a particular game
01:37:33.440 derived y amount of
01:37:35.440 status is there a big moot because of
01:37:38.000 that I will not switch from that game to
01:37:39.840 another because I'll have to rebuild
01:37:41.119 status is there a way to transition
01:37:43.639 status from one game to another not as
01:37:46.320 as far as I know not right now I mean
01:37:48.440 that was the I'm not sure how familiar
01:37:51.080 you are with crypto games but that was
01:37:53.080 like what one of the things they were
01:37:54.360 trying to do is to help transfer assets
01:37:56.560 between games but that never really
01:37:57.920 worked out
01:37:59.679 yet as a gamer it did work out for me I
01:38:02.800 mean like if I look at I had a very good
01:38:05.880 following and people knew me 8 bit Thug
01:38:07.960 In Clash Royale and it really helped me
01:38:09.560 transition as a gamer purely as a gamer
01:38:11.800 transition well into pubg Mobile in
01:38:14.159 India and people still knew me and
01:38:15.840 people would still want to join itbit
01:38:17.880 because they knew me from that and I had
01:38:19.320 a set but are you talking about your
01:38:20.920 status in game or out of the game in
01:38:22.960 game purely in game because that time it
01:38:24.880 was all my friends within the game where
01:38:27.000 people I have never met so I believe
01:38:29.480 that it really helps but that's a gamer
01:38:31.320 perspective it could be a unique case as
01:38:33.480 well but it helped so while I was
01:38:35.960 researching today for
01:38:38.400 today the one thing that seemed to
01:38:40.800 permeate every domain is games saw this
01:38:44.880 crazy spike in covid but right now the
01:38:48.239 industry is completely screwed people
01:38:50.800 are getting fired in most large compan
01:38:53.440 companies from Microsoft to
01:38:55.480 Sony games are getting
01:38:58.719 dropped and it seems like a fairly
01:39:02.480 tumultuous time for the industry today
01:39:05.719 how how far is that
01:39:08.040 true I I actually don't think it's true
01:39:11.199 I don't know if you want to well so like
01:39:13.199 yes because of Co there was a huge Spike
01:39:15.639 but if you look at the overall
01:39:17.239 trajectory at least on the mobile side
01:39:20.880 the the growth like if you smooth out Co
01:39:24.440 then there was an overinvestment because
01:39:26.679 of Co and everyone was extrapolating
01:39:29.159 linearly and a lot of additional people
01:39:31.599 were hired and things things like that
01:39:33.679 and now we're kind of correcting on the
01:39:35.440 downside but I mean that's a typical
01:39:37.800 business cycle right that that is
01:39:39.560 happening every industry right I know
01:39:42.440 nitish can't say anything about this cuz
01:39:44.080 he's publicly listed company no no say
01:39:48.080 actually hon actually answer this
01:39:50.239 question every quarter so yeah but
01:39:53.480 happened with India as well but tell me
01:39:55.280 this the money as a gamer that you made
01:39:58.400 2 years ago has it gone down today of
01:40:00.920 course it has that's what I'm saying but
01:40:02.280 it's a correction it's best for the
01:40:03.719 industry if this correction wouldn't
01:40:04.880 have happened today so a year earlier
01:40:07.599 around 2020 everyone was saying there is
01:40:08.920 a bubble de ready to bust in India first
01:40:11.400 but luckily it was not a bubble bust it
01:40:13.199 was just a slight correction after the
01:40:14.880 all the global crisis that hit in and
01:40:17.000 it's a correction and correction for the
01:40:18.360 good because now if I look at my side of
01:40:20.719 the industry Esports team owners or
01:40:23.560 people entering the industry with the
01:40:25.199 mindset of making quick money you cannot
01:40:27.080 make quick money anymore when so if you
01:40:29.599 look at my company when people were over
01:40:32.280 investing into their business when their
01:40:34.480 pnls were in red deep red uh I was
01:40:39.280 spending the least and today when the
01:40:41.199 econom uh the market is bad you know bad
01:40:43.520 in the bad shape where there's not
01:40:44.560 enough money flowing in there's no
01:40:45.760 streaming platform money there is no
01:40:47.679 direct money from the brands everyone
01:40:49.159 has tightened their grip I'm spending
01:40:51.159 the most and I've been able to suain and
01:40:53.639 grow so I'm growing at a point so I
01:40:55.560 think it all comes from the
01:40:56.760 understanding of how people
01:40:58.760 perceived about perceived about Indian
01:41:01.080 gaming when they entered the market what
01:41:03.520 did they want to make quick Buck because
01:41:05.400 of the co ride or they wanted to build
01:41:07.320 something for the next 10 15 20 years
01:41:09.480 like if they had some inspiration taken
01:41:11.360 from somewhere in from a team in America
01:41:13.520 or a team in Europe if a gamer entered
01:41:15.400 the YouTube space to build something for
01:41:17.480 the next 15 years or someone was looking
01:41:19.000 for an overnight success because uh
01:41:21.000 there were a lot of users plogging into
01:41:22.440 YouTube to watch gamees
01:41:23.800 so I think debt changed everything and
01:41:25.400 the correction is for the best one thing
01:41:27.440 I didn't ask you is your personal
01:41:29.480 Journey where do you make the most money
01:41:31.800 from is it your content is it the people
01:41:35.719 you manage uh I make the most money from
01:41:38.000 people I manage the talent management
01:41:39.599 business okay when I look at
01:41:41.560 establishing Market size in India the
01:41:44.159 numbers state that Gamers were 400
01:41:48.480 million in 21 in 23 they are 560 million
01:41:52.800 going up up every year this doesn't
01:41:55.159 sound reasonable to me like India is a
01:41:58.440 country where 2% of our population pay
01:42:01.719 tax right like 25 30 million people tops
01:42:06.520 how are there 560 million gamers in
01:42:09.400 India I think this is RMG and skill
01:42:11.760 based combined and I'm not sure because
01:42:14.159 they would have more data butg real
01:42:15.960 money gaming yeah I think it's combined
01:42:18.280 this data because we are talking about
01:42:19.920 55 CR Gamers I guess 568 million
01:42:22.520 impossible
01:42:24.480 but but I think everybody's a gamer
01:42:27.159 right and I one of the things that we
01:42:29.760 haven't talked about is how because of
01:42:32.280 some of the stuff that happened between
01:42:33.679 the US and China going back to that
01:42:35.280 topic a lot of production is Shifting to
01:42:37.800 India right there's going to be a Tesla
01:42:39.480 Factory in India there's all sorts of
01:42:41.159 stuff moving to India which should then
01:42:43.560 enable a bigger middle class in India
01:42:46.480 which should then enable higher
01:42:48.199 disposable income which should then
01:42:51.080 enable a lot of people in India to who
01:42:54.760 who maybe don't even identify as Gamers
01:42:57.560 to then spend in games because they
01:42:59.599 actually are Gamers so what do you think
01:43:02.360 okay remove real money giving how many
01:43:05.000 people in
01:43:06.199 India are playing games on a
01:43:09.400 PlayStation or a computer versus how
01:43:12.639 many people are playing on a mobile
01:43:14.159 phone and how many people are doing real
01:43:16.679 money gaming if you had to break that
01:43:18.239 down it's on mobile right I run on
01:43:20.920 mobile7
01:43:24.080 would be 95% what mobile yeah yeah
01:43:26.840 mobile games and bgmi being the largest
01:43:30.159 mobile games could be could be but there
01:43:32.520 could be a casual game like L taking
01:43:34.320 space from a re perspective yes but I
01:43:37.199 think the highest grossing app uh wait
01:43:40.400 97% of What Not 550 million 95% 97 5% of
01:43:46.599 the whole game gamer gaming population
01:43:49.000 Sean can tell us you'll know the number
01:43:50.400 since he's a market leader how many
01:43:52.119 people are playing bgm in India I
01:43:55.360 believe uh like people who are actually
01:43:58.560 regularly playing uh one specific one or
01:44:00.880 two specific games and at least willing
01:44:03.560 to pay maybe they haven't paid uh at all
01:44:06.800 or they might pay once in a like maybe
01:44:09.960 three five six months which has capacity
01:44:13.040 to pay or willingness to pay altogether
01:44:15.000 might be I believe 100 million or 80
01:44:17.400 million is that's a lot that's that's
01:44:19.840 still a lot uh great number maybe the
01:44:24.000 the the average payment average uh
01:44:26.760 paying amount might be much lesser than
01:44:28.880 global average but at least they are
01:44:31.119 willing to pay for gaming I mean that's
01:44:33.679 the way I look at the space is for
01:44:35.960 content content yeah uh Netflix maybe 6
01:44:39.679 s million people are willing to pay the
01:44:42.159 $10 it Peaks at geoc Cinemas hot star
01:44:46.520 combination maybe 50 million people are
01:44:48.920 willing to pay $10 a year for crazy
01:44:53.440 amount of content M so if that is 50
01:44:56.119 million but 100 million are willing to
01:44:58.159 play to pay to play is a lot and you're
01:45:01.760 talking more inapp purchases right in
01:45:03.400 purchase yes not payto
01:45:05.000 play yeah I I mean there is no very like
01:45:10.440 good statistics from One Source it's
01:45:13.360 more of guestimation but that's my
01:45:16.560 guesstimation and real money gaming do
01:45:18.880 you agree with that number yeah I think
01:45:20.920 so I think the important point to also
01:45:23.159 understand is there's a perception that
01:45:24.480 games in India are played by kids or
01:45:26.599 youngsters but I think that's not true
01:45:28.760 at all it's now and especially after
01:45:31.280 covid right it's cutting across
01:45:34.119 demographics ages I gend youngsters are
01:45:37.560 spending 12 hours a day 12 hours a week
01:45:39.800 on gaming but I'm guessing adults can't
01:45:42.360 be spending that much no they are and
01:45:44.040 different use cases for different people
01:45:45.880 you know my own grandom just touched 90
01:45:49.599 and she plays games on her phone and she
01:45:51.840 likes to play word games for a variety
01:45:53.719 of entertainment right when we were
01:45:55.719 going IPO one of the things on my mind
01:45:57.880 was responsible gaming we have a game
01:46:00.199 called world cricket championship which
01:46:01.560 is a popular cricket
01:46:03.040 game don't virtue signal because you're
01:46:05.239 a listate company and talk word
01:46:06.679 responsible gaming you wish your clients
01:46:09.159 were playing 24 hours a day no no but
01:46:11.000 still still still had to look at it
01:46:14.880 you're selling a game at the end of the
01:46:16.320 day no no but still another stat I
01:46:18.280 wanted to ask is I read that in the
01:46:21.320 gaming split while we were were
01:46:23.080 establishing Market size first thing uh
01:46:26.599 Sean said 100 million let's go with that
01:46:28.760 number I'm assuming of the balance
01:46:32.119 450 a lot of it is real money
01:46:35.520 gaming no because 100 million he said
01:46:38.440 what potential payers there are a lot of
01:46:40.920 casual gamers right yeah a lot of people
01:46:44.199 and all again as I said across
01:46:47.320 demographics uh playing for time pass
01:46:50.400 playing for two kill time what games
01:46:52.920 Bing games yeah exactly and they don't
01:46:55.320 pay so they happy to see some ads and
01:46:58.199 continue playing and how big is dream L
01:47:00.920 what is their number of users count I
01:47:03.880 think it's over 200 million yeah that
01:47:06.280 kind of starting to add up right 200
01:47:08.040 from there 100 from
01:47:10.480 here the balance 115 casual and people
01:47:15.719 say that the split is 60 men 40 women is
01:47:18.360 that right I'll talk about my industry
01:47:20.639 in finance the split is more like 83 men
01:47:24.199 and 17 women participants is it really
01:47:28.239 6040 I think it's 75 25ish is from what
01:47:32.119 I read latest so maybe uh like meat
01:47:35.400 corish games which is more like um which
01:47:39.080 needs more time spent and more Focus
01:47:41.599 that would
01:47:42.679 75 uh like male and 25 female I think
01:47:46.239 casual games it can become like more
01:47:48.199 balanced yeah do you guys have a opinion
01:47:50.679 on Real Money gaming uh I'm sure you
01:47:53.520 heard about the
01:47:55.840 taxation in
01:47:57.560 India uh I'll go through each one of you
01:47:59.880 because it's such a big monster in the
01:48:01.880 room that we have to talk about it right
01:48:04.679 like while I see this hush is a really
01:48:06.159 good friend of mine the dream 11 guy I
01:48:07.840 think he's nitish's friend as well but
01:48:12.119 how do you think it affects dream L and
01:48:15.360 all of his competitors this tax do you
01:48:18.119 think it's fair that they did what they
01:48:20.320 did let's start with uh
01:48:23.760 animish I don't think it's fair I think
01:48:25.679 it was too harsh but then it was too
01:48:28.040 harsh too harsh too harsh to harsh yeah
01:48:31.280 but I felt that it was more harsh on the
01:48:33.480 profitability from my Layman
01:48:35.480 understanding because uh I saw that
01:48:37.760 dream 11 did put out a coupon code in a
01:48:40.679 way you know it did not affect the end
01:48:42.320 user at the end so I think smart plays
01:48:44.560 always come into play and but yeah I
01:48:47.119 guess it did take a hit I had good
01:48:48.800 friends in MPL and wio who are really
01:48:51.159 affected I met the wiso cound us a
01:48:53.320 couple of times and they have been our
01:48:55.400 very good clients so has been MPL people
01:48:57.719 were really hit hard so I actually pity
01:48:59.599 for the industry because that was like a
01:49:01.320 one night thing it just suddenly changed
01:49:03.000 everything for them so take but yeah I
01:49:06.560 think the government has a big team
01:49:08.000 working on them so they always take the
01:49:10.360 best decision I'm all for free market
01:49:12.920 capitalism I feel like if somebody is
01:49:17.119 willing to engage with a certain
01:49:19.360 platform consciously somebody
01:49:23.239 able willing adult spending his own
01:49:26.360 money I feel
01:49:27.840 like regulations cues Industries in in
01:49:31.560 manners which is not always conducive to
01:49:34.239 Innovation and evolution of whatever
01:49:36.639 industry I feel like there should be
01:49:38.400 less control and not more nitish this is
01:49:41.159 a more uh nuanced question for you
01:49:44.480 because I know nazara doesn't really do
01:49:47.080 RMG but you have a tiny component which
01:49:49.679 is like 1% or 2% two 2% yeah what do you
01:49:54.280 think look I think over the last few
01:49:56.520 years it's clearly been demonstrated
01:49:59.000 that the consumer demand is there
01:50:01.679 consumer interest in participating and
01:50:04.800 playing real money games is definitely
01:50:07.880 very high in India it's not new right uh
01:50:10.440 people participating and betting in
01:50:12.000 cricket has forever been there whether
01:50:15.440 it's not even allowed it's bad but would
01:50:17.719 you argue that it formalized what was
01:50:19.920 otherwise a black market where we as
01:50:22.679 Ians were not benefiting from the tax
01:50:24.599 revenue yeah absolutely what do you
01:50:27.320 think about it personally if I were to
01:50:29.400 ask you
01:50:31.280 about fantasy fantasy Cricket Ramy poker
01:50:37.360 a whole bunch of games like that yeah
01:50:39.679 which game requires the most skill to
01:50:41.679 least skill in that order I think uh so
01:50:46.360 it's not necessarily the game but how it
01:50:48.239 is played and who is playing it whether
01:50:50.320 it is for skill or Not Right But My
01:50:53.119 overall thesis here is that there is
01:50:55.920 consumer
01:50:57.320 demand people are going to play when you
01:51:00.119 ban you've seen in many states for
01:51:01.880 example in India where games have been
01:51:04.560 banned the online real money games have
01:51:07.040 been banned MH the businesses usually
01:51:09.280 gone
01:51:10.679 underground to more irresponsible
01:51:13.000 players right which completely exposes
01:51:15.560 the users right so I think the right
01:51:18.079 balance with the right amount of
01:51:22.679 regulation and framework mhm for
01:51:25.239 companies to responsibly do it as well
01:51:27.880 as the government to get its fair share
01:51:29.679 of tax is probably a healthier healthier
01:51:33.360 place to be versus a completely
01:51:35.880 unregulated Market uh which is going
01:51:38.639 underground and uh getting uh you know
01:51:41.040 screwed up now in terms of what is the
01:51:42.840 tax what is the fair amount of tax I
01:51:45.320 think there's no perfect answer
01:51:46.920 obviously if currently what was the
01:51:49.079 number 30% no no so 28 it's 28 % now the
01:51:53.719 latest tax on the GST is 28% on
01:51:57.599 deposits uh which was earlier 20 I mean
01:52:00.920 gaming companies were paying 18% on uh
01:52:03.599 their rake right now the Spectrum can be
01:52:06.960 very large it could be 18% on rake it
01:52:09.320 could be all the way 28% on entry fee is
01:52:11.840 the tax now on rake or the money it's on
01:52:14.280 the money you deposits if you put in 100
01:52:16.320 rupees in your online you think that is
01:52:18.159 the part people are contesting that it
01:52:19.679 should be on the rake and not the money
01:52:21.239 put in
01:52:23.000 yeah I mean the industry is of course I
01:52:25.360 mean they would want the least amount of
01:52:27.639 tax right so that is the main contention
01:52:29.440 it is okay to charge the revenue of the
01:52:33.239 company but like in e-commerce terms not
01:52:36.079 the gmbb yeah so that's where it is
01:52:39.639 right now but I think over the next few
01:52:41.560 months hopefully there will be more
01:52:42.760 clarity on how this uh pans out
01:52:48.770 [Music]
01:52:56.320 [Music]
01:53:02.510 [Applause]
01:53:04.050 [Music]
01:53:05.960 I want each of you guys to come up with
01:53:07.520 one thing what is it that will be
01:53:10.000 relevant 5 years from now vure a guess
01:53:13.079 you want to go first I think that person
01:53:15.400 needs to realize that attention span has
01:53:17.159 already declined it's going to decline
01:53:19.000 further so whatever they are making it
01:53:21.599 needs to move a very fast speed for the
01:53:24.040 user so you both are in contradiction
01:53:27.280 there because Joseph thinks casual and
01:53:30.000 super casual which might require lesser
01:53:32.159 attention span is declining well hyper
01:53:35.719 casual is declining I would say casual
01:53:37.719 is not necessarily declining but hyper
01:53:40.639 casual in terms of these very casual
01:53:42.199 games with a bunch of ads for reasons in
01:53:44.639 my mind I think sneake hyp right think
01:53:48.320 snake but you're they load a bunch of
01:53:50.320 ads on top of it right yeah so that's
01:53:52.520 stuff is starting to go away so what do
01:53:54.520 what do you mean by uh your
01:53:59.960 time focused on the game going down how
01:54:02.480 much time I think it's not about the
01:54:04.760 time it's about the next event that's
01:54:06.440 going to happen when I'm playing the
01:54:07.639 game so I think if if I for example if
01:54:10.480 I'm meeting an NPC a non-playing
01:54:12.239 character uh in the game and it
01:54:14.639 progresses my story line earlier when I
01:54:16.520 have played games like Batman Etc we
01:54:18.560 used to have long chats long dialogues
01:54:20.560 that they would used to tell a story
01:54:21.719 used to be really beautiful I don't
01:54:23.480 think people are going to be ready for
01:54:25.119 that in the next 5 years the first event
01:54:27.239 the next event needs the the rate at
01:54:29.199 which events happen in the game or
01:54:30.480 events occur in the game naturally
01:54:31.719 faster because I think swipe up
01:54:33.560 generation is going to take up the world
01:54:35.320 and it's just going to be swipe swipe
01:54:36.840 swipe so we need to have events that
01:54:38.480 happen faster attention span games that
01:54:40.280 are fastpaced very fastpaced I think
01:54:42.440 that's the reason maybe Battle Royale or
01:54:44.040 FPS games would live longer because it
01:54:46.800 it always involves action like you know
01:54:48.679 even if they even if you're standing at
01:54:50.000 a position you're still you're still are
01:54:53.119 doing something which will have the next
01:54:55.360 event occur but when you're playing
01:54:56.679 story mode games or normal casual games
01:54:59.119 you cannot just be moving slowly and
01:55:00.880 wait for something to happen give me an
01:55:02.599 example of the kind of game which will
01:55:04.360 work in 5 years and one which
01:55:06.520 won't I think uh there's a game called
01:55:10.280 Among Us it should still work in 5 years
01:55:13.320 any and that works in five years because
01:55:15.480 something is happening something is
01:55:16.679 happening really fast I believe that we
01:55:19.000 cannot have those slow story mode games
01:55:21.360 that we used to play same thing we
01:55:23.000 established why watching movies and
01:55:25.679 sport is not working anymore because
01:55:28.119 you're not interacting with the
01:55:30.440 interface in a manner you're watching
01:55:31.719 and it takes a long period of time long
01:55:33.079 period also I think it could be a major
01:55:34.760 reason why Tik Tok and reals and shots
01:55:37.560 are doing really well I mean like last
01:55:39.880 night I was actually scrolling your
01:55:41.400 podcast shots and it itally took me into
01:55:45.000 a loop of two and a half hours where I
01:55:46.639 just got related content I got so
01:55:48.480 intrigued then I was looking at your
01:55:50.280 guest speaking at some other places that
01:55:52.520 D out into R's other interviews so it's
01:55:54.840 just a loop and I just saw the CL it's
01:55:57.360 300 a.m. and I was like good three good
01:55:59.800 2 and a half hours but that is what it
01:56:02.079 is about but I won't watch a 2 and a
01:56:04.040 half hours of movie uh of a content of a
01:56:07.239 related topic and one example of a game
01:56:10.000 which won't work in 5 years
01:56:13.800 uh a very beautiful game that I used to
01:56:18.079 play not able to recollect its
01:56:20.760 name but something like I would say a
01:56:23.320 Batman Arkham Knight wouldn't work it's
01:56:24.960 one of our very fantastic games I think
01:56:26.440 it's slow pace because you know you have
01:56:28.719 those dialogues coming in then you yeah
01:56:31.199 you have to go from one place to another
01:56:33.560 the movements are difficult I think even
01:56:35.400 if you talk about the way the movements
01:56:37.000 happen in game people would want more
01:56:38.960 simplified versions of it like you know
01:56:40.800 just give us two buttons two joysticks
01:56:43.040 allow us to move like even me iol like I
01:56:46.040 have playing less games nowadays because
01:56:47.480 I have other work to do but when now I
01:56:49.639 want to play new games I like tend to
01:56:51.040 play simpler games not have too many uh
01:56:54.159 abilities too many buttons that I need
01:56:55.880 to use so maybe I think there could be a
01:56:58.000 trans I believe that there a lot of
01:56:59.320 people like me who are transitioning
01:57:00.800 into such type of games these are a few
01:57:02.560 things that might change 5 years later
01:57:04.599 and nitish one Insight 5 years from now
01:57:07.320 that people should bear in mind looking
01:57:08.880 to build a career here I think gaming is
01:57:11.840 on the cusp of many new technologies and
01:57:14.280 therefore the experience of gaming
01:57:15.760 itself is
01:57:17.000 changing we already spoke a lot about AI
01:57:19.480 so I won't repeat that but also for
01:57:22.280 example I'm personally of the opinion
01:57:25.040 that uh virtual reality will become far
01:57:28.679 more tangible in the years to come right
01:57:31.239 and I've been playing with the Apple
01:57:32.760 Vision Pro and the quest Pro and I think
01:57:34.920 now the experience we've been looking at
01:57:36.400 for a decade I think it's the company
01:57:38.400 we've been looking at VR for a decade it
01:57:40.920 was never there I think the experience
01:57:43.040 has got there and I think once it
01:57:44.320 transcends a little bit more maybe two
01:57:46.639 three years down now you have three big
01:57:48.480 players Sony meta and now Apple in that
01:57:51.679 freay
01:57:52.880 I think you will go from potentially
01:57:55.480 playing a game to being in the game
01:57:58.560 which can be transformative I know that
01:58:00.280 a lot of people are still very
01:58:01.360 pessimistic because I think they burned
01:58:02.880 for very long on VR and stuff like that
01:58:06.639 but at least I believe that's the future
01:58:08.199 of gaming how does
01:58:10.480 somebody build the proficiency required
01:58:14.719 to cater to games on VR and AR I mean
01:58:18.079 it's the same tools that you're using
01:58:19.480 largely
01:58:23.000 building a game for
01:58:24.639 VR you can use some of the
01:58:27.159 same engines are
01:58:30.360 similar
01:58:33.960 Sean I mean nitish mentioned about AR uh
01:58:37.840 I mean VR so I would uh I feel that AR
01:58:41.920 might be closer than VR I mean I also
01:58:46.159 bought like different version of uh meta
01:58:48.880 quest uh which I use maybe for two three
01:58:54.679 hours uh maybe one week or two weeks and
01:58:58.280 then I I gave up why because uh like it
01:59:04.719 doesn't feel very comfortable to play
01:59:06.520 long hours and that uncomfortableness
01:59:10.440 doesn't uh sort of uh allow me to
01:59:15.199 re-engage but I think AR for example
01:59:18.119 like Pokemon go which
01:59:20.599 blend uh the reality I mean the realist
01:59:24.760 the physical space with your smartphone
01:59:27.400 actually give a lot of different
01:59:29.119 experience which traditional game didn't
01:59:31.960 offer I think that can be actually
01:59:35.480 invented in a lot different ways if you
01:59:38.840 uh if as a game designer or game
01:59:40.400 producer if you can you know really
01:59:42.719 become Innovative and experimental so
01:59:45.000 that that is my sort of yeah what is the
01:59:48.840 role of Discord and Twitch in in the
01:59:52.239 gaming
01:59:54.440 world you go yeah so Discord is was more
01:59:58.760 of the chat room that we used to exist
02:00:00.840 when games did not have uh viip like you
02:00:03.440 know you could not talk in within the
02:00:05.280 game there used to be teams speak a
02:00:07.119 software called teams speake then
02:00:08.280 Discord took over however Discord also
02:00:10.760 brought with itself the community
02:00:13.000 building angle in the form of a server
02:00:15.159 it's called a Discord server so what you
02:00:17.360 could do is you could get your friends
02:00:19.560 or people only whom you want to join and
02:00:22.239 a particular server and do a closed chat
02:00:24.920 and a closed call outside the game so I
02:00:27.719 think Discord really changed everything
02:00:30.000 for gaming a in a lot of ways but now
02:00:32.239 Discord has gone into a lot of things
02:00:33.880 like it's for relevant to a lot of
02:00:36.040 Industries relevant to a lot of
02:00:37.639 industries that are non-gaming that are
02:00:39.639 into it's a big space for web3 also I
02:00:42.040 think a lot of web3 games are being
02:00:43.960 discussed and the communities are being
02:00:45.199 formed within Discord it's great for art
02:00:47.960 as well even like I have joined some
02:00:49.280 servers which used to have artists in it
02:00:50.760 who used to help me out so it's a
02:00:52.079 community building it's a social media
02:00:53.360 platform I would say is it a good way
02:00:55.440 somebody said Discord is democratizing
02:00:58.639 game marketing I don't think Discord has
02:01:01.079 too much of a role to play in that but I
02:01:03.119 would let them take this question like
02:01:04.800 if a game is really good people will
02:01:07.239 chat with each other in The Gaming
02:01:08.880 Community in Discord Discover it so
02:01:11.280 traditional marketing for games might be
02:01:14.480 getting disrupted I mean I I would
02:01:16.320 actually think that it's more rather
02:01:18.360 than Discord it's more twitch and
02:01:19.920 YouTube that are allowing influencers to
02:01:23.119 become the new marketing for games right
02:01:25.400 and so today and you know you mentioned
02:01:27.639 among us but like some of those games
02:01:30.079 were going nowhere for like I think
02:01:32.119 Among Us had like nothing for like three
02:01:34.480 or four years and then some influencers
02:01:36.800 picked it up and talked about it and
02:01:38.599 then it blew up so I would agree where
02:01:42.960 Discord is more of like the community
02:01:45.360 tool the ways that that you can have a
02:01:47.960 one-on-one conversation with your player
02:01:50.800 with your players and your audience
02:01:52.440 to get that direct feedback so I view it
02:01:54.960 more as a feedback and Community
02:01:56.320 Building mechanism we think in similar
02:01:58.760 ways on that but I think that in terms
02:02:01.320 of marketing that would be more twitch
02:02:03.079 and YouTube and certainly that has been
02:02:06.000 a big shift is that influencers now are
02:02:09.400 really driving many installs and driving
02:02:11.840 a lot of the the word of mouth and
02:02:13.880 awareness for games today if I had a
02:02:16.360 game I did all that we
02:02:19.400 discussed I did nvidia's pre Cod yeah I
02:02:23.159 did the University of Michigan free
02:02:25.400 course I learned whatever Roblox is and
02:02:28.960 then I
02:02:31.199 built not a hyper casual but a casual
02:02:35.000 game which is mobile first CU most
02:02:37.920 people in India are playing on mobile he
02:02:39.880 said
02:02:42.239 97% do I
02:02:44.400 then
02:02:46.400 integrate
02:02:47.920 influencers Discord and twitch to sell
02:02:50.440 the game and get the word out is there a
02:02:52.760 particular way to do that how does a
02:02:54.880 game Garner
02:02:57.639 virality see that's a very typical way
02:03:00.360 of doing it like you're launching a
02:03:01.840 product in the market and you have
02:03:03.199 influencers talking about
02:03:05.320 it the other way of how me as a game
02:03:09.280 mode want things to happen is involve
02:03:12.159 those influencers all those key
02:03:13.760 stakeholders all those Gamers that you
02:03:16.199 actually want to Target obviously it
02:03:17.920 cannot be the entire cord but at your
02:03:20.480 alpha or pre beta St age or even before
02:03:22.639 Alpha mhm so this is one thing that
02:03:24.639 indust did the super gaming that I'm
02:03:26.400 talking about indust invited us a year
02:03:29.000 and a half back to you know just show us
02:03:30.440 the game and just take casual feedback
02:03:33.079 of how it's doing what do you think
02:03:34.679 about it I think those are some key
02:03:36.719 things that are very important and it
02:03:38.880 really helped strike a cord between so
02:03:40.719 it was me and Mortal who went there that
02:03:42.880 you know if they invited us at such a
02:03:45.040 stage to take feedback that means it's a
02:03:47.400 sort of a moral responsibility towards
02:03:49.000 us that when this game comes out we'll
02:03:50.679 talk about it and we actually went ahead
02:03:52.119 and talked about it even today we talk
02:03:53.440 about it like that's the reason I'm
02:03:54.480 talking about it because I felt really
02:03:55.719 connected to it so I believe that
02:03:58.040 generally the development story also
02:03:59.880 helps that was the case with what how
02:04:01.840 Riot does it you know they will call the
02:04:03.559 game Project X then they'll talk about
02:04:05.679 it for two years then they will release
02:04:07.559 teasers then there will be leaks that
02:04:09.679 will come out and then they will release
02:04:11.559 a game with Alpha Beta prea and an
02:04:14.159 official launch so I think a good way to
02:04:16.520 go about is talk about it start very
02:04:18.800 early if you are if your product is
02:04:20.760 ready and then you want to Launch it's
02:04:22.079 always very expensive I mean like you
02:04:24.199 know the marketing starts very
02:04:26.480 early so this is external marketing you
02:04:29.040 can also build Vitality into your game
02:04:32.159 so one is if you can play the game with
02:04:33.760 your
02:04:34.599 friends right for example in India Ludo
02:04:37.679 blw up because when I was playing Ludo I
02:04:40.960 wanted to play it with my friends and I
02:04:42.559 would automatically through the game
02:04:43.920 easily be able to invite my friends or
02:04:46.800 family to play with me right many games
02:04:49.920 incorporate stuff like you can can
02:04:51.800 unlock special features if you refer
02:04:54.040 this game to five friends there a lot of
02:04:56.880 hacks that you can build into your game
02:04:58.880 also to drive organic verality from
02:05:01.880 within your
02:05:03.159 game if I know nothing about the gaming
02:05:06.040 world and I want to go talk to people
02:05:08.679 who are in the gaming world where is the
02:05:11.119 easiest place to connect with
02:05:13.079 them I'm starting from scratch in India
02:05:16.400 probably igdc the game conference the
02:05:19.679 biggest conference when does it happen
02:05:22.119 who organizes it November uh Hyderabad
02:05:25.880 in
02:05:26.920 Hyderabad who puts it on sorry who
02:05:30.000 organizes it um it's a volunteer
02:05:33.320 organization there's a committee or
02:05:35.000 council members uh who has been in the
02:05:37.400 industry for a long time I think but the
02:05:41.599 IND Indian typical mind would work
02:05:43.480 differently like if I want to know about
02:05:45.119 something I would search who the most
02:05:46.440 famous person is and try to figure out
02:05:48.719 that where that person is doing a
02:05:49.960 dialogue and then re that I think
02:05:51.719 majority of the Indians would first come
02:05:53.159 to a gamer who is streaming on YouTube
02:05:55.239 or twitch go to his chat speak and then
02:05:58.559 start igdc believe me no 19yearold boy
02:06:02.119 who knows nothing about gaming would
02:06:04.119 never enter
02:06:05.360 igdc but maybe a good idea for him too
02:06:08.639 yeah if on the other side it's a great
02:06:10.400 idea obviously igdc I think is the
02:06:12.440 biggest gaming event uh gaming industry
02:06:14.960 event that happens what are some other
02:06:17.599 topics that you guys think are relevant
02:06:19.360 that I might not know about uh why for
02:06:22.800 me it's very relevant I actually want
02:06:24.280 Sean and Joseph to answer about it why
02:06:26.520 is that only bgmi and freefire were able
02:06:28.480 to do so big CM failed a lot of other
02:06:31.400 games gam games came to India tried for
02:06:33.559 two three months and failed and why is
02:06:35.159 it only bgmi and free fire on mobile
02:06:38.079 games the reason why I'm asking this
02:06:39.480 because I don't have an answer for this
02:06:40.880 except for the fact that I praise you
02:06:42.960 guys a lot that the publisher took Keen
02:06:45.000 interest in the country you guys did set
02:06:46.840 up the Esports ecosystem and everything
02:06:48.520 else this is one thing everyone would
02:06:50.280 want to know I think Joseph might be the
02:06:53.559 best person to answer this question from
02:06:55.679 the developer perspective I'm not myself
02:06:58.199 I'm not a developer uh but let me just
02:07:00.960 start as an appetizer he will serve main
02:07:04.360 this so um from my point of view um this
02:07:08.960 size of a success and I believe that the
02:07:11.760 Battle Royale game uh has opened up
02:07:15.360 India gaming industry into the different
02:07:18.119 direction uh compared to you know what
02:07:21.040 uh has existed before had existed before
02:07:23.199 that it actually happens not very often
02:07:26.480 and it doesn't really happen with a lot
02:07:28.480 of intention it happens you know very
02:07:32.040 maybe luckily or you know very um
02:07:35.000 coincidentally uh I think it could
02:07:36.800 happen because of definitely like 4G you
02:07:39.520 know penetration was there and then
02:07:41.639 there was no other jungle or game which
02:07:44.079 has that sort of reach uh before B
02:07:47.040 Royale and also ble Royale game not on
02:07:50.320 just mobile console and PC it has opened
02:07:54.119 up shooter game into different different
02:07:57.239 sort of I mean expanded uh the appeal so
02:08:00.280 that actually coincident coincide in
02:08:03.400 that time period and also after two
02:08:06.000 years covid happened which also amplify
02:08:08.840 that uh that sort of uh Trend um so I I
02:08:13.320 wanted to emphasize in a slightly
02:08:15.320 different manner for this because I feel
02:08:17.840 that if India wants to become a
02:08:19.920 Powerhouse in gaming especially game
02:08:21.960 development perspective I think young
02:08:24.400 people in India should uh try many games
02:08:28.239 and try to make their own games I
02:08:30.800 haven't seen many game developers who
02:08:33.920 become very successful in the first uh
02:08:37.480 title I think even 19yearold boy on the
02:08:40.840 Roblox he might have made 5 10 different
02:08:44.000 games and then maybe it's 11th game or
02:08:46.440 you know 15th games so I think you
02:08:49.239 should not uh try to become perfect to
02:08:53.199 start something you should try something
02:08:55.159 original on your own even if you feel
02:08:57.280 not
02:08:58.119 ready so I have a question for you you
02:09:01.719 launched bgmi in India you did RTV you
02:09:04.079 have done bullet Eco two days
02:09:05.920 ago The Spence that you are doing
02:09:08.520 towards popularizing the game or making
02:09:10.400 the Esports for that particular title
02:09:13.079 popular will it be even like what
02:09:16.040 percentage would you allot to RTV or
02:09:18.040 bullet Eco compared to bgm explain RTV
02:09:20.719 bullet well it's a game that laun stry
02:09:24.360 yeah and it took off really well and
02:09:26.079 even I was playing it and then interest
02:09:28.079 fell off because like interest fell off
02:09:30.360 for me and a lot of other creators
02:09:31.599 because we saw that the Esports
02:09:32.880 ecosystem is not building as great as
02:09:35.320 you guys are doing for bgmi because this
02:09:37.760 is like the gamer within me asking you
02:09:39.920 like how do you guys go about it and
02:09:42.239 then why someone should build every
02:09:43.800 other game if a company has biggest
02:09:45.679 Crafton is not uh you know trying to
02:09:49.199 build every game with equal interest m
02:09:51.440 um that's a that's a very good and
02:09:54.000 tricky question to answer uh but I I
02:09:56.760 will be just bold enough to answer give
02:09:59.239 give some answers um so I feel that
02:10:03.960 um uh I think you can try to make
02:10:07.040 certain game to be Esports compatible
02:10:09.800 when you first designed the game uh but
02:10:12.960 when you launch the game uh either it's
02:10:14.800 a soft launch or or commercial lunch you
02:10:17.320 find a lot of uh gap between what you
02:10:20.679 actually
02:10:21.920 felt it would work and actually it
02:10:24.440 didn't work I think in case of rotto
02:10:26.920 valer I think we felt uh that feeling
02:10:29.920 you design certain things like uh one
02:10:32.320 versus one would be fun and fun to play
02:10:35.000 and fun to watch it was fun to play in a
02:10:37.480 way but not so fun to watch uh to be
02:10:39.679 honest so we added recently like two
02:10:41.760 versus to we changed the UI for people
02:10:44.960 to naturally come into two versus to
02:10:47.320 more like Dynamic and social experience
02:10:49.800 but maybe the timing wise it's little
02:10:52.280 late uh maybe uh that's a very
02:10:54.800 interesting Insight so games today to
02:10:56.760 work have to be fun to play but also fun
02:10:59.719 to watch yeah that's my business is
02:11:03.040 built anything else that you guys think
02:11:05.440 is relevant NTI yeah I just want to add
02:11:07.679 a couple of points which I think are
02:11:09.199 very important for our young Indian
02:11:12.800 developers one is that they need to
02:11:15.559 iterate and ship
02:11:17.239 fast okay because if you start a game as
02:11:20.040 a young developer with a plan that I'll
02:11:21.960 ship it in 18 months and 24 months they
02:11:24.800 run out of money it doesn't happen right
02:11:27.559 and they lose confidence so I think
02:11:29.480 initially at least they need to take on
02:11:31.320 games and projects which are shippable
02:11:33.880 fast and then they can get the MVP out
02:11:35.920 or the minimum viable product out and
02:11:39.239 then look at the data and iterate it and
02:11:41.920 if the data is a disaster then maybe
02:11:43.360 give it one or two shots and move on to
02:11:44.880 the next project right I'm seeing I see
02:11:47.800 a lot of developers get stuck in this
02:11:49.639 Loop otherwise if they're not shipping
02:11:51.639 out and that's a big failure for many of
02:11:54.559 them so I just want to highlight that I
02:11:56.079 think the second thing is it's very
02:11:58.679 important that they focus on the right
02:12:00.880 metrics I often
02:12:02.440 say it's important for them to focus on
02:12:04.840 the real metrics versus the vanity
02:12:07.920 metrics early on and just to give a
02:12:10.400 example of what I mean usually when a
02:12:12.400 developer comes to me and says I have
02:12:16.679 50,000 downloads of my game to me
02:12:20.679 immediately that's largely a vanity
02:12:23.159 metric right I don't react much to that
02:12:26.000 because I'm being honest the downloads
02:12:29.239 May mean nothing uh but if the developer
02:12:31.920 comes and tells me my D1 retention is
02:12:35.960 40% uh my D7 retention is 20% D7 being
02:12:40.520 day7 D7 the retention of the user
02:12:42.880 suddenly my eyes will start lighting up
02:12:44.679 right I be telling my BD team okay meet
02:12:47.000 this developer do you have a mechanism
02:12:49.199 where young people can come pitch your
02:12:50.760 games
02:12:51.719 absolutely so we launched something
02:12:53.280 called nazara publishing now which is
02:12:55.960 actually meant to help developers
02:12:58.440 because we really believe that making
02:13:00.760 India is a big opportunity for Indian
02:13:02.480 Developers for India and for the world
02:13:04.719 right so we we of course have to have
02:13:06.880 that and we do have that so how does
02:13:08.440 someone pitch nazara publishing they
02:13:11.599 come to publishing. nazar.com and fill
02:13:14.440 in an application for nice do you guys
02:13:16.960 have that too at craft in
02:13:19.840 yeah I mean they are more like a pure
02:13:22.639 core we're focused on only one or two
02:13:25.520 games we can't make anything El what is
02:13:28.239 the biggest hurdle you're facing in
02:13:30.040 building the game that you are right
02:13:31.800 Talent yeah yeah because you're in India
02:13:36.960 or talent and I touched upon this before
02:13:40.159 right because there's so many people who
02:13:43.159 uh leave India and it's it's hard to you
02:13:46.119 know it's hard to argue for someone who
02:13:48.040 wants to live in another country who
02:13:49.520 wants to make dramatically more money
02:13:51.760 why would you want to stay in India um
02:13:54.440 and but if the games are going to
02:13:56.000 compete in the same Market one could
02:13:58.840 argue that you could pay them the same
02:14:00.480 amount of money once we're profitable
02:14:03.040 sure and I think that um in some
02:14:06.199 Industries like to some degree that's
02:14:08.360 starting to happen so we've seen a a
02:14:11.119 pretty fast acceleration in the
02:14:14.040 compensation of Engineers over the past
02:14:15.639 four or five years as the world became
02:14:17.119 more remote certainly after covid I
02:14:19.199 think Engineers got paid dramatically
02:14:21.119 anym right so we're starting to see some
02:14:23.360 of that impact as well but you know one
02:14:25.520 thing I would want young people to think
02:14:29.280 about really try to start with what do
02:14:32.719 you what do you want from your life I
02:14:35.320 think that's a question that not enough
02:14:37.480 young people have asked themselves and I
02:14:41.440 think that some people have bought into
02:14:44.199 like these Notions of you know the the
02:14:47.480 popularized Notions of quiet quitting s
02:14:51.320 hustle things like that and I just think
02:14:54.800 that if more people really thought
02:14:57.040 critically about what what they're
02:14:58.840 really searching for their life that
02:15:00.920 they'd be able to make better decisions
02:15:02.840 about the path that they would choose
02:15:05.440 and there's there's an exercise actually
02:15:07.520 I I believe it was clean Christensen who
02:15:09.159 wrote about an exercise that he
02:15:11.000 recommended for people which is to think
02:15:12.719 about your life um when you're on your
02:15:15.520 death bed and thinking back and what
02:15:17.920 would make you proud right like how
02:15:20.040 would you measure the value of your life
02:15:22.199 looking back I think not enough young
02:15:24.159 people do that and I I I think that
02:15:26.280 that's something that as an older guy
02:15:28.599 who didn't think about that for way too
02:15:31.000 much in my life I wish I had I want to
02:15:35.280 highlight or pick five most relevant
02:15:40.199 skill sets required to build a career in
02:15:42.840 gaming each one of you can tell me one
02:15:46.280 what do we start with you mentioned art
02:15:48.480 earlier yeah so Oh you mean the
02:15:51.119 disciplines yeah so there's probably
02:15:52.719 four main disciplines there's art uh
02:15:55.599 engineering or development um third is
02:16:00.639 uh product management or
02:16:02.960 production and
02:16:05.719 fourth design design and fifth is if I
02:16:10.119 can go with the fifth is I think which
02:16:12.119 is very important is also your data
02:16:15.360 analytics being able to understand data
02:16:18.639 and uh react to data
02:16:21.639 uh is very important okay so what does
02:16:25.239 somebody need to build a career in art
02:16:27.480 in the gaming
02:16:29.790 [Music]
02:16:31.479 world I mean get the necessary skills
02:16:35.558 also to there's there's a big difference
02:16:37.519 between 2D and 3D art uh there's a
02:16:41.200 difference between doing like like
02:16:42.799 concept art versus like production art
02:16:45.120 there's there's a lot of nuance there
02:16:47.718 within art so give me okay let's say
02:16:50.280 there's 3D art there's 2D art yeah and
02:16:53.200 then um in within that there's also like
02:16:56.760 are you focused on characters are you
02:16:58.558 focused on environment okay
02:17:02.519 um and how does somebody learn how to
02:17:05.799 make 2D art 3d art character or usually
02:17:08.599 there's there's schools for that for
02:17:10.879 example I don't know the name of the
02:17:12.920 schol something like an arena animation
02:17:15.080 or something and how much does somebody
02:17:17.879 working in the art side of gaming make
02:17:20.398 as a starting paid not much is Lower
02:17:23.439 Side is lower side but depends who the
02:17:26.398 consumer is just but lower side is how
02:17:28.558 much in
02:17:30.120 India I would say the very lowest I've
02:17:32.799 seen is like like five laks or less but
02:17:36.638 yeah entry level entry level we're
02:17:38.959 talking entry level five LS a year and
02:17:41.959 you also mentioned Joseph and nitish
02:17:44.519 actually that AI M might make this
02:17:48.120 entire section redundant very fast yeah
02:17:50.359 it might be yeah at least the lower or
02:17:52.638 middle level up to middle level maybe
02:17:54.959 very senior or maybe someone at the like
02:17:58.398 who can make some
02:18:00.638 direction maybe they but then they can
02:18:03.519 be replaced by some game designer or
02:18:05.879 yeah I mean I don't know if you guys
02:18:07.040 have checked out son. a but like if you
02:18:09.718 haven't you absolutely should you just
02:18:11.478 give it like some some descriptions
02:18:13.799 it'll automatically create music and you
02:18:16.280 can see that where that is today in two
02:18:18.200 to three years I it we could be living
02:18:21.160 in a world where most of the music we
02:18:22.638 hear is AI generated rather than
02:18:24.519 generated by human beings similarly for
02:18:27.760 art we're kind of getting to a place
02:18:31.280 where you can kind of describe things
02:18:33.398 and then just many variations just kind
02:18:35.120 of pop up um so you wouldn't recommend
02:18:39.000 if you had a 14-year-old child you
02:18:40.679 wouldn't say if I'm thinking macro I
02:18:42.519 would be like uh art no i' I'd probably
02:18:47.040 unless you really had a very specific
02:18:49.558 skill mhm because I think ultimately
02:18:52.599 Masters at their craft are Masters at
02:18:54.718 their craft but otherwise I would
02:18:57.879 probably avoid it so you're swimming
02:18:59.599 against the tide in art yes and maybe in
02:19:02.000 an engineering too because what does
02:19:04.080 what does the engineering breakdown look
02:19:06.160 like so for well I would say there's
02:19:09.718 there isn't there's more of a linear
02:19:12.959 path in engineering I I I would say
02:19:15.200 except for you're you're generally
02:19:16.638 thinking in terms of front end versus
02:19:18.398 back end and in the front end you're
02:19:20.840 generally going to be working with one
02:19:23.040 of the two primary game engines Unity or
02:19:26.280 unreal and so you would learn either C
02:19:29.120 or C++ depending on which engine you use
02:19:32.280 and then for backend um so the front end
02:19:34.920 means like the thing you actually play
02:19:37.959 right the the combat the characters that
02:19:40.120 move around all the functionality the UI
02:19:42.840 all that stuff that's that's included
02:19:44.519 there and then the backend is like when
02:19:47.160 you're saving your stats to the backend
02:19:49.200 server the net code so that you can play
02:19:51.680 against other players all the stuff you
02:19:53.240 kind of don't see but makes the game
02:19:55.280 operate in the back end M so then
02:19:57.720 generally speaking you have Engineers
02:20:00.000 oriented around one of those two either
02:20:02.040 front end or back end but you also have
02:20:04.080 some full stack guys so you would go a
02:20:06.000 seop learn how to use Unity unreal and
02:20:08.800 become really proficient in that yeah I
02:20:10.439 would probably recommend um for India
02:20:13.399 for right now Unity C but later I would
02:20:17.280 recommend C++ unreal unreal starting to
02:20:20.439 take over but you know in the long term
02:20:23.439 if current trends continue unreal is
02:20:25.600 likely the the engine of choice and the
02:20:28.160 not too distant feature nice and how
02:20:30.160 much would somebody in engineering make
02:20:32.280 on average front and back and it depends
02:20:35.120 that depends on the
02:20:36.960 school right so like if you go to IIT
02:20:39.960 and you come out you can make you know
02:20:42.080 40 50 laks I mean it's uh with no
02:20:45.160 experience with no experience it's
02:20:47.520 possible yeah assuming that you will
02:20:49.520 catch up very fast
02:20:51.200 yeah and also assuming that you will
02:20:53.000 actually get hired but he's thinking
02:20:55.200 they're lacking Talent they're looking
02:20:56.600 for people that they're actually you
02:20:58.080 know I see a lot of job openings on
02:20:59.600 LinkedIn from the popular developers or
02:21:01.760 Publishers I don't see any opening for a
02:21:04.680 newb into the industry really yes I
02:21:08.000 might be wrong here but from the
02:21:10.000 openings that I trying to go by I don't
02:21:12.800 think big studios are hiring people who
02:21:14.920 are freshers the small guys what we
02:21:16.840 still do we still hire freshers we also
02:21:20.040 we try to higher like experienced guys
02:21:24.280 uh but then it didn't work out that very
02:21:26.240 well and then there is some Gap like we
02:21:28.319 expect this level of experience but they
02:21:30.240 don't uh so which actually changed the
02:21:32.840 on the engineering side though there's a
02:21:34.040 big gap right so like we generally don't
02:21:35.880 like to hire from it just because they's
02:21:37.560 such a huge premium for those guys but
02:21:40.680 uh yeah it can come down quite a bit is
02:21:43.160 there a way somebody who does
02:21:46.120 engineering learns Unity unreal C C++
02:21:50.920 can get experience without having a
02:21:53.120 full-time job internship opportunities
02:21:56.000 uh they build their own projects uh
02:21:58.240 publish them submit them to GitHub uh so
02:22:01.600 yeah there's a lot of ways where you can
02:22:03.720 distinguish yourself as a good engineer
02:22:07.000 if you wanted to but um also I think the
02:22:11.000 thing that's missing from most of the
02:22:12.520 people that I've interviewed in India
02:22:15.200 for game development uh unlike other
02:22:17.640 places is just hardcore like math and
02:22:21.439 logic skills that's something that is
02:22:24.359 critical as an engineer but seems to be
02:22:26.560 lacking quite a
02:22:28.359 lot okay even from the IIT crowd no the
02:22:31.720 IIT guys are
02:22:34.319 fine okay do you hire from the same
02:22:38.319 place yeah but uh you know we have a
02:22:40.920 very distributed we of working so we
02:22:42.960 have different Studios that we own and
02:22:45.520 each have their own different policies
02:22:47.200 of how they are recruiting right it's
02:22:49.560 not very centralized
02:22:51.080 right right okay production product
02:22:54.800 management yeah so product management is
02:22:57.800 I would
02:22:58.960 say a pretty difficult skill to kind of
02:23:03.640 um learn on your own it does in my
02:23:07.640 opinion it requires like Hands-On
02:23:10.520 practice um but there there are a number
02:23:13.120 of online resources I we we provide some
02:23:15.319 resources as well that teach about
02:23:16.960 product management so um I can share
02:23:19.680 some of those links but I would it
02:23:21.160 typically be a engineering guy upgrading
02:23:24.000 or getting promoted to be a product
02:23:25.840 manager not necessar not usually but I
02:23:29.200 will say that in our product team at
02:23:32.439 Leela two of our product managers we
02:23:35.279 hired from engineering and similar to
02:23:37.680 Sean's
02:23:38.840 case what I have realized is that in in
02:23:41.640 our case too we prefer to hire people
02:23:43.880 who are new but hungry and wanting to
02:23:46.760 learn versus people who have worked at
02:23:49.080 an existing game company in for four to
02:23:51.160 five years
02:23:52.560 because I kind of touched upon this
02:23:54.680 before live services and live operating
02:23:57.279 a game that set of skills is very
02:23:59.319 different it's it's it's a difference
02:24:01.640 between 0o to one versus 1 to n what is
02:24:04.000 the skill the the skill in terms of like
02:24:06.680 new game development is so different
02:24:09.560 from live operations where everything's
02:24:11.680 kind of figured out it's it's like just
02:24:14.800 following the normal Playbook right I
02:24:17.720 think in new game development you have
02:24:20.800 to be kind
02:24:22.120 of brutal very effective um the
02:24:27.160 communication style there this there's
02:24:29.279 there's a whole difference in culture
02:24:31.840 and mentality for new game development
02:24:33.840 versus live operations it does it also
02:24:36.840 equate to the Nuance of scale building
02:24:40.040 for scale is that the product manager
02:24:42.000 rule well I think it's it's building for
02:24:44.439 product Market fit relative to one to
02:24:46.720 end where you are building for for
02:24:48.399 larger scale
02:24:50.640 and I'm assuming these guys get paid the
02:24:52.359 most right uh I would say Engineers
02:24:54.760 right now get paid the most more than
02:24:56.840 product managers yes so this would be
02:24:58.720 second most 30 laks 20 laks uh starting
02:25:02.880 off it's less I think starting off um
02:25:05.399 product
02:25:06.960 managers I mean again it depends on the
02:25:09.200 school but I mean you know I think
02:25:11.040 starting product managers would make 10
02:25:12.960 lcks or less I don't know you you guys
02:25:14.560 you guys know the numbers better than I
02:25:15.840 do I I I agree like product manager in
02:25:18.160 the junior level they don't make too
02:25:20.000 much different difference so their entry
02:25:23.359 uh salary would be lower slightly higher
02:25:26.240 than Aris but I think if they go to the
02:25:29.000 like the the producer like we are the
02:25:31.439 main producer level then their salary
02:25:33.240 can be as equal as Engineers I guess on
02:25:36.120 the higher end on the higher end and the
02:25:38.680 design design so I would have assumed
02:25:42.160 Art and Design are very similar no it's
02:25:44.200 not like art design it's more like
02:25:46.960 game game now I would say that design is
02:25:50.319 is the weakest area in India yeah so
02:25:54.279 finding a good designer I don't even
02:25:55.920 know where you go to learn that why
02:25:59.240 that
02:26:01.920 um I don't know yeah no no it's because
02:26:04.600 traditionally in India animation art has
02:26:08.319 always been an
02:26:09.560 industry right even job work for just
02:26:12.600 animation forget gaming similarly coding
02:26:16.520 across Industries has always been there
02:26:18.640 mhm but design specific specifically for
02:26:20.880 a game which requires how do you make a
02:26:23.960 game that is engaging right how do you
02:26:25.800 get the user in that flow State I think
02:26:29.560 that thinking it comes naturally when
02:26:32.240 you are really exposed to it over a very
02:26:33.960 long period of time so if I am a
02:26:36.000 designer a game designer I will pick
02:26:38.920 when to shoot when the real characters
02:26:41.240 come in when the static characters go
02:26:43.800 out stuff like
02:26:45.040 that the game structure the game there
02:26:48.560 not design as much as the FL complex and
02:26:52.040 it yeah it's it's complicated because
02:26:53.840 there's actually like I I would probably
02:26:55.600 characterize game design in two parts
02:26:57.960 one is gameplay right which is like for
02:27:01.439 for any kind of the the way you
02:27:02.920 typically think about a game you know
02:27:04.240 for a snake what do you do what are the
02:27:06.080 actions what is the kind of specific
02:27:07.920 things happening and then the second
02:27:09.680 part of design is systems design um you
02:27:12.359 mentioned meta right and so the The Meta
02:27:14.319 or systems part is like the progression
02:27:16.760 compulsion part where you might have a
02:27:18.920 crafting system you might be building a
02:27:20.520 house it's not the main gameplay you
02:27:22.520 might play the game earn some stuff and
02:27:24.800 then go craft something somewhere else
02:27:26.520 right but these two are generally
02:27:27.840 separate and generally like someone
02:27:30.479 great at gameplay design in terms of the
02:27:33.319 combat feel of the guns things like that
02:27:35.439 is often different from the person who
02:27:37.600 is designing the
02:27:39.319 systems I I would say the game design
02:27:42.720 requires like creativity most among all
02:27:45.720 other disciplines and then it can be
02:27:47.880 generally taught uh through some kind of
02:27:52.279 apprenticeship but it also requires kind
02:27:54.920 of natural Bor or educated creativity so
02:27:58.200 which if you don't have that uh culture
02:28:02.200 of bringing up those talents then it
02:28:04.840 might not come out easy so I I actually
02:28:07.640 think Indians could be great at design
02:28:10.120 they just need the proper educational
02:28:12.080 resources yeah the breaching that sort
02:28:14.359 of uh the creativity in their culture
02:28:17.560 and and in their brain and make it
02:28:20.200 transforming it into the more
02:28:21.640 professional or practical Evel that
02:28:23.960 actually it's difficult to happen
02:28:26.000 actually and where can the Indian learn
02:28:29.439 that a 20-year old they can start by
02:28:32.760 designing for Roblox for example right
02:28:34.680 on the ugc
02:28:36.479 platforms um but I I guess one of the
02:28:39.520 drawbacks for India is because like most
02:28:42.479 of the people I know building for Roblox
02:28:44.840 they don't do it on their phone they do
02:28:47.120 it on a PC and because there aren't a
02:28:49.000 lot of homes with PC
02:28:51.080 that may be one of the the things
02:28:53.399 holding India back um why don't they do
02:28:56.800 it on their phone it's just too
02:28:59.040 difficult right and then if you're
02:29:00.319 coding like in in Lua I mean you don't
02:29:02.600 want to be doing that on your
02:29:04.279 phone but that's different in the west
02:29:06.800 people are almost every home has PCS in
02:29:09.399 their house as well as you know tablets
02:29:11.399 and other things so but I mean I'm
02:29:13.840 similar for China there aren't a I mean
02:29:16.399 there are some places that have uh I
02:29:19.319 think there's p penetration is probably
02:29:21.000 higher in China but still not as
02:29:22.680 abundant as Like Us and other places how
02:29:24.800 much does a game designer
02:29:26.960 make
02:29:28.960 artist it varies a lot yeah it varies a
02:29:31.760 lot but pretty low maybe maybe around
02:29:34.279 what an artist makes slightly higher but
02:29:36.520 not much like as much as the art guy and
02:29:40.840 a little bit more little bit tiny bit
02:29:45.560 eight for yeah for for entry less
02:29:50.760 yeah but that's surprising because this
02:29:53.080 seems like the most critical part of the
02:29:55.520 but that's because they don't have like
02:29:56.800 if you if you were a really good game
02:29:59.359 designer then sure you you could make a
02:30:01.160 lot more and I have seen like creative
02:30:04.560 director creative director who actually
02:30:06.800 set the direction of the core gameplay
02:30:08.800 and even certain part of the outg game
02:30:11.520 uh elements they are maybe as equal as
02:30:15.800 co-founder or founder in terms of stock
02:30:18.279 options or you know uh incentives they
02:30:20.560 get from the success I mean gaming is a
02:30:22.520 creative field so yeah there's certainly
02:30:24.840 potential for high payouts data
02:30:30.359 analytics what does he do it's all about
02:30:34.200 looking at the underlying data that is
02:30:36.560 being generated by a game for example
02:30:39.600 what are the data points retention is
02:30:41.680 one of the biggest
02:30:43.200 ones for
02:30:45.200 example if 100 people played your day on
02:30:47.960 the first day when they downloaded the
02:30:50.240 game how many came back the next day now
02:30:52.840 once you know that 40 came back the next
02:30:54.760 day which is a good retention generally
02:30:57.000 you lost 60 then you need to get into
02:30:59.240 your game data and see what are the drop
02:31:01.680 off points where am I losing these users
02:31:04.200 or these players right are they
02:31:06.200 launching the game and dropping off from
02:31:08.800 the main menu of the game without
02:31:10.439 playing anything are they going into a
02:31:12.680 certain level are they getting stuck
02:31:14.560 there and then dropping off so there's a
02:31:17.200 lot of in-depth data that you need to
02:31:19.160 get into to understand how you can
02:31:21.319 improve mhm the engagement of your game
02:31:24.279 right so so I think no game can unless
02:31:27.800 it's just a hit by itself and how does
02:31:30.200 somebody learn that inculcate that
02:31:33.080 skill I think it's um is it college is
02:31:37.080 it no of course it's you need to have
02:31:39.920 very strong grip on numbers how do you
02:31:42.520 get
02:31:43.439 that I'm
02:31:45.800 assuming strong in math Etc
02:31:51.080 aptitude to data and numbers right yeah
02:31:54.160 yeah it's good aptitude to basic
02:31:55.840 aptitude and interest in data and
02:31:57.359 numbers where do you hire your data
02:31:59.000 analytics guy I think we've hired them
02:32:02.920 at least for us many of them are from
02:32:04.960 some of these good business schools
02:32:06.960 Business Schools and how much do you pay
02:32:09.240 these people
02:32:11.160 typically uh we just have our product
02:32:13.319 managers do it so we don't have like
02:32:14.640 dedicated data analy yeah I mean we for
02:32:17.920 at least at a corporate team where we
02:32:19.520 have a few people looking at data of a
02:32:22.359 lot of our uh uh
02:32:26.240 Studios maybe 2030 lakhs a
02:32:29.720 year it's a
02:32:31.640 lot that's entry level no I mean we
02:32:35.160 don't have entry level corporate we have
02:32:36.840 like six people looking at data I think
02:32:38.560 if I were to bring it down to entry
02:32:40.080 level I would assume it would be around
02:32:41.439 10 right 10 yeah now I think the
02:32:45.399 interesting question is to animes what
02:32:47.840 skill sets I think I'll just give a few
02:32:51.080 advices to how to be a gamer because
02:32:52.880 there's no rule of thumb how can you be
02:32:54.399 a
02:32:55.279 gamer uh first I would say in
02:32:59.359 India first thing backup it needs to be
02:33:01.920 mentioned that until you have reached
02:33:03.520 that spot it's always your backup thing
02:33:05.120 that you are chasing it's a passion
02:33:06.960 project to become a gamer yourself is
02:33:08.920 also a passion project at you're when
02:33:10.279 you transition from Passion to full-time
02:33:13.240 uh I would say your first contract where
02:33:16.399 you're getting paid at least 30 5K a
02:33:20.720 month rupees Rupees is where you I can
02:33:24.560 say that you are it's your profession
02:33:26.880 here on we talking about gamer or
02:33:28.520 content creator gamer gamer content
02:33:30.160 creator I don't believe should ever
02:33:31.680 chase money or contracts build on your
02:33:34.000 own there is no rule of thumb even I
02:33:35.520 cannot give any pieces of advice because
02:33:37.760 so many factors how good the person is
02:33:40.040 how creative they are how fast they go
02:33:41.800 viral what clicks what not but to a
02:33:44.000 gamer so starts there second is your
02:33:46.920 game type you know what sort of games
02:33:48.720 you played it's not not always necessary
02:33:50.720 to chase the hdle her which is like
02:33:54.120 going for Battle Royale games or a
02:33:55.479 shooting game very fine example TI MAA
02:33:58.399 who was also a part of my panel won an
02:34:00.920 Asian Games medal way back in 2017
02:34:03.000 hstone so that is another way so you can
02:34:05.560 always try to step out of your of the
02:34:07.760 normal thing and find a different game
02:34:10.359 third would be knowing the knowing so if
02:34:13.960 you're in India you want to ensure that
02:34:16.000 the publisher of that game is taking uh
02:34:18.960 enough interest in in India to build
02:34:20.399 around that game for example there's a
02:34:22.439 game called Dota 2 for say it does not
02:34:24.800 have an active India publisher interest
02:34:26.479 in India however it's a very very big
02:34:28.080 game outside as big as the there's a
02:34:30.479 event called the international which
02:34:32.120 whose price will go beyond 20 $30
02:34:34.080 million for the main event but if the
02:34:36.920 publisher is not interesting then I
02:34:38.279 would suggest don't opt for a game
02:34:39.880 because then it would be very difficult
02:34:41.600 for you to get into events or represent
02:34:43.680 India international stage because you
02:34:46.200 might be clubbed with the oceanic region
02:34:48.479 or entire South Asia region or the sea
02:34:50.359 region which is difficult fourth would
02:34:53.000 be if you're going for a team game I
02:34:55.240 would say it first so everyone ask me
02:34:57.760 how to build a team it's a very normal
02:34:59.240 question if you're playing a team game I
02:35:00.960 think you you cannot just go out and
02:35:03.359 find other professional players who
02:35:04.800 would want to build a team with you you
02:35:06.840 just start casually you get a few Gamers
02:35:09.439 get to know people online and it's a
02:35:11.720 process it could the process could be
02:35:13.800 finish in two months you might not find
02:35:16.000 a team in the next 5 years there is no
02:35:18.319 rule of thumb again it just how social
02:35:21.399 you are how well you are aligned how
02:35:24.520 well you can talk to people like you
02:35:26.000 know those elements come your
02:35:27.319 characteristic and your personality
02:35:28.600 comes into play when you're finding a
02:35:29.880 team skill though comes at a later stage
02:35:33.240 fourth would be uh once you are
02:35:36.800 contracted that's when the real hustle
02:35:38.800 start if you are ever contracted but I
02:35:40.920 believe right now in India Crafton with
02:35:44.000 this grind that craft is doing they have
02:35:45.640 recognized 256 tier one and tier two
02:35:47.960 tier one means top teams of India
02:35:50.240 there's no it's a very subjective thing
02:35:51.960 again there is no Benchmark of what a
02:35:53.920 tier one team is then there are tier two
02:35:55.319 teams who are trying to move into bigger
02:35:57.399 events and you know qualify so Crafton
02:35:59.319 has right now identified 256 teams that
02:36:01.640 means there are 256 good odd teams which
02:36:03.600 means 1250 odd players are not if not in
02:36:07.399 a contract they're doing something in
02:36:08.720 gaming and they might have treated as a
02:36:10.240 profession but I would say they are
02:36:11.920 another thousand so the number of teams
02:36:14.200 are growing there are so many teams
02:36:16.520 coming up in tier 2 cities a businessman
02:36:18.600 a shop owner trying to build a team of
02:36:20.160 his own maybe because his son insisted
02:36:22.479 so those are things happening so the
02:36:24.040 point is people need to be aware about a
02:36:25.479 gameer need to be aware of what's going
02:36:26.680 on around him don't just look at Thug or
02:36:28.840 Immortal and try to be them directly it
02:36:30.880 was not easy for everyone for anyone and
02:36:33.800 then I would say when you get contracted
02:36:36.200 that's when you start doing your
02:36:37.399 research you have to just follow the
02:36:39.520 correct way to move up the lad don't get
02:36:41.560 complacent at where you are that's what
02:36:43.279 happens even in my team you know I have
02:36:45.359 had I have guess in last six years
02:36:47.920 contracted 80 players who have moved on
02:36:49.720 to now different teams some have called
02:36:51.600 it hang their boots but I think you know
02:36:53.840 I always want my players to keep moving
02:36:55.560 on you know at a better stage even if
02:36:57.560 not better but at a p but I think it's a
02:37:00.080 a gamer needs to keep moving places
02:37:01.720 don't get stuck especially in India I
02:37:04.279 love to come hang out with you guys once
02:37:06.120 yeah you need to just for fun right just
02:37:08.680 for fun yeah I think we covered like as
02:37:11.680 much as we could yeah uh the last bit of
02:37:15.399 every episode what we do is something
02:37:17.319 for the community in this case gaming so
02:37:20.840 I ask each of you guys if you'd like to
02:37:23.240 allocate money time something like that
02:37:27.279 and then we'll put out a open poll where
02:37:30.240 we will filter and select maybe 20
02:37:34.560 people who show great potential in
02:37:36.680 gaming like what you mentioned earlier
02:37:39.120 yeah taking them to all the gaming
02:37:40.720 companies in Bangalore for example yeah
02:37:43.319 that would be great internships would be
02:37:45.359 great grants small amounts of money to
02:37:48.760 give them to
02:37:50.160 pursue any of these paths at different
02:37:53.359 stages would be great so uh nitish you
02:37:56.479 want to start off you want to
02:37:58.520 like allocate or money or time or
02:38:02.920 anything like that to help the gaming
02:38:04.560 industry absolutely I mean as India's
02:38:07.000 only listed gaming company it's are
02:38:09.319 worth 5,000
02:38:10.560 cres 6 to 250
02:38:14.600 6250 that's the least we can do and we
02:38:17.240 are already doing a lot of that yeah but
02:38:19.760 uh yeah very happy to allocate do you
02:38:21.560 want to alloc say amount and then we'll
02:38:23.800 figure out 1
02:38:27.640 CR to start with but we can double down
02:38:30.359 on that done Joseph would you I think
02:38:33.680 I've already committed to doing that
02:38:35.600 tour of some kind so I I'll do that and
02:38:37.720 certainly I think not at this point
02:38:40.359 until we're profitable but once we're
02:38:41.840 profitable we absolutely intend on
02:38:43.880 investing back into the community but
02:38:45.200 you would be okay with say the 20 that
02:38:47.840 we pick yeah allocate ating maybe like 5
02:38:50.640 hours of time just in educating them of
02:38:52.800 course some of them you might be able to
02:38:54.120 hire yeah yeah yeah
02:38:56.760 done uh I would actually love to you
02:38:59.319 know 20 that short list I would love to
02:39:01.000 mentor and actually know them why they
02:39:02.520 are getting into it and then obviously
02:39:05.000 with the uh consultancy I would like to
02:39:07.120 then offer them the Grant I first need
02:39:09.200 to like the gamer within would always
02:39:10.760 want to ensure that the person is in the
02:39:12.800 correct like wants to do something good
02:39:14.960 perfect yeah but I would love to give as
02:39:17.000 much you give them like proper time as
02:39:18.880 much time I'll I'll go down to their
02:39:20.439 city like foret no we'll pick who it
02:39:22.000 should be the who the winner should be
02:39:23.640 together right like you guys come up
02:39:25.399 with what metrics we'll put this out
02:39:27.439 thousands of people will apply we will
02:39:29.760 try and find the most talented young
02:39:31.720 minds in gaming available in India make
02:39:34.560 a group of 20 and all of this for those
02:39:36.600 20 100% And the grant would come
02:39:38.640 depending on the talent n Sean um yeah I
02:39:42.319 mean I think somewhere in this
02:39:44.399 conversation was briefly mentioned that
02:39:46.080 we started incubator program uh that is
02:39:50.240 actually
02:39:51.960 for quite professional level of
02:39:54.399 developer who has actually made at least
02:39:56.760 one or two games and they are uh capable
02:39:59.439 of launching uh the game at the
02:40:01.960 commercial level I think you meant to
02:40:04.319 help someone like before that um I think
02:40:08.479 for that we actually started to talking
02:40:11.120 about how we expand the program to cover
02:40:13.640 wider range especially for younger folks
02:40:17.680 I think we can maybe consider
02:40:20.080 to um uh the combine this so we anyway
02:40:24.680 we had a idea of expanding the incubator
02:40:27.479 program for wider teams maybe uh uh the
02:40:31.600 the in original incubator meant to uh
02:40:34.399 get like two three four team per patch
02:40:37.560 maybe six six six to eight per year I
02:40:40.240 think that uh sounds larger than that I
02:40:43.160 think that's uh that can fall into that
02:40:45.960 expanded uh extended program um we can
02:40:49.479 offer mentorship uh we can offer certain
02:40:52.960 like short duration of uh uh teaching
02:40:55.960 course uh and also we we have certain
02:40:58.560 Partners on the cloud side and Etc they
02:41:00.560 can offer also credits credit for cloud
02:41:03.200 so we we have that sort of program
