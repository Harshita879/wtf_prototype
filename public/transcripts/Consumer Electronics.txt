00:00:00.080 Today is for any young Indian boy or girl,under the age of 25,
00:00:04.360 who wants to starta consumer electronic brand.
00:00:27.920 Start? Okay, ready?
00:00:31.480 All right.
00:00:41.400 Hi, guys, thank you for coming homeand doing this.
00:00:46.480 I think Carl had to travelfrom further, further away.
00:00:50.240 -Mm-hmm.-Amit and Rahul live closer in Delhi.
00:00:54.560 So maybe we startby speaking about ourselves,
00:00:59.320 giving my audience an intro of who we are,
00:01:04.440 how we got to be where we are.
00:01:07.680 Rahul is already a friend of mine,so I know a lot about him.
00:01:11.200 But maybe we start with Carl.
00:01:14.000 Sure. I'm happy to be here.
00:01:16.280 It took a while for us to schedule itback and forth, but we're finally here.
00:01:21.920 So I'm Carl.
00:01:23.080 I'm one of the co-founders of a companycalled Nothing.
00:01:26.960 But ever since I can remember,I was always a tech fan.
00:01:30.720 I grew up in Stockholm, in Sweden.
00:01:32.440 I remember, my parents got methe first iPod.
00:01:36.600 And I was only like 12 at the time.
00:01:38.960 And the first-generation iPodwas very complicated,
00:01:42.000 because, I don't knowif you guys remember,
00:01:43.920 -it had the FireWire connection.-[Rahul] Right.
00:01:46.520 I had a PC.It didn't have the FireWire connection.
00:01:49.920 So I had to buy...First, I got the iPod, I didn't know.
00:01:53.080 -I couldn't connect it to the PC.-Right.
00:01:56.040 Then I had to buy a PCI card for FireWire,
00:01:58.800 install that, to even be ableto connect the iPod.
00:02:02.880 And back then, there was no iTunes,
00:02:04.200 so it was RealPlayer to manage the music.
00:02:08.240 Well, anyway, that productgot me really hooked on technology.
00:02:11.680 The scroll wheel was really cool,and managing the music library,
00:02:16.320 fixing all the ID3 tags for each song,getting the album arts perfect.
00:02:22.880 And a couple of years later,I was probably...
00:02:25.920 So I think I was the first to get the iPodin my entire school.
00:02:30.280 So I was a cool kid among the nerdsin the beginning.
00:02:33.720 Where was the school, Carl?
00:02:35.520 That was in Stockholm.
00:02:37.800 What year are we talking about?
00:02:39.520 iPod. When was the iPod?
00:02:41.480 2001?
00:02:42.960 Yeah. You're 36 today, right?
00:02:44.640 Yeah, I'm 35... turning 36.
00:02:48.080 So when I was 12, I got the iPod.
00:02:49.720 Really excited about that product.
00:02:51.920 Then I got the first iPhonethrough a friend in the US,
00:02:56.280 because the iPhonewas only exclusive with AT&T.
00:03:01.040 So I had a friend buy it for me,
00:03:02.360 and then we had to paya $450 cancellation fee on the contract,
00:03:07.760 and then got it shipped,and then jailbroke it,
00:03:10.240 and installed my own SIM card.
00:03:11.560 So I was the first among all my friendsto get the iPhone.
00:03:14.480 But I think those two productswere super formative for me.
00:03:17.840 I guess the third thingthat happened was...
00:03:21.240 Then I got the iPad.
00:03:22.640 I forgot which year,but the first year the iPad came out.
00:03:25.880 And I don't know if you guys remember,it used to have a skeuomorphic UI.
00:03:29.880 So, basically, the UI tried to mimichow things look like in real life.
00:03:34.080 And when you swipe from the bottom,there was a control panel.
00:03:38.760 And it was like metallic.
00:03:40.120 So you had like a volume knobthat was brushed metal.
00:03:43.360 But when you tilted the iPad,
00:03:45.440 the light source of the graphicalso changed.
00:03:49.600 So, I'm like, "Oh, my God,
00:03:51.200 like, if Apple thinks aboutevery little detail like this...
00:03:56.440 I can trust them on like...They've figured everything out."
00:03:59.520 So those three moments made me a big fanof this industry and of Apple.
00:04:04.960 Do you still feel that way about Apple?
00:04:07.440 No, it's a very different company now.
00:04:09.640 When did it change?
00:04:11.320 I think the change has been gradual.
00:04:13.320 I think the two CEOs have hada very different approach
00:04:17.800 to running the company.
00:04:20.839 I mean, the stock price doesn't lie.
00:04:22.640 I think Tim Cook has done a great jobon the shareholder value creation side.
00:04:28.080 But when it just comes to inspiringa young guy or a young person
00:04:32.200 to take a career in tech, I thinkthe old Apple was way better at that.
00:04:38.520 So really inspired by those products.
00:04:40.720 And then, I was chronically onlineas a kid.
00:04:43.520 My parents were busy.
00:04:44.960 They were always at work,but I got a laptop computer,
00:04:48.440 and I got fibre Internetat a very young age
00:04:50.960 because the infrastructurewas pretty well developed in Sweden.
00:04:55.520 -At 12, you had...-Fibre.
00:04:57.920 -And phone, access to phone.-I had a Nokia 3210.
00:05:02.320 -At 12 years old.-Yeah.
00:05:04.880 So then fast forward to later,so I had the Internet.
00:05:07.840 Started making friends online'cause I felt like the friends around me,
00:05:12.840 they only saw a very small partof the world.
00:05:15.040 Whereas online,you can connect with anybody.
00:05:18.640 So I made a very good friend.
00:05:20.840 We were chatting on MSN Messengerevery single day
00:05:23.720 about how to make money online.
00:05:26.280 We were both writing blogsand making websites and all that stuff.
00:05:30.840 And then, he then becamethe youngest founder
00:05:34.080 to get into Y Combinator.
00:05:36.000 And he's, like, two years younger than me.
00:05:38.000 -Wow.-I was very jealous when he got in.
00:05:40.720 He was probably 17 or something.
00:05:43.440 And so that was also my plan.
00:05:45.160 So after uni,I'm going to apply for Y Combinator.
00:05:48.000 So it was a different time,when consumer Internet
00:05:50.080 was still very, like, boomingwith Facebook and all that.
00:05:53.520 What's really working for Y Combinator?
00:05:56.400 We're trying to start something like thatcalled WTFund,
00:05:59.320 which is a non-dilutive grant programmewhere we don't take equities.
00:06:04.920 It's not too much like Y Combinator,but a different version of it.
00:06:10.200 Why have they been so successful?
00:06:12.960 I don't know. I haven't thought about it.
00:06:14.240 When I was young,I just wanted to go there,
00:06:16.560 because I thought that was the placeyou had to go
00:06:19.480 if you wanted to becomea Silicon Valley founder.
00:06:25.160 They made a lot of... They've beena kingmaker in the industry, I think.
00:06:28.920 I'm sure they have someunique way of figuring out
00:06:32.360 who's a good fit in terms of founders.
00:06:35.000 And then they have their brand.
00:06:36.880 And then they preparethe founders for, like...
00:06:40.280 the subsequent funding roundsin a pretty smart way.
00:06:43.560 Like, even when I'm raising money,
00:06:45.800 sometimes, I referencethe Y Combinator docs,
00:06:49.440 like, the guides for how to raise money.
00:06:52.080 Do you think it's networkor access to capital?
00:06:55.160 The capital is very little, actually.
00:06:57.320 -Half a million.-Yeah. It was even less before.
00:07:00.240 And they take a lot of stakefor that money.
00:07:03.960 But I think it's a branding thing.
00:07:05.320 Like, once you have that brandon your resume,
00:07:08.680 your next round will be a lot easier.
00:07:10.360 And your next, next roundwill be a lot easier.
00:07:12.760 And they do have good content to teach.
00:07:14.920 Maybe that's their user acquisition.Right?
00:07:17.760 Having good content to teach young peoplewhy you should start a company,
00:07:22.280 how you should start a company.
00:07:23.600 And then once they're ready,they inbound to YC.
00:07:27.760 Okay. And then?
00:07:29.360 So I was planning to go to YC,and then I was playing a lot of games.
00:07:35.440 A lot of League of Legends at that time.
00:07:38.240 -It wasn't very...-Games as in, like, video games?
00:07:40.840 -Yeah, like online computer games.-Online games.
00:07:45.040 So I was a bit lazy,so I didn't write my application.
00:07:47.880 But then I got a phone call from the CEOof Meizu back then.
00:07:53.840 He's like, "Hey,we want to become more international.
00:07:57.720 Do you want to help?"
00:07:59.280 So I had like two options.
00:08:00.400 Either I have to writemy application for YC,
00:08:02.840 or I can go to China to join Meizu.
00:08:05.480 I took the path of least resistanceand didn't finish my university.
00:08:11.960 I moved to Hong Kong in 2011.
00:08:15.960 -For Meizu?-For Meizu.
00:08:17.360 Just for the...Meizu was the Apple of China at that time.
00:08:23.600 They were the first oneto come up with a phone. Yeah.
00:08:26.200 -The first Chinese smartphone.-Yes, it was Meizu.
00:08:29.480 They made really great MP3 players before.That's when I got to know the company.
00:08:37.559 And then, yeah, to be a partof the beginning of something interesting,
00:08:40.760 that's why I moved.
00:08:42.640 And also out of laziness,
00:08:44.400 to not have to write the thesisfor university
00:08:46.840 and the application for YC.
00:08:49.040 And the reason why he reached out to mewas because,
00:08:52.000 after I discovered their products in 2006,
00:08:55.800 I made an online fan communityabout that company.
00:08:58.960 And it got quite big.
00:09:00.600 We got to like 70,000 users, members.
00:09:04.040 We were updating, like, people
00:09:05.600 on the new firmware updatesand customisation, and all that stuff.
00:09:10.280 And then I think he saw something in thatand decided to call.
00:09:14.200 So the founder of Meizucalled you himself?
00:09:16.480 -The CEO.-Yeah?
00:09:18.200 -The professional CEO.-Wow.
00:09:21.080 Okay. And you were in Nokiafor three months?
00:09:23.320 Yeah, that was before that.Just for like a summer internship.
00:09:26.560 Right. And after Meizu?
00:09:29.600 So I didn't stay that long.
00:09:32.200 I think I stayed, like, a year.
00:09:34.800 I left because I quickly realisedthat it was a family business.
00:09:38.560 So the key positionswere all family members.
00:09:40.800 And it's hard to build a very big companylike that, I think.
00:09:45.640 Was the professional CEO a family member?
00:09:48.520 He wasn't.
00:09:49.920 But imagine how hard it was for himto do his work.
00:09:53.800 But head of finance,head of international.
00:09:57.520 It's probably not gonna work.
00:09:58.600 So I started applying for jobs.
00:10:01.360 I applied for Xiaomi.
00:10:03.120 I applied for OPPO.
00:10:06.760 I applied for another companythat's no longer here, called Smartisan.
00:10:11.240 Yeah, yeah.
00:10:13.680 Smartisan had that... They had that...
00:10:15.240 This is a Bangalore-based startup, right?
00:10:17.200 No, no, no. This is based out of Beijing.
00:10:21.320 Yeah, back in the day.
00:10:23.840 With their Hammer UI and all that.
00:10:25.640 -Is it?-Mm-hmm.
00:10:26.840 Yeah.
00:10:27.920 -Yeah, they did some good design.-[Rahul] Yeah.
00:10:30.160 The Smartisan guy never responded to me.
00:10:33.120 I interviewed at Xiaomi and OPPO.
00:10:35.760 And to be honest, I think back then,Xiaomi was a rocket ship.
00:10:41.400 Like, venture-backed.
00:10:42.760 I think Sequoia and a bunch ofreally well-known VCs were backing them.
00:10:48.040 -DST and all of them. Yeah.-DST.
00:10:50.000 So I was actually quite intimidatedby the people I met there.
00:10:54.320 Like, everybody that interviewed with meat Xiaomi felt very aggressive,
00:10:58.440 like, results-oriented, very smart.
00:11:01.480 Whereas when I interviewed with OPPO,
00:11:03.440 I felt more like a traditionalmanufacturing culture.
00:11:08.000 So selfishly,I thought that if I joined this
00:11:11.200 less aggressive culture, I can shine more.
00:11:13.840 Did you get a job at Xiaomi as well?
00:11:16.200 I dropped out of the interview process
00:11:18.440 after we made an agreementwith OPPO at that time.
00:11:22.240 Yeah, so then OPPO also sawthe rise of Xiaomi.
00:11:27.640 Because Xiaomi was selling phones online,
00:11:29.280 they were the firstto do that in the world.
00:11:31.160 And they could undercut other people
00:11:33.640 because the distribution costwas a lot lower.
00:11:36.160 So OPPO was also trying to find a strategyto hedge against the rise of Xiaomi.
00:11:43.520 So they created a new brandcalled OnePlus.
00:11:46.640 It was supposed to be online,
00:11:48.640 by leveraging the supply chainthat OPPO had built.
00:11:51.240 Because Xiaomi wasstill building their supply chain,
00:11:53.080 they didn't have those advantages.
00:11:54.320 Is OnePlus still a part of OPPO?
00:11:56.400 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:58.960 So then, I had just joined.
00:12:02.240 And I was like, "Hey, I can't just joinand then you start a new company.
00:12:07.840 Like, I want to be a partof the new company."
00:12:10.200 But then I was told that the new companyis not for international,
00:12:13.320 it's just for China.
00:12:15.880 To fight Xiaomi in China.
00:12:17.840 But I kind of made the casethat it doesn't hurt, right?
00:12:20.960 Like, if I can run international,it's all free money.
00:12:25.320 Like, you guys can still focus on China,
00:12:28.320 and everything else is just extraon top of that.
00:12:30.720 So that's how I, in the beginning,got the opportunity.
00:12:34.600 I was only 24 to run international.
00:12:38.880 Were you more a marketing personat this point
00:12:41.400 or were you morethe technical person at this point?
00:12:43.760 I was more marketing, I think.
00:12:46.520 I was kind of like a...
00:12:48.320 'Cause ever since I was 12when I got that computer,
00:12:50.280 I started making websites.
00:12:51.600 And then I built traffic,sold advertising.
00:12:54.080 So like just...
00:12:55.840 I had a deep desire to make moneywhen I was young.
00:12:58.160 So more like business/marketing,just trying to make it work, hustling.
00:13:03.880 So that's kind of what we did.
00:13:05.880 After one year,after launching the product at OnePlus,
00:13:10.560 China did $100 million in revenue.
00:13:12.480 International did $200 million.
00:13:14.560 China lost money,international made money.
00:13:16.920 And then we decided to pivotthe entire company
00:13:18.880 to be more focused on international.
00:13:21.400 'Cause the competition in Chinawas too high.
00:13:23.880 -Yeah.-So that was the OnePlus journey.
00:13:27.480 Spent seven years at OnePlus.
00:13:32.560 Very grateful because I was just a kid.
00:13:34.360 Like, being able to participatein such a high CapEx industry
00:13:39.240 without needing to use my own money.
00:13:42.120 I didn't have money.
00:13:44.240 So, very gratefulfor all those opportunities.
00:13:46.280 Allowing me to failwith a lot of crazy ideas
00:13:48.440 and learning from those.
00:13:50.800 Ultimately, it's kindof like a CPG strategy
00:13:53.640 where we buy componentsfrom different suppliers,
00:13:56.840 we package the components,
00:13:58.760 and we have a unique positionin the market,
00:14:01.240 design, brand, and sell the product.
00:14:05.040 I had done that for seven years.
00:14:06.360 I didn't feel likethat's what I wanted to do my entire life.
00:14:11.560 I want to not only implementother people's technology,
00:14:15.720 I also want the opportunity to eventuallyimpact how people use technology.
00:14:21.960 So I knew I had to go independent.
00:14:26.040 So I left in 2020, in September.
00:14:29.440 And on my birthday,that was like a birthday gift for myself.
00:14:34.280 And started this new companycalled Nothing.
00:14:38.320 It's been four and a half years.
00:14:40.320 We underestimated the difficultyin building this, but we're still around.
00:14:45.640 So, very grateful to still haveopportunities to build a company.
00:14:51.760 But it was a bit tougher than we expected.
00:14:55.280 Are you branding your phoneby keeping it there?
00:14:57.720 Yeah, it's free exposure. [chuckles]
00:15:01.560 It has a very distinctive back, right?
00:15:03.600 Yeah, so that's our entire thing.
00:15:05.840 We...
00:15:07.280 It's a very mature industry,
00:15:10.120 and it's very hard to competebecause everybody is at very high scale.
00:15:14.480 So they have a lot of advantages.
00:15:17.560 We're not reinventing the category.
00:15:19.640 It was invented a long time agoby somebody else.
00:15:22.680 So, for us, it's all about carving outa small position in the market first.
00:15:27.640 We don't have to have everybody love us.
00:15:30.480 It's okay if 90% of people don't careabout us or hate us
00:15:34.480 as long as we get a niche groupof consumers who really love us.
00:15:40.000 That works in our industrybecause it's so big.
00:15:43.000 Maybe it doesn't workfor smaller categories.
00:15:45.600 So, for us, we chose to differentiatethrough design
00:15:49.120 because it was the fastest wayto differentiate.
00:15:52.000 If we picked technology,it would take years to play out.
00:15:55.960 It's a lot of investment, a lot of years.
00:15:59.640 We also didn't want to reinventthe product category.
00:16:02.360 Like, if we have crazy ideason a new gadget,
00:16:06.560 we might spend yearson trying to build it.
00:16:08.920 And then if we launch it,you only have one chance.
00:16:11.760 If people don't like it, you're screwed.
00:16:13.880 Yeah, so we start with hardware design,then we move to software design.
00:16:18.040 Now we're investing more and moreinto the OS itself, into AI.
00:16:22.800 So I think, for us, it's about buildingdifferentiation and modes over time.
00:16:27.320 But in a gradual way.
00:16:28.640 Don't move too fast because thenyou might, kind of, fall off the horse.
00:16:32.360 So, for a companyheadquartered in Sweden...
00:16:36.640 -UK.-UK.
00:16:39.320 The trade war will affect you how?
00:16:41.240 Tariffs?
00:16:42.480 So, now, the most direct way is...
00:16:46.760 Trump had new tariffsfor manufacturing from China.
00:16:50.320 So we manufacture the earbuds in China.
00:16:53.520 And that's like a 20% hit on our...
00:16:57.880 -[Amit] Import.-...business plans for the US market.
00:17:00.880 So now we need to lookat alternative sources of manufacturing
00:17:04.359 like India, like Vietnam,
00:17:05.839 where it makes the most sense.
00:17:08.280 It's the first time where, you know,every night, 10pm, I go on CNN.com.
00:17:13.079 See. He must have woken up.
00:17:15.440 What is the new news?
00:17:16.760 And then go to sleep.
00:17:18.280 But it won't affect you as muchif you're getting stuff from China
00:17:21.400 and selling in India, right?
00:17:23.280 No, it's not about that getting from...
00:17:25.640 See, because the supply chain right nowis there in China.
00:17:28.600 And then all the manufacturing nowis coming to India.
00:17:32.480 But it's not about China,it's about India also.
00:17:35.880 Because, you know, reciprocal tariffsand all those sort of things.
00:17:39.280 But I would assume it would hurt you mostif you're selling something in the US.
00:17:43.960 Certainly, yes.
00:17:45.600 But now we're talking aboutthe whole industry, you know, per se.
00:17:48.200 So, you know,if you see the reciprocal tariff,
00:17:51.600 even on mobile phones.
00:17:53.800 It's, you know, it's 16.5%.
00:17:59.640 Right?
00:18:00.720 So if anything coming into India,there is a duty of 16.5%.
00:18:05.280 Going to US as of now is 0%.
00:18:08.200 So reciprocal means...
00:18:10.120 At some level, doesn't it sound fair?
00:18:12.760 Like, I'm just...I have no affinity to America.
00:18:17.080 And I'm the biggest proponentof India built for India,
00:18:20.640 supporting Indian product.
00:18:23.120 But, if tomorrowI was selling to country X, Y, Z.
00:18:28.320 And I was selling them somethingand they were charging me 30% duty on it,
00:18:33.960 if I was buying something from them,
00:18:37.880 I would assume the same duty should apply.
00:18:40.200 Yeah, I think so.
00:18:41.960 Like, inherently, it's logical, no?
00:18:43.920 -Yeah, but I have a different view.-Yeah.
00:18:45.840 See, it's not binary.It's not, you know-- It depends:
00:18:49.480 How do you want to bring up your country?What are your policies, for example?
00:18:53.360 We've been discussing about China a lot.
00:18:56.320 In China, way back, they decided
00:18:58.440 that they are not going to allowthe foreign companies.
00:19:00.480 Foreign companies can only come with JVs
00:19:02.400 because they want to buildtheir champions.
00:19:06.560 But then, how can they do that,
00:19:09.840 +but sell to other countriesat the scale that they are selling
00:19:13.920 and creating these deficits?
00:19:15.360 No, but they created that scale, right?
00:19:17.840 So, see, if you see exampleshow great countries are built.
00:19:24.240 It's all about the companiesthat, you know...
00:19:28.520 If you have great companies,the country will prosper.
00:19:31.560 And the United Statesis the biggest example.
00:19:35.440 Same thing, you know,China worked on that way back.
00:19:38.720 And so, if Mercedes-Benzhave to, you know...
00:19:44.480 they want to sell and they say,"Do a joint venture with our company."
00:19:48.080 Everyone, Hyundai, or...all of them in the automobile.
00:19:52.040 Softwares... Never allowed Google,Microsoft, you know, all those players.
00:19:56.560 They build their own companies,and they...
00:19:59.280 We all know about that.
00:20:02.400 So, if it was like what we are discussing
00:20:04.920 that yes, sitting across the table,okay, if you do this, I do this.
00:20:07.800 Then all these things-- Then Googlewould have been there probably...
00:20:10.640 Or Amazon would have been there.
00:20:12.200 I don't think so whetherthey will be having an Alibaba or not
00:20:14.680 or whether there was this Baidu,
00:20:16.800 you know, all those playerswould have been existing or not.
00:20:19.480 But I'm making the presumptionthat classical economic theory suggests
00:20:26.080 that free markets are the fastest way
00:20:30.720 to improve quality and get competitive.
00:20:33.320 Like, I do see your point.
00:20:34.960 I remember reading somewhere in history
00:20:38.200 that back in the daywhen UK was not doing well,
00:20:41.200 they shut off from the world,
00:20:43.320 isolated their domestic industrypre-industrial revolution
00:20:47.320 and they didn't allow foreign productsfor a while
00:20:50.120 to help their internal industry to growto a point where it can be competitive.
00:20:55.600 So maybe there's a point to that.
00:20:57.880 But when I look at it very simplistically,
00:21:00.480 if Nikhil is selling somethingand Rahul is selling something,
00:21:05.800 if each time Rahul is selling something,
00:21:08.600 there is a certain additional tax
00:21:10.680 outside of the cost of growth producedin Rahul's margin,
00:21:14.480 the same should apply to Nikhil as well.
00:21:16.200 Certainly. So as I said, likewise,it sounds very, it's simple, it's logical.
00:21:20.800 But, you know,when you're building your countries,
00:21:24.480 you know, the whole narrativechanges in that.
00:21:26.320 And that's how all these FTA treatiesare being worked out.
00:21:29.720 -[Nikhil] Yeah.-Yeah.
00:21:30.840 They've supported the ecosystem alsoin a big way,
00:21:33.680 if you look at all Chinese companies.
00:21:35.640 I mean, all, like-- You're talking aboutInternet companies,
00:21:38.840 they never allowed US companiesto come in.
00:21:41.680 In fact, there is no Uber also there.
00:21:43.880 Amazon also had to sell outtheir business there.
00:21:46.480 I mean, somehowthey're protected for the Indian--
00:21:48.720 their Chinese companies to grow, actually.
00:21:51.040 That's how, I mean,that's how their whole strategy,
00:21:53.440 you know, has been worked out.
00:21:54.920 So, today, we talkabout semiconductors here.
00:21:57.160 They started workingon semiconductors 20 years back.
00:21:59.240 -[Carl] Yeah.-And now the results are coming.
00:22:01.520 They're like 3,200 companiesworking on semiconductors.
00:22:05.560 Most patents are being filed there. So...
00:22:09.840 Carl, can I ask you another question?
00:22:11.960 Mm-hmm.
00:22:13.880 For a kid who moved from China to the US
00:22:17.360 with two PhD parents,
00:22:20.320 and a deep desire to make moneywhile young,
00:22:23.000 where does that come from?
00:22:24.920 I'm sure there's some childhood trauma,
00:22:27.560 but I've never explored that pathto understand more.
00:22:30.000 What do you suspect it could be?
00:22:32.520 I think just being... not fitting in,
00:22:35.600 the feeling of not fitting in,you know, like...
00:22:37.800 But you're a young, good-looking guy.Why not fitting in?
00:22:40.200 'Cause I grew up in white societiesas a minority.
00:22:44.480 Racist? Back then?
00:22:46.240 I think it's not, like, explicitly racist,
00:22:50.920 but it's like, you're justnot the same, right?
00:22:54.360 Like, I could tell.
00:22:56.560 I think there's something to do with that.
00:22:58.680 US more so or Sweden?
00:23:01.720 -I think both.-Is that all?
00:23:05.520 Childhood?
00:23:06.600 I think childhood traumais a big part of it,
00:23:08.800 but I haven't gone to a therapistto unpack all of that.
00:23:13.480 There's also, I think, a fear of death.
00:23:17.520 You know, I rememberwhen I was very young,
00:23:21.080 I was very angry at my parentsfor giving birth to me.
00:23:25.480 Because now I have to die,and that's terrible.
00:23:27.960 "Why did you do this?"
00:23:29.320 -This is at what age?-Eight, I think.
00:23:31.880 So there's like this fear.
00:23:34.040 And my best answer is, like,this is going to be a journey.
00:23:39.160 Life is a journey.
00:23:40.920 I got the conclusionfrom the movie Life of Pi.
00:23:43.680 [Rahul] Mm-hmm.
00:23:44.960 The kid is on a boat,meets a lot of animals,
00:23:47.880 but actually it didn't happen.
00:23:50.160 Just made it upto make the journey more pleasant.
00:23:55.560 So it's all about the journey,and I think by doing something ambitious,
00:23:59.080 doing something different,the journey will be a lot more fun.
00:24:02.080 So that's also a driver, I think.
00:24:04.440 Do you feel like nothing has meaning?
00:24:06.320 Are you nihilistic,stoic in your thinking?
00:24:09.200 I think the journey has meaning,
00:24:11.200 but I don't thinkthere's much beyond death.
00:24:16.120 Well, thank you.
00:24:18.240 Rahul, would you like to go next?
00:24:22.080 Tell us about your life.
00:24:23.520 Start from the beginning, from Delhi.
00:24:26.240 -You know...-I know, but they don't know.
00:24:32.520 So, yeah, I grew up in Delhi.
00:24:37.600 Born in a middle class family,
00:24:39.200 father was a school teacher,
00:24:41.880 mother was a housewife.
00:24:44.360 Youngest kid in the family.
00:24:48.600 Growing up, just wanted to do something.
00:24:53.360 Nobody was doing business in my family.
00:24:54.760 Because, you know, all...
00:24:56.400 But I don't know how I picked up that,
00:24:58.680 but that I will always do somethingof my own.
00:25:01.480 This was probably when I was...
00:25:05.920 maybe, if I remember,around 10 years or 12 years,
00:25:10.240 I just wanted to do something of my own.
00:25:13.080 And I was pretty clearthat I will not work for anybody else.
00:25:16.720 Despite knowing that there is no capital.
00:25:18.640 Why?
00:25:20.120 No... A school teacher,how much capital will you have?
00:25:23.600 No, why will you not work for anyone else?
00:25:27.200 Because I just thought thatI want to do something different in life,
00:25:32.800 in terms of something meaningful.
00:25:36.000 I am not saying impact,
00:25:37.280 because, at that time,it was not about impact,
00:25:39.520 it was about survival.
00:25:42.720 You said this to me personallyat different points.
00:25:46.600 Even when I sat with you
00:25:48.920 and had the fund raise,dilution conversation.
00:25:53.320 You always said, we won't raise X,
00:25:58.680 because control will go away.
00:26:01.320 Or we will have somebody elsewe are answerable to.
00:26:04.400 Why did you never want to workfor anyone else?
00:26:08.080 And why do you neverwant to give up control
00:26:11.000 or your position in that ecosystem?
00:26:12.960 Yeah, so I think we will break upin these two parts.
00:26:17.080 First, not work for anyone,
00:26:18.680 because I wanted, as I said,to do something different,
00:26:22.600 something big, something meaningful.
00:26:27.120 And I...
00:26:29.200 -Jai, get me some coffee, please.-Yes, sir.
00:26:31.240 I remember this conversationwith my friends at that time,
00:26:33.640 and we used to go and play in parks,that I will do something of my own.
00:26:41.480 And they would also ask the same question.
00:26:43.440 But I think there was a deep desirein terms of wanted to...
00:26:50.920 wanted to be known for something.
00:26:54.280 Why?
00:26:57.360 This is the problem with him.
00:27:01.600 No, but...
00:27:02.840 So why?
00:27:04.200 Maybe because when I was growing up,
00:27:08.280 I saw, you know...
00:27:13.320 how people were and how things weregoing on in terms of whatever access.
00:27:20.160 So because we were havingvery limited access to things.
00:27:23.520 So you are 50 now.
00:27:25.680 Your formative years were '90s?
00:27:30.680 -When India was opening up?-Yeah.
00:27:33.120 Yeah. You know, end of, let's say...you can say...
00:27:37.160 When I started working, it was 2000, yeah.
00:27:40.120 Right. What did you see thenwhich made you want to do these things?
00:27:43.960 So first, you know, I just told my dad...he said, "What do you want to do?"
00:27:49.280 I said, "I just want to dosomething of my own."
00:27:50.880 -He said, "What?"-I said, "I have no idea.
00:27:53.760 But buy me a computer."
00:27:55.560 Because all my friends, whether they weredoing civil or mechanical or electronics,
00:28:00.720 everybody was going in software.
00:28:01.840 So I said I want to dosomething in software.
00:28:03.600 [Nikhil] Mm-hmm.
00:28:05.320 And bought that computer.
00:28:10.160 And I clearly rememberwhen I bought that computer,
00:28:12.160 I had no idea about computersat that time.
00:28:13.920 Windows came,and Windows was there at that time.
00:28:17.040 So I went to the guywho was selling the computer.
00:28:19.800 He said, "What computer do you want?"
00:28:21.600 I said, "It should have lot of iconson the screen."
00:28:26.720 It used to have shortcuts, actually.
00:28:28.680 I never knew about that.
00:28:29.760 I said, "It should have lot of iconson the screen."
00:28:34.000 And that's how...
00:28:35.920 So he laughed at me.
00:28:38.560 "He has no idea."
00:28:40.800 He gave me.
00:28:42.120 And then I bought a book.
00:28:47.320 "Learn VB in 21 days."
00:28:49.480 -Visual Basic.-Visual Basic, yeah.
00:28:52.280 I wrote a program in three days.
00:28:54.640 Hello world, this, that.I thought, "Okay, I know programming now."
00:28:57.960 My friend came, he saw the book.He said, "You've done this?"
00:29:00.720 I said, "Yeah, I made a program."He said, "Can I take this?"
00:29:02.480 I said, "Yeah, take it."
00:29:04.080 So he took that book away.
00:29:05.560 That guy later became my partner.So the story...
00:29:08.840 And he is a core techie guy.
00:29:10.680 Coding only.
00:29:12.520 So I tell himyou become a coder because of me.
00:29:15.640 So, by virtue of buying that computer,that decision,
00:29:18.920 we started working on...
00:29:20.680 So I started looking for opportunitiesin software.
00:29:22.800 That, what can I do in software.
00:29:25.200 2000 was like the software bust time, no?
00:29:28.160 Yeah, the dot-com.
00:29:29.400 So, this is like '99 or so.
00:29:31.600 You started Micromax in 2000.
00:29:33.560 No, actually 1998.
00:29:36.360 1998, with the three friends.
00:29:39.200 -Four friends.-[Nikhil] Four friends.
00:29:41.120 Started with three, fourth camefrom US and then joined here.
00:29:44.720 Then started, you know,working on software,
00:29:46.360 just worked on a lot of SAP.
00:29:48.400 That went down.
00:29:50.920 Then started working on e-commerce,
00:29:53.480 that Y2K problems and all that.So, at that time, I was in US.
00:29:57.440 So I was the BD guy,doing marketing and sales,
00:30:00.640 and rest of the other guys weredoing the coding and everything.
00:30:03.360 So, at that time,we wrote a lot of B2B engines
00:30:06.280 for e-commerce and doing all that.
00:30:13.200 So, you know, that was the timewhen Sun Microsystems was there,
00:30:16.040 and it was like we had the dot in dot-com.
00:30:20.400 And then that market went down,and then we realised
00:30:23.840 that it is a very fast-moving market,
00:30:25.280 and you have to, you know,constantly change yourself
00:30:27.360 very quickly to be relevant.
00:30:29.960 We moved on to embedded technology,
00:30:31.520 started workingwith University of Irvine, California.
00:30:34.360 They had an R&D centre on embedded.
00:30:36.800 We started working together.
00:30:39.240 And, at that time, Nokia, in India,
00:30:41.680 was lookingfor a machine-to-machine partner, M2M.
00:30:46.360 HCL was their partnerfor their mobile phones,
00:30:50.040 and they were looking for someonefor a machine-to-machine.
00:30:52.240 And we got introduced.
00:30:55.360 And they said,"Would you like to do something?"
00:30:57.360 You know, we used to write device drivers,
00:31:01.320 doing, you know, work ona lot of different architectures.
00:31:07.400 ARM, PowerPC and all that.
00:31:09.360 Said okay, started doing that.
00:31:13.480 And then, one fine day,
00:31:18.040 I was just sitting with one of the guysfrom Nokia, Finland.
00:31:21.640 And he showed me a product.
00:31:24.440 I said, "What is this?"
00:31:25.520 He said, "This is one of the productswherein if you put a SIM card in this,
00:31:28.800 you can connect a telephonealong with this,
00:31:33.080 and it will replace the landline."
00:31:35.240 So I said, "Good.So why did you make this product?"
00:31:38.800 He said, "In Finland, you know,
00:31:40.000 because there are a lot of snowand everything,
00:31:42.160 you can't lay the copper wire...the telephone.
00:31:45.800 So you can put a SIM card in thisand connect a phone
00:31:48.200 and then you have a landline,
00:31:49.320 because this phone is going to be fixed,nobody's going to take it."
00:31:53.320 He said, "Can you do something with this?"
00:31:57.360 I said, "India, how much would this...
00:31:59.400 we don't have marketfor something like this."
00:32:04.200 So I took that product from him.I said, "Okay, let me just play."
00:32:10.320 And we found an opportunity and I wentback to him the next day and said,
00:32:14.440 we would like to powerthe payphone machines.
00:32:17.840 Yes.
00:32:19.360 So we went to Airtel and all those guys...
00:32:25.640 and all the GSM players,
00:32:27.720 said, we can power payphoneswith one SIM card.
00:32:31.800 At that time, payphone in Indiawas only MTNL and BSNL,
00:32:34.280 government companies laying down the wire.
00:32:37.080 You mean the STD centre?
00:32:38.960 STD centre, STD meets.
00:32:42.680 So they said, "Okay, how can you do that?"
00:32:44.560 We said, "This is, you know,with that phone,"
00:32:46.200 because we were writing device driversand everything,
00:32:48.120 we took that machine,change the code and everything,
00:32:51.960 put our software, attach the landline,
00:32:54.720 and say, you put a SIM card,and you can work.
00:32:58.800 They said, good.
00:33:00.600 And then it was also a solution,good solution for corporates,
00:33:03.400 because corporates, if they want to havea connection straight away,
00:33:06.080 you can just, you know, integrate itwith the EPABX systems and all.
00:33:10.080 So it worked for them.
00:33:13.080 And from a small Delhi-based company,
00:33:17.040 we started growing to all the statesand started supporting all the carriers.
00:33:20.840 Airtel, that time, it was Hutchand Idea and all.
00:33:25.640 We started supplying to them.
00:33:27.680 The business was started doingreasonably okay.
00:33:30.160 From three, four crore rupees annually,
00:33:34.600 we started doing around 100 crore rupees.
00:33:37.760 -And, you know, very quickly we scaled up.-What year was this?
00:33:42.480 This, I think 2003.
00:33:44.800 Hundred crore thenis like thousand crore now.
00:33:47.880 More.
00:33:50.040 A lot more.
00:33:51.480 So we were happy.
00:33:52.560 We thought that okay, we have arrived,something is happening.
00:33:55.080 So that business was doing well.
00:33:56.720 So one day I got a callfrom this Finnish guy.
00:34:00.120 I remember his name, Henry.
00:34:02.120 So Henry said, "Rahul, can we meet?"I said, "Absolutely."
00:34:06.040 Said, "Why?"
00:34:07.120 He said, "I have good newsand bad news for you."
00:34:10.000 I said, "Tell me what?"He said, "No, come over to my home."
00:34:13.719 Went to his home.
00:34:16.239 He said, "What do you like to listen?"I said, "Tell me the bad news first."
00:34:19.600 He said, "Bad news is that
00:34:21.560 Nokia, we have soldthe whole machine-to-machine business."
00:34:24.880 What year was this?
00:34:26.639 It's 2003.
00:34:28.400 2003, 2004.
00:34:29.840 Back then they were killing it, right?Nokia was the market leader?
00:34:33.800 Number 1 to number 10 was Nokia.
00:34:35.480 Then started 11, 12, 13. Yeah.
00:34:38.280 So I said, "What is the good news?"
00:34:40.880 He said, "Good news is that
00:34:42.080 as Nokia, now we are cominginto car accessories business.
00:34:45.000 We want you to distributeour car accessories."
00:34:50.159 So those car accessories, you know,they had speakers.
00:34:52.199 You could put in those,that lighter socket.
00:34:57.080 -[Nikhil] Mm-hmm.-Oh.
00:34:58.360 And connect the wire with your Nokia phoneand then while you are driving,
00:35:02.120 the speaker, you know, you can talk.
00:35:04.960 A pretty interesting solution.
00:35:06.240 They had a speakeryou can put in your seat
00:35:09.200 and the mic and, you know,the speakers will come like this.
00:35:13.960 So all those sort of...
00:35:16.240 So I said, "No, we are not interestedin the accessories business."
00:35:20.200 So the technology was there with uscompletely because we developed...
00:35:25.000 So we made our own box,our fixed wireless terminal.
00:35:27.760 Stamped Micromax on top of itand went back to Airtel.
00:35:31.280 We said, "Nokia is no more,this is Micromax.
00:35:34.640 Would you like to use it?"
00:35:36.840 Same terminal.
00:35:38.960 All of those guys, Airtel and Vodafone,they used to know me from Nokia.
00:35:44.200 In their phone also, my phone numberwas saved as "Rahul Nokia".
00:35:49.000 So they said, "Okay."
00:35:54.240 Up north there is a shrine, Vaishno Devi,they said, "You install it there."
00:35:58.080 Because it works 24 hours, the pay phone,you know, it works 24 hours.
00:36:03.600 -In "Vaishnav" Devi?-Vaishno Devi.
00:36:05.920 Yeah? I have been there,that walk where you are climbing the hill
00:36:09.960 and there are STD boothson that path, right?
00:36:11.840 Yes, yes.
00:36:14.400 So we installed our machines there.
00:36:17.080 First machines in Vaishno Devi?
00:36:18.720 -Yes.-How come?
00:36:20.600 Because that's what Airtel said,that, you know, if you install--
00:36:22.680 Because the traffic is so high,that if it works there,
00:36:26.360 if it can take the load,then it will work anywhere.
00:36:29.480 We said, "Okay."We installed it there, 20 days.
00:36:32.160 The revenue from...
00:36:33.240 Because see, for the operators,it was a killer product
00:36:36.400 because their ARPU from one SIM card,
00:36:38.640 multiple people are using one SIM card,the ARPU is massive.
00:36:41.960 Thousands of rupees from one SIM card.
00:36:44.040 With an individual, it's...
00:36:45.920 Versus what did they have before that?
00:36:47.600 Nothing.
00:36:49.240 There were STD booths before that, right?
00:36:50.840 MTNL... powered by MTNL and BSNL.
00:36:53.040 Hmm.
00:36:54.160 To run an...
00:36:55.440 You know, to install an STD boothwhere there was no MTNL, BSNL line,
00:36:58.200 where there was only...
00:36:59.280 if there was a GSM signal coming in,you can power that.
00:37:03.720 And so then they gave us a contract.
00:37:06.640 This is pre"people having cell phones", right?
00:37:08.640 Significantly pre.
00:37:09.840 No, cell phones were there at that time.
00:37:11.600 In 2005-06, they were pretty much there.
00:37:14.520 Yeah, the cell phones were there.
00:37:15.720 No smartphones,all the feature phones were there.
00:37:17.880 So, you are saying the difference wasit got cheaper?
00:37:20.080 Yeah, it was difficult to get.
00:37:22.400 So, you have to apply to MTNL,get a license and then, you know, install.
00:37:26.640 -Painful that time.-[Rahul] Right.
00:37:28.520 The government.
00:37:29.680 The government thing and then,you know, they will come,
00:37:32.640 and if there was no line...
00:37:34.520 Imagine if there is no...If it is a village.
00:37:37.800 See, they have to lay down the whole line.It was a costly affair and time-taking.
00:37:41.520 And for us, if there is a signal coming,
00:37:43.320 we will say, about five minutes,we will install it.
00:37:45.853 So, that business started doing quite welland then we became a de facto number one
00:37:50.693 on GSM fixed wireless terminal phonesin India.
00:37:53.693 And started operating offices pan-India,became a pan-India player,
00:37:59.173 service network and everything.So, we learnt a lot there.
00:38:02.533 Applying, you know, sale tax numbersand everything,
00:38:05.653 you know, like the whole...how the business works.
00:38:08.653 This is till 2006.
00:38:10.933 2000, yeah. 2006-07.
00:38:14.053 Mm.
00:38:15.573 One fine day, I got a callfrom a senior guy from Airtel.
00:38:17.653 He said, "Oh, there is a problemin a machine.
00:38:19.133 Can you go and check it?"
00:38:20.533 That, by that time, you know,our business grew
00:38:22.453 to like 400 crores per annum.
00:38:25.013 So, we were doing, like...
00:38:28.853 Did you have liquidity?Did you take out money from the business?
00:38:31.653 No, we were just keeping the money.
00:38:33.373 But I still... I just rememberthat time BMW came to India.
00:38:36.053 I bought a BMW 3 Seriesand thought, "Yes, this is it."
00:38:39.893 In 2006.
00:38:41.013 So, that time, then my...That was the first time
00:38:43.893 when my parents realisedthat our son is doing something.
00:38:46.293 Because otherwise, they used to ask me,"Son, what are you doing?"
00:38:49.173 I said, "Fixed wireless terminalsand all that..."
00:38:52.053 Yeah, so coming back to the story,so that guy called me.
00:38:54.893 So, I said, he said,"It's in Bengal somewhere,
00:38:58.173 why don't you go and check?"
00:38:59.933 I said, "I'll send some engineer."
00:39:01.493 He said,"No, it's a senior-level escalation,
00:39:02.933 can you go yourself?" I said, "Okay."
00:39:05.733 Took a plane, landed in Kolkata,took a cab,
00:39:08.253 five hours drive near Bangladesh border.
00:39:11.653 Saw, this all, Krishnanagar,Nadia and all...
00:39:16.973 Just saw the problem, fixed itand then in the evening coming back...
00:39:20.613 to catch a flightin late night in Kolkata.
00:39:23.093 In mid, I saw, it's a villagewhere there was no electricity.
00:39:26.573 But there was an Airtel ISD PCO booth.
00:39:31.293 So, I asked my cab driver, I said,"Bhaiya, can you stop the car?"
00:39:35.453 I went inside the booth.
00:39:38.213 And, because I knewthat if it is an Airtel,
00:39:39.853 must be using our equipment.
00:39:41.453 So, I said, "There is no electricityin the village,
00:39:45.013 how are you running this booth?"
00:39:48.413 He showed me a big truck battery there.
00:39:50.373 He said, "Sir, you draw power from here."
00:39:54.253 I said, "Fine."
00:39:56.733 We were not making phones those days,I was having a Nokia phone.
00:40:00.613 There was no signal in my phone.
00:40:01.893 I said, "There is no signal in my phone,how are you drawing the signals?"
00:40:05.213 He showed me a big 20 dB gain antenna,mounted on a pole on his terrace.
00:40:10.893 Typical Indian jugaad.
00:40:13.373 He said,"Sir, the signal comes from here."
00:40:16.453 I got more intrigued. I said, "Fine,
00:40:18.133 there is no electricity,how do you charge the battery?"
00:40:21.013 He said, "Eleven kilometres awaythere is a village,
00:40:24.053 there is electricity.
00:40:26.453 In the night, when I shut downmy shutter, I go there,
00:40:28.973 charge in the nightand then come back in the morning."
00:40:31.613 I said, "How much money do you make?"
00:40:33.613 He said, "Around, let's say,4,000 rupees a month."
00:40:36.453 Now, 4,000 rupees a month in a village,
00:40:38.413 there is no electricity,no entertainment, no TV, is big.
00:40:42.053 Then I was travellingin the interiors of Bihar,
00:40:45.733 and I saw people charging,
00:40:48.093 you know, asking 25 rupees or 40 rupeesto charge your phone.
00:40:52.693 Because at those days there weredifferent pins for different phones.
00:40:55.173 I remember, yeah.
00:40:56.933 Different for Motorolaand different for Nokia,
00:41:00.093 those round pins and all...
00:41:01.813 before everything standardised.
00:41:03.853 I said, "Why is this?"
00:41:05.333 He said, "Because there is no electricityat home, people come, pay and charge."
00:41:08.893 It's very expensive, right?
00:41:10.933 -For a charge.-Yeah. At that time it is very much.
00:41:13.893 But see, those daysmobile phones were not common like this
00:41:16.693 because the call was not free.
00:41:20.053 Today, probably you are paying for data.
00:41:22.053 You know, that time the callwas expensive.
00:41:24.973 I went back, sat with our guys,worked a lot on the GSM technology.
00:41:30.133 I said, "Guys,why don't you make a mobile phone?"
00:41:31.853 What year was this?
00:41:33.093 This is 2007.
00:41:36.253 So, the first reaction from everyoneinternally was, "Are you crazy?
00:41:39.933 Who is going to fight these Nokiasand Samsungs and Motorolas in the world?"
00:41:47.453 And they said,"Why do you want to do that?
00:41:49.213 I mean, we are doing so well.You are driving a BMW 3 Series,
00:41:53.013 so why do you wantto disturb the apple cart?
00:41:55.573 Why?
00:41:57.973 I said, "No, I think, you know, the foodis being cooked in different countries.
00:42:03.653 We need a flavour in India.
00:42:05.453 You know, it's somewhere in Finlandor in Korea, but we need Indian flavours."
00:42:13.213 Anyway, so fought a lot internally.
00:42:16.093 And then they said...
00:42:17.533 Fought with your co-founders,your partners.
00:42:18.973 Yes, yes, yes.
00:42:21.053 They said, "Okay, 10,000 phones you make.
00:42:23.533 If it works, it's fine,otherwise our business is doing well."
00:42:26.013 So, this is like casino moneythey gave me.
00:42:28.093 They said, "You go and play, if it works,it's okay. Otherwise you pay."
00:42:30.373 How much money was there?
00:42:32.133 10,000 phones,even if a phone was 2,000 rupees,
00:42:36.493 you multiply, it was what?
00:42:38.653 -Twenty crores?-Yeah, all that, yeah.
00:42:43.013 I said, okay.
00:42:44.973 So, we sat with the team and said,
00:42:46.493 "Guys, let's make a phonewith long battery life,
00:42:48.853 one month of battery backup,because of all these experiences."
00:42:52.653 And...
00:42:54.813 And that's howthe first Micromax phone came.
00:42:58.013 And the tagline for the phonewas "Mobile ka Baap."
00:43:00.733 Because the standby time was 30 days.
00:43:04.093 Since we worked a lot.
00:43:05.693 Now, herein, my philosophy is thatwhatever you are doing in life,
00:43:10.093 nothing goes waste.
00:43:11.373 Whatever we were, you know, I'm just,you know, scrambling my whole story here.
00:43:15.413 But in between,we worked a lot on SIM card,
00:43:17.293 with Schlumberger and all those guysfor one, two years.
00:43:19.253 Nothing came out of it.
00:43:20.893 Nothing came out of all those things.
00:43:22.773 But all those things we implementedwhen we were making phones.
00:43:26.573 So, normal phones takeseven to eight milliamperes,
00:43:30.373 you know, per second as power.
00:43:32.693 We worked on embedded,
00:43:34.413 we made it two to three milliamperesper second.
00:43:36.533 And that's how we createdthe same form factor.
00:43:40.253 At that time,the battery was 700, 600 mAh.
00:43:44.573 We put some 1,800 mAh,2,000 mAh that time.
00:43:48.493 Same form factor.
00:43:49.773 Made a phoneand then went to the distributors.
00:43:53.093 Now, the real problem started from there.
00:43:56.173 Because all the distributors were like,all big distributors.
00:43:59.133 Like, even the Delhi distributor of Nokiawas bigger than us.
00:44:04.413 We were doing pan-India business,fixed wireless and all, but...
00:44:07.333 Because Nokia was so successful.
00:44:09.373 So, we said, "Now we make mobile phones,why don't you distribute?"
00:44:13.493 And globally, it was only, you know,
00:44:14.933 all those four, fiveinternational brand names.
00:44:18.373 There was no local brand doing anythingin the world at that time.
00:44:23.173 Even if it was there, they were not likevery, very successful brands.
00:44:27.013 So, they just offered us a cup of coffeeand said, "Good friends, but sorry."
00:44:32.013 We were not able to find a distributorafter making the phone.
00:44:35.333 In 2000?
00:44:37.693 '07, '08 now. This is '08.
00:44:42.173 And so, we went back to...
00:44:44.693 After a lot of...there is no distributor, how do we...
00:44:48.013 So, we went back to our fixed wireless.
00:44:49.813 -Did you already make the inventory?-Huh?
00:44:51.533 -Did you already make the inventory?-Yeah, already it was with us.
00:44:55.733 And we went back to our distributorsof fixed wireless terminals,
00:44:59.893 payphone guys, who were selling payphones.
00:45:03.293 We said, "Now, we have this.Would you like to sell this?"
00:45:06.173 He said, "Sir, give it to us, keep it,if it sells, we will see."
00:45:09.013 Because they were notthe mobile phone guys.
00:45:12.333 We gave the phones to them.
00:45:16.013 Ten days, the phones were sold out.
00:45:19.653 Why? Because of the differentiation.There was nothing like that in the market.
00:45:22.613 -Battery was the differentiation.-Yes.
00:45:25.333 Which you learnt from travellingto remote places.
00:45:27.493 Yes.
00:45:29.173 And the form factor was nice,it was not bulky,
00:45:32.973 so we didn't try to change muchon the form factor and all.
00:45:38.533 The repeat order started coming in.That's the same--
00:45:41.973 And then everything went crazy.Things blew up, right?
00:45:44.533 -Things blew up.-I remember seeing Micromax everywhere.
00:45:47.133 Yeah, then things became crazy.
00:45:49.133 And you started marketing like madat this point, right?
00:45:52.013 No, so then we sat and said,"Okay, what is it that we want to do?
00:45:56.373 And how do we want to do it?"
00:45:58.373 Because there could bea lot of distractions.
00:46:02.053 So, and we were still learningat that stage,
00:46:05.213 it's not that we perfected,we were still learning.
00:46:08.813 So, one day I saw my cookusing three SIM cards.
00:46:12.613 This is the timewhen all the new operators got license,
00:46:16.133 and everybody was sellingnew schemes every day.
00:46:18.133 Uninor and all the new guys came in.
00:46:21.293 So, I said,"Why are you using three SIM cards?"
00:46:22.973 He said, "Sir, one for local calling."
00:46:25.293 I said, "Fine. Second SIM card?"
00:46:27.213 He said, "To call my native village."
00:46:29.613 I said, "Third SIM card?"
00:46:31.733 He said, "Incoming is free,so I am not throwing it away."
00:46:35.973 I went back to our guys and said,
00:46:37.453 "Guys, why don't we make a phonewith a dual SIM card?"
00:46:41.213 They said, "No, two phonesonly rich people can afford."
00:46:44.573 I said, "That's not the consumer truth.
00:46:46.293 These are the guyswho are using two phones.
00:46:49.453 So, can we makein a single phone, you know,
00:46:51.853 simultaneously talking on the GSM signal?"
00:46:55.453 So, with one single baseband,we created the dual SIM phone that time.
00:46:59.853 And I still remember,I showcased it at one distributor meet,
00:47:04.533 and everybody stoodand clapped, and they said, "Sir..."
00:47:08.213 That was the time when we realised
00:47:10.093 that we have to find the gapsin the market.
00:47:14.653 It's very interesting.You are finding your gaps
00:47:16.653 from your driver, your maid,from going to villages.
00:47:20.053 Everyday life.
00:47:21.373 It's like you are learning that,
00:47:23.373 you are just observingand then, you know, finding those gaps.
00:47:26.333 Do you see any gaps today?
00:47:28.413 Multiple.
00:47:29.493 Name one, top of the list.
00:47:34.093 I can go on and on,
00:47:35.733 but these are all different,different ideas.
00:47:38.773 I went crazy, I will tell you, you know,in that in terms of finding gaps.
00:47:41.253 So, we said, okay, we want to make a...
00:47:42.733 So, that's how we made first phonefor girls with Swarovski.
00:47:46.053 At that time,the phones for girls in India
00:47:48.173 was only by Dolce & Gabbana, by Motorola.
00:47:50.533 Now, how many people can afforda Dolce & Gabbana in this country?
00:47:54.413 So, we made a phone,you know, with Swarovski.
00:47:57.773 Now, again, these very interestingconsumer stories here.
00:48:00.373 We launched that phonebecause our team insisted,
00:48:03.293 "No, this is Swarovski,it has to be expensive."
00:48:06.493 And after a lot of, you know...
00:48:10.053 I said, "No, just make it in the reach of,
00:48:14.413 let's say, common people."
00:48:15.733 We priced at 5,000 rupees at that time.
00:48:18.333 Is that the way in India?
00:48:19.813 I remember watching an interview of yourswhen I was researching for today.
00:48:25.293 When you were talkingabout the form factor on your phone,
00:48:27.933 you said-- What was his name?
00:48:30.613 -Jesper?-[Carl] Yeah.
00:48:32.493 He said that wheneveryou look a product...
00:48:35.013 at a product for two secondsand look away and you have to draw it,
00:48:39.333 you should havethat one distinctive design element.
00:48:43.293 That's a very different school of thought
00:48:46.133 from the more utilitarian schoolof thought here, right?
00:48:49.973 Is this what works for Indiaand that works for the affluent?
00:48:55.053 No, see, this is a timewhen there were only feature phones,
00:48:57.413 -there were no smartphones.-[Nikhil] Right.
00:48:58.893 So, how do you differentiatefeature phones?
00:49:00.413 Right.
00:49:01.533 I think we're at a stage in the industrywhere it's hyper-competitive.
00:49:04.733 -Yes.-Every user need has been fully explored.
00:49:08.293 Now, it is all evolved, like in laptops,it's already at the ceiling.
00:49:12.453 -How will you... You can't reinvent.-Right.
00:49:16.013 This was a timewhen everything was evolving.
00:49:17.973 [Nikhil] Right.
00:49:19.093 We're at a different maturity stageof the industry, I think.
00:49:21.493 -[Rahul] Yes, yes.-Right. Right.
00:49:23.293 The phone was also a dreamwhen you came in.
00:49:26.813 Nobody had phones that time.
00:49:28.013 2008, by then, a lot of people had phones.
00:49:31.893 Yeah, but the penetration was not high
00:49:33.373 because the GSM ratesand everything was quite expensive.
00:49:36.773 How big did it get in terms of numbers?
00:49:39.413 From selling 10,000 phones a month,
00:49:43.493 we were selling three million phonesa month.
00:49:47.293 How big was the overall marketat that time?
00:49:50.013 Total market less than 100 millionin India.
00:49:52.893 Put together, less than that.
00:49:54.653 So, you were selling3% of the total market a month.
00:49:58.853 -No, no, no.-[Amit] 20%?
00:50:00.533 [Rahul] No, no, no.
00:50:02.013 -[Carl] A third?-No, no, no.
00:50:04.533 When we were doing three million,
00:50:06.933 at that time, our market sharewas around 25%, plus, plus.
00:50:11.653 That's crazy.
00:50:13.013 You were sponsoring cricket,
00:50:15.013 you were sponsoring everythingback then, right?
00:50:17.253 Yes, so our big betwas on cricket and music.
00:50:21.173 Because that's what the youth was into.
00:50:22.693 And you said, a blanket on whatever is...
00:50:27.253 Yeah. And that worked also.
00:50:29.693 -And this stayed for a while?-Yeah.
00:50:32.493 For a couple of years?
00:50:34.373 -Yeah.-This crazy growth trajectory?
00:50:36.453 Yes.
00:50:37.693 Interestingly, we come backto our tariff questions,
00:50:41.253 the tariff conversationwe were having earlier,
00:50:43.493 because that kind ofwas the problem, right?
00:50:46.853 The Chinese competitionwhich came into India post.
00:50:49.693 Yes, so that was a time...
00:50:52.933 And again, I will answer a coupleof other questions
00:50:54.893 which you were asking aboutwhy you wanted to and all.
00:50:57.693 So there were a lot of learnings alsoin between.
00:50:59.733 So for example, when Meizuwas raising the round with Alibaba,
00:51:04.173 we were deep downwith Alibaba at that time.
00:51:06.573 Yeah. Raising the round and...
00:51:08.333 -So our paths have been intertwined.-Yes, and a pretty big one.
00:51:12.133 At that time, we were raising, what,
00:51:14.253 around 800 million dollarsaround at that time.
00:51:16.333 This is in 2000...
00:51:17.493 '14 and secondary, most of it.
00:51:20.933 -Wow!-[laughter]
00:51:24.173 So it was because the businesswas throwing so much of cash.
00:51:28.133 -Right.-Yeah, so we said we don't need money,
00:51:30.373 but, you know, at that time,everybody wanted to connect.
00:51:33.053 -You know, I remember...-You could buy a few more BMWs.
00:51:37.093 Few more than few more.
00:51:38.253 [laughter]
00:51:40.133 So this was going well.And then we realised that...
00:51:43.853 So we didn't take that money.
00:51:45.133 We said, "Okay, no,we are doing quite well."
00:51:46.653 We said, "We already have so much of..."
00:51:49.973 Bad decision in hindsight?
00:51:51.653 So we thought that, you know,
00:51:53.773 if we have taken care of the Finnishand the Koreans at that time--
00:51:58.893 Later on, because that time we never knew,
00:52:00.653 but in 2016-17, you know,that was the time
00:52:05.133 when the, you know, the Chinese brandsstarted coming in.
00:52:09.213 So we thought, you know,we have taken care of them.
00:52:11.613 So we can, you know,we'll take care of this also.
00:52:14.413 It's okay. We'll go head on.
00:52:17.853 But, you know, that wasa very, very different game.
00:52:22.093 Because, you know, when the Chinese came,they came up with so much of gunpowder.
00:52:26.853 And you never know thatwhere the gunpowder is coming from.
00:52:29.533 And whether there is an end to it or not.
00:52:32.653 Do you think the governmentsubsidised them to come in that manner?
00:52:35.813 -Their government?-[Rahul] So... Yes.
00:52:37.493 So there, as I said,you never know, because, you know,
00:52:39.453 there were so many schemeswhich were running there.
00:52:42.053 And not only the central level scheme,but also the state level scheme.
00:52:44.773 The companies were fundedby the states also.
00:52:47.893 So...
00:52:49.773 So we said, okay, we'll see.
00:52:51.933 And then we started fighting.
00:52:53.493 It was a price, you know,price battle started going on.
00:52:57.573 You know, when the Xiaomis of the worldstarted coming in and then the...
00:53:00.573 So before that, we were fighting,let's say, with the Samsungs
00:53:03.613 and the Motosor the Sony Ericssons of the world.
00:53:09.093 Doing pretty well.
00:53:10.853 And then you start...suddenly you start having a competition
00:53:13.493 wherein if you are selling, let's say,at 100 rupees,
00:53:17.773 somebody comes and says,hey, I'm 90 rupees.
00:53:21.333 [Nikhil] And if you say 80,they'll say 70.
00:53:23.093 [Rahul] They'll say 70.So that's how it's a race to the bottom.
00:53:25.493 And then suddenlythey were burning a lot of money.
00:53:29.533 -But can I ask a structural question?-Yes. Yes.
00:53:32.733 While it seems like a race to the bottom,
00:53:36.173 because of the scale of manufacturingthey have,
00:53:39.893 is the cost of production in Chinainherently so much lower
00:53:45.213 that at 80 rupees you can't make money,but at 70 rupees they can?
00:53:49.213 So that's, yeah, that's true,because it's the whole supply chain
00:53:53.573 which is, you know,which is established there.
00:53:56.333 So probably what we were discussing.
00:53:58.293 That if their BOM is 100, your BOM is 120.
00:54:03.173 But you would also be importingthat time or manufacturing?
00:54:06.813 No. So, see, we establishedour first plant in India in 2010.
00:54:11.213 -So you started early.-Way before Make In India started.
00:54:14.453 So, but the componentswas coming from there, right?
00:54:18.053 And at that time, all these brandswhat we see right now,
00:54:21.493 they were not there.
00:54:22.733 So they started coming in, for example,all the brands were there in DVD players
00:54:27.693 or MP3 players, and then they startedcoming on that.
00:54:31.933 And then the price war started.
00:54:33.773 And so, and we also went into it.
00:54:39.293 But somehow with the whole supply chainand everything, then you slowly,
00:54:42.813 you know, access to all these thingsstarted getting restricted.
00:54:46.933 So, for example,why Micromax became successful?
00:54:49.453 Because in this...in the industry where we are in,
00:54:52.373 you are already, you know,you're looking for a differentiation.
00:54:54.293 For example, if I was designing a phone,my question to myself was:
00:54:56.973 Why will I buy,or somebody will buy this phone?
00:54:59.133 What is different in this one? Why?
00:55:01.333 Why...
00:55:02.693 Why somebody will not buy another phone?
00:55:04.493 So, you know, that's howthe differentiators were coming in.
00:55:08.093 And differentiatorwas not only on the feature,
00:55:10.213 but also on who's going to come upwith the latest chipset first.
00:55:13.733 Who's going to come up with--If there is a 50 megapixel camera,
00:55:15.733 who's the first guy coming upwith a 50 megapixel camera?
00:55:18.853 If there was a fast charging coming,
00:55:20.773 who's the first guyto come up with fast charging?
00:55:22.453 And the distributors used to look at,you know, look at us that,
00:55:25.453 okay, they will come upwith something new every quarter and...
00:55:29.933 So when that accessstarted getting stopped?
00:55:32.013 Government stopped the access?
00:55:33.813 No, no, it's not the government, you know,because the scale shifted somewhere else.
00:55:38.133 Right.
00:55:39.213 And they preferred supplyingto their own companies than to you?
00:55:42.973 Right. And so the numbers and everything,
00:55:48.253 because their numbersstarted growing up in...
00:55:50.053 Because China itselfbecame a very big market
00:55:52.013 and the scale was, you know, became big.
00:55:53.973 Because, you know,there are a lot of theories about...
00:55:56.173 about Micromax in the market.
00:55:57.813 This happened, that happened.Everybody can come up with their own.
00:56:00.773 Yeah. What is the theory...the most popular one?
00:56:02.933 No, I keep on hearing different one.
00:56:04.493 Oh, they went, you know,into luxury segment
00:56:07.853 or there was no R&D. You know, all this.
00:56:11.573 But I don't knowhow many people know, we...
00:56:13.293 When Nokia got sold, we had the...
00:56:15.653 You know, we took all the top Nokia,they had the gold, you know, division.
00:56:20.213 We got all gold guys from Nokiaand doing the R&D at that time.
00:56:23.213 But whatever this was happening,all this, you know, coming from China,
00:56:27.333 it was a global phenomenon.
00:56:28.613 So it was not only that we were affected.
00:56:30.733 All the other, let's say,there were other brands
00:56:32.733 in Turkey or in Malaysia,
00:56:37.733 other places,you know, everybody got affected.
00:56:40.813 And I think in 2019 odd or so,we realised that, you know,
00:56:47.493 you can burn money,but you know, you can burn money
00:56:50.013 till the point you knowthat I'm going to win the game.
00:56:52.293 Right.
00:56:53.373 But if the other person is havingan unlimited supplies,
00:56:57.493 like a bottomless pit.
00:56:59.173 A bit like today, no?All the loss-making startups in India,
00:57:03.533 all competing downwards.
00:57:05.453 Yeah.
00:57:07.333 And see, and we build Micromax,let's say, from day one, making money
00:57:11.853 and doing that, you know,never raised any capital.
00:57:15.893 Slowly, slowly, you know, build itand whatever, you know, we raised.
00:57:19.493 Said no to $800 million in 2014.
00:57:22.813 -So if you ask me in hindsight that.-You should have taken it.
00:57:26.573 Yeah, because see, that time we never knewthat you had to create a war chest.
00:57:29.413 [Nikhil] Yeah.
00:57:31.413 You create a war chestand say, "Okay, now let's, you know--"
00:57:34.013 Biggest bull run in Indian equity markets.Imagine you put that in equity.
00:57:38.013 2014 to today.
00:57:39.573 Yeah. So, you know, with $800 million,
00:57:41.253 you sit on the casino tableand say, okay, now play.
00:57:43.133 -Yeah.-[Carl] Yeah.
00:57:45.933 Yeah, so, and then after...
00:57:48.533 Yeah, in 2009,then we realised that, you know,
00:57:50.813 either we'll, you know,if we keep on burning with this space,
00:57:53.693 we will get finished.
00:57:55.093 We'll get completely burned out.
00:57:56.533 We will not have any capital left.
00:57:59.253 So we said,"Okay, let's stop burning money.
00:58:01.973 And wait for your turn.
00:58:04.933 And start focusing on manufacturing."
00:58:07.693 And that's howwe started building more factories
00:58:11.813 in 19, 20, 21, and now.
00:58:17.493 And that's how we, you know,pivoted on the manufacturing game.
00:58:22.213 And the whole idea is that unlessand until you have access to supply chain.
00:58:26.613 For example, if today I have to makea triple screen fold...
00:58:33.573 I don't have access to the screen.
00:58:36.013 So how do you come up with the latest?
00:58:37.253 -When you say access to supply chain...-Yes.
00:58:39.733 ...you're talking aboutthe company in China that gives--
00:58:42.453 That makes the screen. Okay?
00:58:43.933 That makes the display.
00:58:45.173 But the other bigger company there,
00:58:47.053 for example, let's say Huawei,has a triple screen.
00:58:49.013 Huawei has already blocked that
00:58:50.093 and said, "Okay, for one yearyou can't give to anybody else.
00:58:52.613 Because I am promising youthis much of volume."
00:58:55.013 So, Nikhil,how it happens is all partners,
00:58:58.973 like supply chain partners,screen, battery, or processor,
00:59:02.533 they work with bigger brands,
00:59:04.013 and everybody has an alpha customeron their list.
00:59:06.293 Let's say Huawei would bethe alpha customer on the list.
00:59:09.133 So every first technologywould go to Huawei.
00:59:12.213 He will block the capacity,and when it is over, it will come to us.
00:59:15.813 New technology means all resourcesthey will depute to Huawei.
00:59:19.013 And then it will come to the market,
00:59:20.413 and Huawei will take the first legof new product, which is launching,
00:59:24.253 which goes for chipsets,screens, sensor, across.
00:59:28.013 But we will never be able to make thaton our own.
00:59:30.733 For anybody wanting to starta consumer electronic company,
00:59:35.493 you can't make that triple-fold screen
00:59:37.733 that this supply chain vendoris making for Huawei.
00:59:41.573 No, if you are, like, a "startup" startup,it is too hard to make.
00:59:45.533 It requires a lot of money and probably--
00:59:47.173 [Amit] He might be making it.
00:59:48.813 -It's at a later stage.-He can answer.
00:59:49.973 -Yes, later stage.-It's at a later stage.
00:59:51.813 So if you look at Apple's strategy now,
00:59:53.933 they feel like they're bleedingtoo much margin to their suppliers.
00:59:57.013 -[Amit] Yeah.-So they're doing vertical integration.
00:59:58.853 So they are developingtheir own technology,
01:00:00.853 their own screen,their own whatever processor.
01:00:02.773 I thought they're outsourcing moreto Foxconn and--
01:00:05.693 -For manufacturing.-It's only for EMS.
01:00:07.573 -What is EMS?-Assembling.
01:00:09.413 -You would attempt better.-Just for assembling?
01:00:12.213 -Really?-[Rahul] Yes.
01:00:13.453 So Apple used to bea consumer-focused company, right?
01:00:16.253 So in the start, they were very small.
01:00:18.373 They were competing against IBM,and, like, big PC companies.
01:00:21.893 So they targeted a niche consumer,the creative consumer.
01:00:25.613 And they positioned the personal computeras a bicycle for the mind.
01:00:28.653 So if you have an idea,
01:00:29.733 you can use your Apple computerto manifest that idea.
01:00:32.973 In the '90s,they started acquiring software companies
01:00:36.133 to then create their own suiteof content creation tools
01:00:38.693 like iMovie, GarageBand.
01:00:41.373 It's all to cater to the creative, right?
01:00:42.973 Beautiful industrial design,
01:00:44.493 great software that helps youtake your ideas into reality.
01:00:48.653 After some time,they really captured the creatives.
01:00:51.573 -Like, they had a partnership with Adobe.-Yeah.
01:00:54.733 Adobe worked better on Apple computers.
01:00:57.413 So once they got the creatives,the brand became really cool.
01:01:00.573 So normal people,they also wanted to feel creative.
01:01:03.653 So therefore,"I buy Apples 'cause I'm a creative."
01:01:06.933 But then...
01:01:08.253 So they won the consumer battle.
01:01:09.693 And then to keep growing the share price,
01:01:12.653 they needed to take the valueback from their suppliers
01:01:14.933 'cause they had outsourceda lot of the components.
01:01:18.013 So in the recent ten years,it's been a vertical integration strategy.
01:01:21.813 Now they do their own processors.
01:01:23.173 Actually, what we talked about before,they get the TSMC latest...
01:01:27.573 There you need allocation.
01:01:28.893 Yeah, they get the first batchbefore everybody else.
01:01:31.733 They get the latest technology from TSMCfor Apple silicon.
01:01:35.293 Now they're doing a mini...Is it mini-LED or micro-LED?
01:01:38.493 They have their own display technology.
01:01:41.253 It's deployed on the Apple Watch already.
01:01:42.893 The mini-LED.
01:01:44.413 [Carl] Mini-LED.
01:01:45.493 So it's very hardfor anyone to compete, right?
01:01:47.653 It's a very tough industry.
01:01:50.133 And everybody who is an incumbent todayhas been around for 30, 40, 50, 100 years?
01:01:57.213 Apple is, like, 50, I think. 50-ish.
01:02:00.133 -Samsung is older.-Yeah.
01:02:02.533 But Samsung's smartphone businessshould be similar, maybe 25 years.
01:02:07.453 The Chinese brand, maybe 15 years.
01:02:10.053 So every ten years, the cards will flip.
01:02:14.733 [Rahul] Yeah, so I thinkthis is a very interesting thing...
01:02:18.493 if you're talking about competing,or nobody can come up.
01:02:22.493 -We came up at that time.-[Nikhil] Yeah.
01:02:24.173 Defying the odds, you know.
01:02:25.413 Globally there was, you know, no brand,like a local brand who came and became...
01:02:31.053 Like, we were top ten in the world,and that's how it was going.
01:02:35.413 I still feel that can happen. Right?
01:02:39.013 But we never realised that governmentshave to, you know, play a role in it.
01:02:44.973 Because at that time we never thoughtabout the governments and the countries.
01:02:47.653 Now we realise about countries,governments, and everything.
01:02:50.493 -What should the government do?-Yeah.
01:02:52.893 For example,you take our automobile industry in India.
01:02:57.613 I think we have done a great job there.
01:02:59.693 All the Hondas and Suzukis came initially,
01:03:02.893 did joint ventureswith the Indian companies.
01:03:06.493 Created a lot of ecosystemof supply chain.
01:03:09.373 -You see all the component players.-Yeah.
01:03:12.013 Right?
01:03:13.093 And now if you seeour automobile industry,
01:03:15.293 we are supplying to the world now.
01:03:17.773 We are a very mature industryin automobile.
01:03:19.693 And if the same thing were truefor mobile phones,
01:03:21.893 what happened to Micromaxwould not have happened.
01:03:24.653 Maybe, you know,the world order would have been different
01:03:27.653 in terms of the brands.
01:03:28.893 -Right.-Yeah.
01:03:30.053 So, any industry, you need to seethat you want to make local champions.
01:03:33.693 So for example,today in the worldly order,
01:03:36.533 imagine if there are two, threelocal champions coming out of India
01:03:41.733 who can make a global impact.
01:03:43.653 I think it would be great for the country.
01:03:45.013 [Nikhil] But if we...
01:03:46.333 There's a flip side to that argument
01:03:47.653 that if we become protectionistof local industry...
01:03:51.333 do we continue to get foreign moneyinto the country?
01:03:55.933 So I'm not saying that you stop.
01:03:58.013 I'm saying you allow collaborations.
01:04:01.613 Collaborations where you need to learn.
01:04:03.933 -Collaborations with technology transfer.-[Rahul] Absolutely.
01:04:06.053 -IP transfer.-Yes.
01:04:07.533 Work on IP transfer, and then you learn.
01:04:09.613 So in four, five years, you will learn.
01:04:12.973 Right? See, I said,"Auto happened, you know, at that time."
01:04:15.533 Now today you have all the local companiesruling the roost.
01:04:18.853 Similarly, you learn here,five years, six years.
01:04:21.493 So, a lot of people ask me,"Okay, can you do this?
01:04:24.053 Can you make a, you know,very complex phone?"
01:04:26.413 We said,"Yes, we can make a very complex phone.
01:04:28.253 But maybe it will take five years,six years in India to do that.
01:04:31.413 But with collaboration,I can start learning right away.
01:04:34.093 And then can do it very, very quickly."
01:04:36.053 And how much did this three million phonesa number fall to
01:04:40.253 when things went bad at Micromax?
01:04:42.013 No, no, it totally started coming.
01:04:43.213 Every year it started coming up,we started losing.
01:04:45.373 At that time,
01:04:46.493 all the Indian brands were more than 50%of the Indian market share.
01:04:49.533 -Right. Right.-Which completely got decimated.
01:04:52.373 What was the low for Micromaxas a company?
01:04:54.893 Which year was the low?
01:04:56.573 I think that time in 2019, 2020,in terms of the brand--
01:05:03.213 -Just before COVID.-Yeah.
01:05:04.813 -We said, "Okay, no more..."-And then COVID could not have been fun.
01:05:07.253 [laughter]
01:05:09.853 -Right?-Yeah.
01:05:12.533 When you go from a peak to a low,what is the one lesson that we can learn
01:05:17.653 from your experiencethat you have learnt already?
01:05:20.213 Today, our manufacturing is bigger than,you know,
01:05:22.573 the revenue is way more biggerthan what we used to do in our brand.
01:05:25.573 Which probablynot most of the people will know.
01:05:28.133 But we are doing way more betterthan what we used to do earlier.
01:05:31.293 No, I know the Micromax comebacks.
01:05:32.613 No, I know. But I am coming.
01:05:34.413 So, in between, you know,you are trying multiple things.
01:05:38.293 I think what has worked for us,you know, we later realised that,
01:05:41.653 stick to your core.
01:05:43.173 What did you realise is your core?
01:05:44.933 So my core was to remain with tech.
01:05:47.813 So, for example,I'll not start a real estate company.
01:05:49.733 Real estate is doing good, go there.
01:05:51.453 Or something else is doing good, go there.
01:05:53.053 Or something.
01:05:54.293 So this thing was already there.
01:05:56.653 The whole manufacturing,the factories what we created,
01:05:58.853 you know, for Micromax, was already there.
01:06:00.453 So why don't we build on that?
01:06:06.253 And start doing for others.
01:06:08.413 That helped, and that's how we...
01:06:10.173 So at Micromax time,
01:06:11.373 we were having probablyone or two factories.
01:06:13.573 Now, we have four large factories,fifth coming up, and then--
01:06:18.133 You just acquired a new factory as well.
01:06:19.973 And now you are scaling.
01:06:22.973 Do you feel like you are strongerthe second time around
01:06:25.613 than you were in the beginning?
01:06:27.933 Less oblivious, more aware.
01:06:31.693 Like, I feel likeonce somebody is scarred,
01:06:35.013 the next time they're a little bitmore differentiated in their approach.
01:06:39.493 This weekend I was thinking that.
01:06:41.893 -Believe me.-In Goa?
01:06:43.413 Yeah. [chuckles]
01:06:45.533 I was thinking about that.
01:06:47.493 About something I used to do earlier.
01:06:50.693 And then I again thought,"I am still doing the same thing."
01:06:53.973 Which is?
01:06:55.133 Taking big bets, going risky, and all.
01:06:58.493 Like, you know, once you start doing,I said, "Okay, no, no, no more, no more.
01:07:03.493 Stick, stick to your, you know..."
01:07:05.693 -But---Risk is intoxicating, no?
01:07:08.413 It is.
01:07:09.533 While you are taking it?
01:07:10.813 Yeah.
01:07:11.933 -It gives you a high?-Yeah.
01:07:14.613 And believe that, "Okay, no, no, no,
01:07:15.813 this is something I think you can do,you can crack it."
01:07:19.093 And then you go for it.
01:07:21.293 And because it has worked earlier,then you start thinking.
01:07:23.533 Then you know every timeit is going to work,
01:07:25.213 which is not the case.
01:07:28.693 So, yes, while, you know,we are doing this, I am more aware.
01:07:32.373 But the core is that, nah?
01:07:34.773 So once your core is that,you will want to take bigger bets,
01:07:40.013 thinking that,"Okay, nothing happened earlier.
01:07:42.773 You know, you came out of it, see?"
01:07:46.413 So I think that's the DNA.
01:07:47.853 As long as the bets don't go wrong,they always get bigger,
01:07:51.093 -organically.-Yeah.
01:07:52.573 If you had to bet moneyon some entrepreneur today,
01:07:57.333 wouldn't you pick somebodywho has screwed up a couple of times
01:08:00.013 versus somebodywho is doing it for the first time?
01:08:04.173 Screwed up a couple of times,but eventually made it.
01:08:06.453 -Yeah, that is important.-[Nikhil] Yeah.
01:08:08.493 Yeah.
01:08:09.893 If eventually made it,then, yeah, that's fine.
01:08:12.413 I feel like this prophecy is truefor all life.
01:08:16.613 I like peoplewho are a little bit screwed up
01:08:20.332 in all domains.
01:08:22.133 When I meet a manand I don't know what his vice is,
01:08:25.013 I assume the worst.
01:08:26.813 I'd rather know, "Okay, this is my friend,he is [bleep] up like this, I am aware.
01:08:30.053 I am [bleep] up like that, he is aware."
01:08:31.973 This friendship is good.
01:08:34.212 When somebody comes to meand projects the idealistic mask,
01:08:38.212 then I worry.
01:08:40.252 Because we are all the sameat the core of it, you know.
01:08:42.533 We are all inherently flawed as people.
01:08:44.893 -100%.-[Nikhil] Yeah.
01:08:47.933 Yeah.
01:08:49.332 But thank you for that.
01:08:50.412 [laughter]
01:08:52.252 All right, Mr. Amit, you're next.
01:08:55.613 -Tell us.-I think--
01:08:57.372 I'm very interested in your story'cause both of their stories--
01:09:00.493 -Him, I know firsthand.-Yeah.
01:09:01.853 And his, I have read a bit.
01:09:03.653 But your story is not so much out there.
01:09:06.493 So I come from a small town,Bikaner, Rajasthan.
01:09:10.573 And typical middle-class family.
01:09:12.332 Father used to work with bank.
01:09:14.733 Which bank?
01:09:16.013 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur,if you would have heard of.
01:09:18.453 SBBJ.
01:09:20.053 Later on they got merged with SBI.
01:09:22.453 And Grandfather was an advocate.
01:09:24.733 So typical middle class.
01:09:27.013 And when you're in a small town,
01:09:28.493 the only dream is you become a doctoror an engineer.
01:09:32.573 But I think I was not geared up for that.
01:09:35.252 I was a very mischievous kid.
01:09:37.893 Academically not very strong.
01:09:39.693 I mean, 60, 70% scorer at that time...
01:09:42.973 where people were, I think, 80, 85, or...
01:09:46.053 I was the eldest one in the family.
01:09:50.093 No, no. He's fit.
01:09:51.653 -[Rahul] Yeah?-And he went to NIFT.
01:09:56.573 -NIFT ones are the cool ones.-Yeah.
01:09:58.893 I have some colleagues who are from there.
01:10:01.253 Sometimes, over-smart.
01:10:02.573 Right?
01:10:03.653 [laughter]
01:10:05.133 Fashion college.
01:10:06.413 Yeah, it's likewhere all the cool kids go.
01:10:08.973 So anyways--
01:10:11.013 See, his shirt hasa very differentiated colour.
01:10:15.333 It's not white, right?
01:10:17.573 [chuckles] It's not white.
01:10:18.653 [Nikhil] What colour is it?
01:10:19.733 Somewhere off-white, beige-ish.
01:10:22.253 So I went...
01:10:25.253 My parents wanted me to become a doctor.
01:10:28.293 And actually,I was pushed towards that career
01:10:31.253 because in small towns,I think those were the two choice.
01:10:34.453 And apparently went to Kota alsofor PMT preparation.
01:10:39.173 Medical test at that timefor crash course.
01:10:41.533 But eventually realisedthat I think I can't do that.
01:10:44.853 And fortunately what happened that...
01:10:46.613 My father was very, you know, boldthat he wanted to get out of Bikaner
01:10:51.373 and move to a bigger city.
01:10:52.453 And he moved to Kanpur, actually.
01:10:54.253 He got posted there.And when he moved there,
01:10:56.413 I realised that it's just not thisas a career.
01:10:59.173 There are people who are securing80%, 85% marks
01:11:02.253 and going to Delhi for B.Com.
01:11:04.333 So I realised that Mass Com is a course.
01:11:06.973 B.Com is a course.
01:11:08.293 Arts people are doing because of passion.
01:11:10.173 And well-familied, good-educated kids.
01:11:13.733 Then I realised thatmedical I don't want to do.
01:11:15.813 I enjoyed maths, physics,
01:11:17.413 those kind of subjectswhere I don't need to mug up.
01:11:20.373 And definitely a small-town kidgoing to a bigger city,
01:11:23.333 so you get a little bit buoyed awayby what's happening there.
01:11:27.493 I realised that.
01:11:28.733 Then parents said, "Do an IIT."
01:11:30.493 Then I realised it's too late for meto do an IIT now.
01:11:32.933 Otherwise you'll ask meto bunk for three years.
01:11:35.533 And I think it's '98, '99.
01:11:38.773 And eventually, after graduation,started preparing for competitive exams.
01:11:43.573 And formally landed into NIFT.
01:11:45.853 So I think NIFT Hyderabadwas a real-life learning for me.
01:11:51.893 First time hostel. Getting out of home.
01:11:54.973 And I was into fashion management,not design.
01:11:57.773 But maybe all the peers were design guys.
01:12:00.853 And again,Dad took a loan for me to go to college.
01:12:04.933 So I had always limitationthat I should not be spending more.
01:12:08.453 And then my friendshad higher pocket money.
01:12:10.493 So I think my entrepreneurship stintstarted from there.
01:12:13.533 Tell me things about yourselfthat I can't Google.
01:12:17.453 Or watch in another interview of yours.
01:12:19.573 'Cause that's boring. I don't wanna know.
01:12:22.213 I mean... notorious kid, definitely.
01:12:26.133 And, I mean, I always had hungerto do something different.
01:12:32.733 And in college, like I said,I used to look for alternate sources.
01:12:36.773 I was again, let's say there was...
01:12:39.493 high-tech city was all call centresif you look into it.
01:12:41.853 Hyderabad that time.
01:12:43.573 Convergys and all.
01:12:45.093 So I thought of maybe doing a jobat a call centre.
01:12:47.133 Maybe pick some project at Convergys.
01:12:49.453 Not Convergys, maybe, Infosys was there.
01:12:51.173 Went to ISP to pitch something.
01:12:53.453 And maybe just started picking upsome projects at our college only,
01:12:56.413 where, you know,there was a fest happening,
01:12:58.293 "Could you bundle the T-shirts?"
01:12:59.493 So I think my first entrepreneurship timehappened from there on.
01:13:04.053 I started makinga little bit of pocket money from there.
01:13:07.133 But I was always insecure in lifethat I'll not get the job.
01:13:10.813 Otherwise I was like...
01:13:12.053 So you've finished college,and what did you do first?
01:13:14.573 When did you finish college?
01:13:16.373 So I finished college in 2004.
01:13:18.813 And I got placedin the manufacturing setup,
01:13:22.053 Orient Craft, if you would know.
01:13:23.973 Based out of Gurgaon.
01:13:25.133 So that is one of the largest export houseout of India.
01:13:29.173 I thought I would not geta better job than this.
01:13:31.973 So I stayed there.
01:13:33.413 And I workedfor three and a half years there.
01:13:35.333 It was typically merchandising.
01:13:37.773 And two years I did merchandising,I found it very boring.
01:13:41.333 And I thought of leaving the jobthat time because...
01:13:43.813 If you would know, merchandising is...
01:13:45.853 buyers say you somethingand then you copy paste.
01:13:48.253 I used to work for Ann Taylor, Gap,all those brands.
01:13:50.973 And then I started giving interviewsactually everywhere outside.
01:13:54.333 I went to Barista."Can I do job in marketing?"
01:13:56.933 Coffee Day was big. There was...
01:13:58.853 I went to Air Deccan for an interviewto apply for marketing.
01:14:01.613 I was fed up of my career that time.
01:14:04.053 Ironically, three peoplewho have proficiency in marketing
01:14:06.933 are running consumer electronic companies.
01:14:10.173 So maybe that's a prerequisite.
01:14:11.653 We could catchthe market pulse well, actually.
01:14:16.893 And maybe I didn't get a jobanywhere outside.
01:14:19.093 And I started taking onall special projects at the company.
01:14:23.293 What all the pain problems of the company,I could take that.
01:14:25.733 -And you worked with your brother?-No, no, no.
01:14:28.053 So my brother is ten years younger to me.
01:14:30.733 So he came in maybe... ten years ago.
01:14:35.973 Twenty-five.
01:14:37.413 For 15, 16, he came in.
01:14:39.453 -So I was---So he's 28.
01:14:41.613 So we are talking about 2005 to 2008.
01:14:44.133 He is 28 years old.
01:14:45.453 No, he's 35. 34, 35.
01:14:47.253 You're 38.
01:14:48.413 No, I am 43.
01:14:49.933 -You're 43.-Yeah, yeah. I'm 43.
01:14:53.613 So anyways, I worked therefor three and a half years
01:14:55.813 and then started picking up.
01:14:56.893 You look very good, yeah, for 43.
01:14:59.413 [Amit] Trying to.
01:15:00.933 Working with young founders,you have to stay true to that.
01:15:06.333 Anyways, so I workedfor three and a half years.
01:15:09.613 They moved me to...
01:15:11.333 I saw a huge gapin the international product development.
01:15:14.733 I picked up that piece,and that's my journey started.
01:15:18.133 I moved to Hong Kong for the first time.
01:15:20.253 And I think it was 2007 erawhere I saw global brands were there.
01:15:25.653 And whenever I used to travel,people used to ask me,
01:15:27.493 "Go and buy this thing for me,that thing for me."
01:15:29.253 I used to importa lot of BlackBerrys from there.
01:15:31.773 I think it was BlackBerry time.
01:15:33.613 So I used to buy and trade offfor 1,000, 2,000 bucks
01:15:36.293 and sell it in India in my office.
01:15:38.493 -It was like jailbreak phones.-[Rahul] Yeah.
01:15:40.813 So every time I used to go buy ten phonesand bring it here.
01:15:43.893 And eventually I realisedthat I'm solving a bigger problem,
01:15:46.973 not electronics, but textile.
01:15:48.933 Let me do it myself.
01:15:50.053 And I started my first business in 2007,
01:15:53.853 which was fashion accessory,textile merchandising, basically.
01:15:57.773 Buying house, quasi concept.
01:15:59.853 And I had 60,000 bucks in my pocket.
01:16:02.533 And again, how could you do a businesswith 60,000 bucks?
01:16:05.093 So I started it in '7,based out of Hong Kong.
01:16:07.853 And I think that's where my journeywith H&M started.
01:16:12.253 H&M was my first customer.
01:16:13.933 I worked with them very closelywith the design team.
01:16:16.933 So that's how I realised, man,
01:16:19.973 there are brandswhich are built at centre.
01:16:22.693 So India was, I think, fashion...Big Bazaar time that time.
01:16:26.973 It was Micromax and Big Bazaarwhich were at the bottom.
01:16:30.053 And H&M was right at the centre.
01:16:32.093 Not cheap, not luxury,but selling to the... to the world.
01:16:36.893 Uniqlo, H&M.
01:16:38.053 And that's how, I think,my roots got levelled
01:16:42.133 at good-quality productat an affordable price.
01:16:44.613 Not the cheapest, not the expensive.
01:16:46.653 I did that businessfor seven and a half years,
01:16:49.413 eight years, travelling a lot.
01:16:51.013 And then Gaurav, my cousin, actually,
01:16:54.333 he was 21,he became commercial pilot, I think,
01:16:57.933 Air Deccan time or Kingfisheror Jet Airways, something tanked.
01:17:01.013 No job.
01:17:02.253 And he asked meto get an iPhone that time.
01:17:04.013 It was just launched.
01:17:05.093 And I said, "Are you mad?"
01:17:06.453 [Nikhil] What year?
01:17:07.573 I think '14.
01:17:09.893 -What time iPhone---[Carl] The first one?
01:17:11.613 -Yeah.-2007 or '8?
01:17:13.933 -'8.-2007, '8.
01:17:15.613 So I think he asked me to getthe iPhone 3 sometime.
01:17:18.813 So I got an iPhone 3 for him,and I said, "Are you mad?"
01:17:20.773 It is 25,000 bucks.
01:17:22.733 And I got a jailbreak phonefrom Hong Kong for him.
01:17:26.853 And I got a phone for him.
01:17:28.893 He said,"Then I need to buy a cover for this."
01:17:31.413 And there were no covers for that phone.
01:17:33.613 And that's how our journey started.
01:17:35.133 He said, "Let me get...
01:17:37.013 I have a problem,can you solve it for me?"
01:17:40.293 If I have a problem,my other friend should have a problem.
01:17:43.333 So we started mobile accessoriesthat time.
01:17:45.053 In which year?
01:17:46.453 I think 2014, '15.
01:17:48.093 I think Xiaomi came to India that time.
01:17:50.813 We launched iPhone covers, we flopped.
01:17:52.933 All stocks are at home.
01:17:54.093 -Under the name Noise?-Yeah, it's under the name Noise.
01:17:56.733 So the company started in 2014.
01:17:58.653 '14, '15, we started doingmobile accessories as a side job.
01:18:02.053 He was, as a hobby, doing it.
01:18:03.653 I was doing my business, what I was doing.
01:18:06.813 And then, iPhone, we had a huge failure,because the market would be, what, .5%?
01:18:11.813 We were the only few customersbuying iPhone.
01:18:15.653 And then we flipped to Xiaomi.
01:18:18.373 He was doing a side project,and that's how our journey kicked in.
01:18:21.533 And then what happened?
01:18:24.293 The business started becoming very big.
01:18:26.533 The phone, all Chinese guys came in.
01:18:28.613 The business started becoming very big.
01:18:29.853 You sold accessoriesfor the Chinese phones?
01:18:32.453 Yeah, we sold accessories.
01:18:33.653 Because, see, please understand,we couldn't do tech.
01:18:36.413 I was coming from a fashion background.
01:18:37.853 I just knew designs.
01:18:39.773 And mobile cover is just an accessory.
01:18:42.093 I mean, it's like a T-shirt.
01:18:44.293 It's such a simple product.You get it, you print it.
01:18:46.333 We had a small setup alsomanufacturing in a factory
01:18:49.573 where we used to shipthousands of cases every day.
01:18:52.733 And then we realised that this marketis getting super commoditised.
01:18:56.693 And then when did Noise blow up?
01:18:59.213 -I think---COVID?
01:19:00.493 No, no, no, not COVID.
01:19:01.573 I think we started picking up in '19.
01:19:03.373 I'll tell you the trajectory,what happened in between.
01:19:06.933 So we were doing cases, which was fine.
01:19:09.653 And we realised that the pricingsare going down.
01:19:11.813 I mean, we started selling for 500 bucks,and eventually it landed to 150.
01:19:15.893 And 150, whatever case you sell,you can't make a big company.
01:19:19.253 So we were growing,
01:19:20.333 but we were some 100 crorerevenue company.
01:19:23.893 Then we thought of starting doingdifferent categories.
01:19:26.533 We launched, everybody said marketplaces,Flipkarts of the universe.
01:19:30.973 "Why don't you do headphones,neckbands, or whatever categories?"
01:19:34.893 We did that, we failed.
01:19:35.973 There was no differentiation.
01:19:38.013 There was no differentiation.
01:19:39.333 And then, out of interest,we realised what categories to pick.
01:19:43.053 So our thesis was clear,we'll not fight the big boys.
01:19:45.973 Like, Sony was selling wired earphones,or Philips.
01:19:49.253 I said, "Why would somebody buy us?"
01:19:50.573 Till that time, we were cheaper,and you can't be cheaper.
01:19:52.613 Till that time, you cut cost.
01:19:55.453 And we were searching for smartwatchfor ourselves that time in '19 something.
01:19:59.653 I don't remember that time.
01:20:01.453 And only Fitbit was availablefor 20,000 grands.
01:20:03.853 Fitbit Blaze or something.
01:20:04.973 We got a refurb watch for 10,000.
01:20:07.333 We realised,"Is this a gap in the market?"
01:20:10.333 And that's how we started doing watches.
01:20:12.653 The market was two million unitsthat time.
01:20:16.493 Maybe two million in a year.
01:20:18.573 Nobody was doing watches.
01:20:19.973 We started,then it picked up in three, four years.
01:20:22.813 And COVID, it picked up.
01:20:25.173 So I think there was a tipping point of--
01:20:26.773 So, watch was the tipping point?
01:20:28.373 Watch was the tipping point for us.
01:20:29.973 Because you were ableto buy refurbished for cheaper and--
01:20:33.213 No, no, no.We bought refurbished for ourselves.
01:20:35.693 But then we realisedthat there is a market which exists.
01:20:38.013 "Can we do in our brand where we could doa 5,000, 8,000 rupees watch,
01:20:43.533 which is affordableto a mid-level consumer?"
01:20:45.893 Good part, Gaurav was 25 that time.
01:20:48.733 So he had that young taste.
01:20:50.133 He never wanted to buy cheap.
01:20:51.813 And he never wanted to buythe most expensive one.
01:20:53.813 And all India marketwas Chinese knockoffs.
01:20:56.773 So that was the desire to build.
01:20:58.173 Can we use something for ourselvesand gift it to friends, family?
01:21:01.893 And today you are more known for earbuds?
01:21:04.133 No, no. We are not known for...
01:21:05.613 We are less known for earbuds.
01:21:07.013 We are dominant share for watches.
01:21:10.293 Watches is more tough category.
01:21:11.893 How much is your share now?
01:21:13.373 We would be north of 25%for last three, four years.
01:21:16.733 So watches are more complicated.
01:21:17.973 How big is the market?
01:21:20.213 -Close to a billion dollar market revenue.-Wow.
01:21:24.893 So how much are you selling now, Noise,in terms of revenues?
01:21:28.093 We would be... Watches we would haveclose to 10, 14% of the revenue share.
01:21:33.733 [Nikhil] So about 100, 140 million?
01:21:36.093 [Amit] Close to 100 million of revenue.
01:21:38.333 [Nikhil] And the rest of the productsin Noise?
01:21:40.773 Are audio devices.
01:21:42.173 So as of now, we were very clearthat we have limited capital.
01:21:45.133 We bootstrapped the business.
01:21:47.093 So we couldn't go very widthwise.We never had the--
01:21:49.613 Have you raised money now?
01:21:50.693 Last year,we raised a strategic investment
01:21:53.453 from Bose Corporation.
01:21:55.533 And now how big is the business,revenue-wise?
01:21:58.333 We would be somewhere sitting...150, 200 million, that kind of revenue.
01:22:04.293 Hundred in watchesand fifty to two hundred in others.
01:22:08.173 And we were very clear,we'll go deeper in the category
01:22:11.213 because we never had capitalto experiment multiple ways.
01:22:14.493 Crazy, huh? Super impressive.
01:22:17.053 To have been able to bootstrapto that scale, right?
01:22:20.253 I didn't know that.I thought you guys had raised the venture.
01:22:23.173 No, we didn't.I think it became a blessing for us
01:22:26.813 because, first, we never had to dress upour company for any external benefit.
01:22:31.653 Like today,sometimes investors says chase GMV,
01:22:34.653 second day they say chase market share,and sometimes profit.
01:22:38.493 So we were in that luxuryof taking our decisions,
01:22:42.173 which were right for the businessin long run.
01:22:44.573 So having less set of people,having less products,
01:22:49.213 go deeper in the categorieswhere you are in.
01:22:51.813 -Nikhil, this is what the difference is.-[Nikhil] Yeah.
01:22:53.653 These are the real businesses,
01:22:55.333 because, see, if you see all old,you know, businesses,
01:22:59.133 they were all comingfrom their own capital
01:23:02.133 or having access only to the banks,you know,
01:23:04.613 and taking the debt from the banksand doing those things.
01:23:06.853 It was not, like,raising an insane amount of capital
01:23:10.173 and say, "Okay, you goand experiment with somebody else."
01:23:12.533 -Yeah, yeah, yeah.-Right?
01:23:14.253 So...
01:23:15.933 -I think, yeah, these are the examples.-No, no, crazy impressive.
01:23:18.373 I like pushing peopleto see how they defend themselves.
01:23:20.453 Yeah. [chuckles]
01:23:21.573 I'm trying to figure out how to push Amit.
01:23:23.333 -Yeah.-Okay, so...
01:23:26.213 what is today for?
01:23:28.013 Today is for any young Indian boy or girl,under the age of 25,
01:23:32.333 who wants to starta consumer electronic brand.
01:23:36.133 It could be cell phone,it could be TV, it could be speaker,
01:23:39.613 it could be earphone,it could be smartwatch.
01:23:42.773 We want to, like, plot a road mapof what they need to look at,
01:23:47.893 how to identify the opportunity,which vendor to go to,
01:23:52.293 how to test the product,and how to finally take it to market.
01:23:55.573 We'll go intodo you sell on quick commerce,
01:23:58.453 do you sell on Amazon,do you sell through physical distribution?
01:24:02.613 So the first thing we thought we might dois establish market size.
01:24:07.613 How big is the consumer electronic market,
01:24:12.573 A, in the world, B, in India?
01:24:16.333 How fast is it growing there,and how fast is it growing here?
01:24:19.053 Should I start with smartphones?
01:24:20.213 Yeah.
01:24:21.533 Smartphones globallyis about 1.2 billion units every year.
01:24:25.333 In India it's 120 to 140 million annually,depending on what number you look at.
01:24:32.293 So if you assume that the ASP is $300,then 1.2 billion,
01:24:37.093 that's over $300 billion,just on the hardware side.
01:24:40.493 ASP is...
01:24:41.893 -Average selling price.-Average selling price.
01:24:43.373 Very different in Indiacompared to the rest of the world?
01:24:45.773 Yeah. Every country is differentdepending on the market dynamics.
01:24:50.733 -Per capita as well.-Yeah.
01:24:52.373 Where is the sweet spot?
01:24:53.653 If I want to start makinga cell phone today,
01:24:57.293 where would I price it?
01:25:00.453 Personally, I don't thinkthere is any more opportunity.
01:25:02.213 Oh, man, I wouldn't recommendany of my friends
01:25:04.333 to go into this business right now.
01:25:06.733 The market is very, very toughto compete in.
01:25:09.813 But you need to understandthat what exactly,
01:25:13.093 if you want to make that,what exactly are you trying to solve?
01:25:15.533 Are you trying to, let's say,make a luxury brand,
01:25:18.933 or are you going to make a mass brand?
01:25:21.693 Basis is that you need to figure outyour TAM.
01:25:26.253 That what is the marketI'm going to address.
01:25:29.493 And basis is that you can define,"Okay, this is that, you know,"
01:25:31.773 then you can find the sweet spot.
01:25:32.853 Because otherwise the category is like,
01:25:36.053 if you see mobile phones,iPhone is $1,000.
01:25:41.373 And then your, you know,
01:25:43.573 the average selling price,as he said, is right,
01:25:45.893 between, you know, $250 to $300 in India.
01:25:50.533 So maybe let me break itfor India market perspective
01:25:54.093 so that at least viewerscould understand it well.
01:25:56.773 In a category like truly wireless,for an example,
01:25:59.173 the India marketwould be like 60 million units.
01:26:01.733 In a category like?
01:26:02.813 Audio devices, for an example, like this.
01:26:04.653 This marketwould be like 60 million devices,
01:26:06.853 which is six crores.
01:26:07.933 Yeah.
01:26:09.813 -And 90% of this---And value-wise?
01:26:12.693 Around a billion dollar market value.
01:26:16.493 Can you just tell mefor India specifically?
01:26:20.253 Yeah. Yeah.
01:26:21.613 How much is smartphone, how much is TV,how much is earphone, how much is watch?
01:26:26.093 So, like this...
01:26:30.253 Phones would beabout $150 million, phones?
01:26:32.133 One-fifty million devices in India,am I right?
01:26:34.213 One-fifty million smartphones,
01:26:35.533 and let's say still there are like around50, 60 million feature phones.
01:26:38.573 Feature phones.
01:26:39.653 So on a broad level,India has a penetration
01:26:42.053 of 600 million smartphone usersin the country.
01:26:45.493 That's the right base to look at it.
01:26:47.853 Sixty crore people use smartphones,is that right?
01:26:51.053 -More or less.-Yeah. More or less.
01:26:52.653 I think you gotta look at the annual,like, 120, 140 number.
01:26:55.853 [Nikhil] They broadly say that 72 billion
01:26:57.653 is the consumer electronic marketin India.
01:27:01.413 -[Carl] How much?-Seventy-two billion.
01:27:04.053 Per year.
01:27:05.853 Total consumer electronics?
01:27:09.853 USD or INR?
01:27:10.933 No, billion dollar he is talking about.
01:27:12.613 In that they say cell phones,smart plus feature is 50 billion.
01:27:19.013 Very true. I think large marketwould be smartphones only.
01:27:23.173 -[Nikhil] Right?-[Carl] Yeah.
01:27:24.813 So in all the consumer electronicsin India,
01:27:27.333 because you make TVs and everything else,
01:27:29.213 and you make earphonesand watch and all that,
01:27:32.093 where is the opportunity?
01:27:34.333 For me, say I am a 20-year-old kid
01:27:37.773 who has managed to raise some moneyfrom somewhere,
01:27:39.853 and I want to compete in this space.
01:27:41.693 Where is the opportunity?
01:27:44.613 Tell me anything,tell me wired earphone, tell me...
01:27:47.733 No, so first of all,I think anybody who wanna enter a space,
01:27:52.373 first of all, everybody should enterto a space which is growing
01:27:55.653 and has a larger time.
01:27:56.773 There is no point to enter to a space
01:27:58.253 which doesn't growor doesn't have a future.
01:28:00.893 For an example,it's not large enough because--
01:28:03.053 You are saying first you make a box of--
01:28:05.053 I mean, if the segment is big and growing,then it's a point to go
01:28:08.653 because if you're a 2% player also,you will be a sizable company.
01:28:11.573 Let's say if you go in a marketwhich is 1,000 crore overall revenue,
01:28:15.133 you become 5% also,you would be a 50 crore company.
01:28:17.493 -It doesn't make sense.-Which one is growing?
01:28:19.773 The fastest.
01:28:21.053 No, so, okay, in our space,
01:28:22.853 let me take you through top-down,you might understand.
01:28:25.613 Let's say in this case,
01:28:26.693 this is a 60 million-odd deviceswe sell in a year,
01:28:29.653 which is six crores.
01:28:31.093 And interestingly,90% devices get sold below $25,
01:28:35.293 which is sub 2,000 rupees.
01:28:37.013 You're talking about Bluetooth earphones?
01:28:38.653 Bluetooth earphones.
01:28:40.173 And that is 60% of the market revenue.
01:28:43.213 Which is what 5,000 crore is like,this market.
01:28:50.253 And $25 to $75, which is medium segment,entry-mid premium,
01:28:55.093 that is close to 7%...
01:28:58.493 and would be 15% of the market.
01:29:01.373 And then it is all $150 plus,
01:29:04.893 majority Apple,1% market share, and then...
01:29:09.013 [Nikhil] So are you sayingit's a good market?
01:29:10.573 If I want to start,say I have raised one million dollars.
01:29:13.573 Should I start a earphone, earpod company?
01:29:15.973 So I personally think technology worksin a very different way.
01:29:18.853 It's not like fashion,
01:29:20.013 where you just create a productand sell it at any price point.
01:29:25.973 Technology you need an access to partnerswe were talking about,
01:29:29.133 a lot of proprietary things.
01:29:31.493 So I think it's a very tough spacefor somebody to enter.
01:29:34.053 Yes, somebody want to enter into sub $20,yes, they can.
01:29:37.533 But that's the race to bottom.
01:29:38.973 And 20 to 50, which is a sweet spot,like a 1,000 or 1,500 crore market,
01:29:43.453 it's tough,and bigger brands are sitting there.
01:29:45.813 And when you say partner,everybody's partner is China?
01:29:48.533 No, no, it's not about those partners.
01:29:50.053 We have partners.
01:29:51.533 So one is partnerswho are giving us chipsets,
01:29:55.693 but then you need to haveyour own app teams,
01:29:58.573 you need to have your own algorithmswe were talking about.
01:30:02.053 So those expertise is also needed.
01:30:03.973 -Mainly supply chain.-Supply chain. Yeah.
01:30:06.213 For us, we have US partners,Chinese partners, Japanese, Korean.
01:30:11.173 Yes, it's very international.
01:30:12.893 So how do I... Say I have an ideato start an earpod company,
01:30:17.693 how do I connect with these partners?
01:30:21.533 I'm a newbie, I have no track record.
01:30:23.653 You have not worked in this industry?
01:30:25.173 -I've not worked in this industry.-Completely coming from outside?
01:30:27.853 I personally think, Nikhil,
01:30:29.613 it's really tough until and unlessyou're getting to a segment
01:30:33.853 which is fairly newand not being cracked by all of us.
01:30:36.813 I mean, a niche space.
01:30:38.653 But, see,you guys started recently, right?
01:30:40.573 -You started---I'll give you one example.
01:30:42.293 So I did OnePlus,
01:30:44.333 so I'm relatively knownin the industry, right?
01:30:46.133 In the electronics industry.
01:30:48.893 And when we started this new company,Nothing, we wanted to make phones.
01:30:53.133 Nobody wanted to make phones for us.
01:30:55.133 They said,"Hey, look at the past ten years.
01:30:57.413 So many startups have come and failed,and why are you different?
01:31:00.653 You raise money. They also raise money.
01:31:02.573 You have experience.They also have experience.
01:31:05.213 We're not gonna make a phone for you.
01:31:06.613 Like, go away."
01:31:08.213 And then we're like,"Okay, we can't make a phone.
01:31:11.573 Maybe we can make earbuds firstto prove ourselves,
01:31:13.733 to prove the skills of our team."
01:31:15.853 We go to the earbud factories,and they also tell us to go away.
01:31:20.173 They're like, "Hey, just go on Amazon.There's 2,000, 3,000 earbuds brands.
01:31:25.253 Who are you? What's your differentiation?
01:31:27.253 What's your strategy?How much money have you raised?
01:31:30.933 Go away."
01:31:32.693 We were shocked.
01:31:34.413 We thought we had some reputationin the industry
01:31:37.733 that some of the factorieswanna work with us.
01:31:40.333 So what changed? How did you do it?
01:31:42.973 We went to the worst factory.
01:31:45.693 Like, the factory,if they didn't take us on as a client,
01:31:49.693 they would go out of business immediately.
01:31:50.973 In China?
01:31:52.053 In China,because they were on the blacklist
01:31:53.893 of a lot of other peoplefor quality issues.
01:31:55.813 And how did you find this factory?
01:31:59.493 One of my co-founders, I think he...
01:32:02.933 yeah, he knew some of the salespeoplein the supply chain
01:32:04.973 and found this factory.
01:32:06.733 But this was a factorythat had been put on the blacklist
01:32:12.333 'cause of quality issues.
01:32:13.853 But we had no other choice.
01:32:15.173 Nobody wanted to work for us.
01:32:16.853 That's where we started.
01:32:17.933 That's true for all of us.
01:32:19.013 We had to start work with factorieswhich were less known.
01:32:22.613 People don't want to work
01:32:23.693 because bigger factoriesdon't want to touch you also.
01:32:25.653 They are saying we are happymaking Apple, Boses of the universe,
01:32:29.493 and we don't want to--
01:32:31.093 But how do, I as a 20-year-old,find this factory?
01:32:33.613 Like, you had somebody.
01:32:34.773 I think you can't. Like, they won't--
01:32:36.973 What if I just go to Chinaand look for them?
01:32:39.253 There is no reason for them to engage.Like...
01:32:43.573 Nikhil, these are the large businesses,
01:32:45.133 for example,if you see the size in terms of value,
01:32:48.453 automobile and mobile phonewill be similar.
01:32:50.453 -In terms of value.-Very right.
01:32:52.693 So if I reach out to one of you guys,
01:32:55.133 if I happen to know you,and ask that you connect me to a factory,
01:32:59.613 is that the way to do it?
01:33:01.133 If we connect also to the factories,
01:33:03.493 factories has no motivationto work with you
01:33:05.733 because everybody works with MOQ,certain processes.
01:33:10.533 -[Carl] Yeah.-They find you working with...
01:33:14.093 I would need to pitch who you are.
01:33:15.853 I will go to this founder of the factory.
01:33:17.653 "Hey, I have a friendwho wants to talk to you.
01:33:20.653 This is this person's backgroundand credentials.
01:33:23.373 Can I make the intro or not?"
01:33:25.893 So...
01:33:27.213 So I have a recent examplegoing on right now.
01:33:29.493 So right now we have this technologyof making connected glasses.
01:33:34.533 Right.
01:33:35.973 Because we feel that's the future,that's where buyers are going to move.
01:33:39.493 We are trying to find outwho are the right brands
01:33:42.773 who can do these glasses
01:33:45.133 and established brandsin the glasses space,
01:33:49.413 right now who exist,pitching it to them that, "Hey, look--"
01:33:52.093 Like Meta glasses?
01:33:53.333 -Exactly same.-[Nikhil] Right.
01:33:54.533 Exactly same.
01:33:55.613 Actually, with Meta, along with Meta.
01:33:59.853 When you say along with Meta--
01:34:01.253 Meta, the operating system,for example, the whole AI is from Meta.
01:34:05.893 So, for example, they have donethe same partnership with Luxottica,
01:34:09.973 -Ray-Ban, similar.-[Nikhil] Right. Right.
01:34:13.973 Do you guys thinkthere is an opportunity there?
01:34:16.013 The form is changing,
01:34:17.213 and it moves from cell phoneto something else?
01:34:21.293 No, I think, interestingly,our industry is evolving every decade.
01:34:25.173 So, like, nobody thought that Nokiacould be disrupted, for an example.
01:34:29.533 So any of our devices could be disrupted,and form factors are definitely changing.
01:34:34.213 People are working aggressivelyon glasses.
01:34:37.533 So that is one form factor to look into.
01:34:39.853 But like he said,it's a game of people who have...
01:34:43.133 For glasses,I think all mobility is working.
01:34:45.613 Entire mobile brands in the worldare working towards that.
01:34:48.293 So it becomes very difficultfor a young company to still compete.
01:34:52.733 Glasses, you can do.
01:34:55.053 Glasses, you can do.
01:34:56.573 [Amit] You got one...
01:34:59.213 one gap.
01:35:00.613 No, there is. Because, see,look at the glasses industry.
01:35:04.573 Last year, Meta, with Luxottica,and these are public numbers,
01:35:08.973 they sold two million glasses,two million.
01:35:12.733 And the number what is being projectedin the next four years
01:35:16.253 is around 30 million.
01:35:17.333 That's a CAGR of, let's say,more than 43, 45% on an annual basis.
01:35:24.173 Right?
01:35:25.253 And... since we have been working on that,so the tech is...
01:35:30.133 So earlier the glasses camewith only speaker here.
01:35:33.533 -Yeah, yeah.-Right?
01:35:34.813 -Old. Yeah, yeah.-Yeah?
01:35:37.053 Gen 2, there was a camera.
01:35:38.613 Yeah.
01:35:41.573 And let's say Gen 3with this whole AI engine coming in there.
01:35:47.093 Gen 4, you have a heads-up display.
01:35:48.933 Correct.
01:35:50.173 Now once you have a heads-up display,
01:35:52.413 then whatever, for example,is going on my cell phone,
01:35:54.733 I have a display here.
01:35:56.173 On the frame?
01:35:57.453 No, no, not on the frame.
01:35:58.613 It is a heads-up displaylike you have in your cars.
01:36:00.093 You are projecting onto a wall.
01:36:01.253 No, no, not on the wall.
01:36:03.093 -Just like in a car speedometer.-Yeah, yeah.
01:36:05.533 It is a heads-up display. You can see.
01:36:07.493 So here I can see.
01:36:09.373 So today, for example, if it is in,let's say, black and white,
01:36:14.053 tomorrow it will be all coloured.
01:36:15.733 It will evolve.
01:36:17.573 And then, for example,if you are watching your Instagram Reels,
01:36:20.573 you are just flicking it.
01:36:22.853 Just sitting,and then you are not taking out your phone
01:36:24.533 because rest of...
01:36:25.653 See, in your phone, you have a display,you have speaker, mic, and a camera.
01:36:31.813 All things are solved.
01:36:34.133 Then why do you needto take out your phone?
01:36:36.133 Do you think that will be the futureof form?
01:36:38.573 Cell phone will move to glasses?
01:36:40.453 See, nobody can just firmly say that,"Okay, this is..."
01:36:43.413 Although, for example, Zuckerberg has saidthat this is going to be.
01:36:46.493 But he said the Oculusand all of those things
01:36:49.053 were the form as well for a long time,which didn't play out, right?
01:36:51.653 [Rahul] You're correct.
01:36:53.413 So, as I said, see, it is nothing right,nothing wrong.
01:36:56.693 You have to go out in the marketand test it out.
01:36:58.533 -Hmm.-[Rahul] Right?
01:37:00.093 But looking at the tech right now,what exactly is it going to solve?
01:37:04.893 I think I've seenall the new glasses coming up.
01:37:07.893 I seriously feel that this will bethe form factor to watch out for.
01:37:12.253 -[Nikhil] Right.-[Rahul] Yes.
01:37:13.933 So if somebody new watching thiswants to get into the industry,
01:37:17.093 this is the industry.
01:37:19.173 -Right.-I have a different approach.
01:37:22.333 If somebody was young and watching this
01:37:24.373 and wanting to getinto consumer electronics,
01:37:27.333 I would urge themto first become a content creator.
01:37:30.813 Bang on!
01:37:31.893 -Marketing.-Because the barrier to entry is very low.
01:37:34.933 Everybody can do it.
01:37:36.693 And that is the arbitrage opportunity now.
01:37:38.693 Like, the millennialsand the older people,
01:37:41.693 they're gonna have a harder time to learnthe latest algorithms, latest trends.
01:37:45.253 100%.
01:37:47.653 If you do the content well, like MrBeast,now you can do anything.
01:37:51.333 You can make chocolates,you can make a TV show on Amazon.
01:37:55.133 When you have the traffic,you have leverage to sell any product.
01:37:59.773 Then when I do the intro to the factory,they will, "That's MrBeast, of course."
01:38:03.773 He's just some random kid,it's impossible.
01:38:06.173 But I feel there are very niche spaceswhich are coming up
01:38:10.653 which none of us are solvingas bigger companies.
01:38:13.973 When you look at our space,this product...
01:38:17.773 hearing aids, is a decent space.
01:38:19.653 But right now it's like 150,000,1,50,000 rupees or $2,000,
01:38:25.213 there is a hearing aid, it looks ugly.
01:38:28.653 I see industry working in a spacewhich is over-the-counter hearing aids,
01:38:33.493 way affordable, looking better.
01:38:36.053 That is one market.
01:38:37.893 And when you look at our category,wearables,
01:38:39.893 I see now penetration has happenedin wearables.
01:38:42.493 Like, as parents, we have used, Rahul.
01:38:44.933 Now the problem is we have aging parents.
01:38:47.333 We need a device for themwhich could monitor their health.
01:38:49.613 And more importantly,we live in urban cities, we have kids.
01:38:54.893 And you won't believe, I get a messagefrom five people every day,
01:38:58.253 "Do you have a kid's watch?"
01:38:59.693 Because none of usare looking at this space,
01:39:01.573 the space stands at zero.
01:39:03.173 You're saying for kidsand senior monitoring?
01:39:05.373 I mean, we have two spaces,because, see, first market--
01:39:07.973 But can't an Apple Watch do that?
01:39:10.613 Apple Watch does it,but it's 50,000 rupees.
01:39:13.653 Will India price point get solvedwith 50,000 bucks?
01:39:16.813 India would need a watch for a parent,maybe at eight to ten thousand rupees.
01:39:21.653 Not a 50,000, 100%.
01:39:24.213 So coming up to his point of hearing aids.
01:39:29.013 Again, anybody watching,there's a space to disrupt.
01:39:32.573 Because all the hearing aids, if you see,
01:39:33.813 are, like, one lakh rupees,two lakh rupees,
01:39:36.893 -close to three lakh rupees.-Two lakh rupees.
01:39:39.173 I, you know,went to buy for my dad to a doctor.
01:39:42.853 It's 1.5 lakh rupees, hearing aid.
01:39:46.133 And I said, "You have a better one?"
01:39:47.893 He said, "Yeah, it's two lakh rupees."
01:39:49.613 I said, "What is the difference?""Software difference."
01:39:52.053 On phone.
01:39:53.573 With this, we give you three moreextra features which you can unlock.
01:39:56.533 -It's very uncompetitive market.-Yeah.
01:39:58.533 I said, "Why?"
01:40:00.453 He said, "No, no, with these features,you'll be able to understand
01:40:04.213 if the voice is comingfrom behind or front, all these things."
01:40:07.053 Then I went intowhy these hearing aids are expensive.
01:40:11.733 Because back then,
01:40:13.453 putting something in a small form factorwas expensive.
01:40:18.173 Was expensive at that time.
01:40:19.733 But not today.
01:40:20.813 I think, no,it's not about this also, Rahul.
01:40:23.613 So cost would be cheaper forthe manufacturer who is selling it brand.
01:40:26.373 But it's just about only one or two brandsdoing that business,
01:40:29.613 selling at maybe 80%, 90% gross margin.
01:40:32.013 -There is one company I'm just forgetting.-They have the majority market share.
01:40:34.493 They have all the three big brands
01:40:35.653 -in the world.-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:40:37.333 -Hearing aids?-Yeah.
01:40:38.653 There is one companywho has bought out all others.
01:40:40.533 Three to four big brands in the world.
01:40:42.053 Is it a big market?
01:40:43.533 It's a narrow, not big.
01:40:45.893 -But---Is there another advice?
01:40:48.253 Pick narrow markets
01:40:49.333 where the large incumbentsare not going after?
01:40:52.533 -Yes, if you're passionate about it.-[Amit] Yeah.
01:40:55.373 Passion has to keep you going.
01:40:56.853 Explain, like, why would I be passionateabout hearing aids?
01:40:59.253 That's what I mean.
01:41:00.333 If you are not passionateabout a business you're starting,
01:41:02.853 like, businesses are tough.
01:41:04.373 There are some good daysand a lot of terrible days.
01:41:07.213 So if you are not really in lovewith what you are doing,
01:41:09.373 it's hard to perseverewhen it gets really difficult.
01:41:13.213 But can I be passionateabout hearing aids?
01:41:14.773 Some people are passionate about it.
01:41:16.293 Some people are, by the way.They are trying to solve real problems.
01:41:18.813 No, we are.
01:41:20.533 If somebody wants to do it, you know,crack the code, go out of it.
01:41:25.933 So, for example, you are sayingyou want to introduce someone and all.
01:41:29.413 I mean, we can introduce to themall the chipset players,
01:41:31.813 you know, all whatever.
01:41:32.933 Because nobody is there in that spacethat's available for somebody to take on.
01:41:36.293 And we are ready to fund them.
01:41:38.093 100%.
01:41:39.173 Think I am not interviewing you guys.
01:41:42.253 Think I am a 20-year-old boysitting in a room.
01:41:45.613 I have had the great opportunityof sitting with three of you.
01:41:48.653 I have a million dollars.
01:41:50.013 I want to build somethingin consumer electronics.
01:41:52.413 I live in Bangalore, in India.
01:41:54.973 So you three have a conversation,and I will try and learn along the way.
01:41:59.213 And intervene once in a while.
01:42:00.653 What else?
01:42:01.733 We have already given the cards,for example.
01:42:03.973 You know, the glasses, hearing aids.
01:42:07.853 -[Nikhil] What else?-What not-- I'll be very clear.
01:42:09.973 If somebody is trying to goto a commodity market, it's no-go.
01:42:14.053 It's a race to bottom.There is no winning there.
01:42:15.733 What is a commodity?
01:42:17.253 I mean, let's say somebody says,
01:42:18.333 "I want to do a earbudwhich is 1,500 bucks."
01:42:21.693 No go.
01:42:22.773 How will you win?
01:42:23.853 I mean, what's your right to winwhen there's overcrowded market?
01:42:26.973 And when large players are there.
01:42:28.733 I am a content creator.I have distribution.
01:42:30.333 Let's add that.
01:42:31.413 I'll tell you, content creatoralso has a shelf threshold of,
01:42:35.293 let's say,whatever million followers they have.
01:42:37.413 They could reach to 5,000 units,10,000 units, not beyond that.
01:42:41.453 Did somebody, a content creator,recently sell a watch, and he sold a lot?
01:42:45.733 -Yeah.-What was his name?
01:42:47.893 Shlok, nah?
01:42:49.333 Anarc. Layers.
01:42:50.853 -Yeah.-Shlok.
01:42:52.013 -Yeah, yeah, yeah.-Tech Burner.
01:42:54.253 So they did it, but if you look into it--
01:42:56.653 What if the kid is ten timesor hundred times bigger than Tech Burner?
01:43:03.093 MrBeast has done that.
01:43:04.173 But I'm just saying.Tech is very different.
01:43:06.213 Tech, they failed because the productwas not up to the mark.
01:43:10.733 They were new in the town.
01:43:12.253 See, it's not like selling T-shirt.
01:43:13.453 You can just stitch it and sell it.
01:43:14.973 And there is no tech to it.
01:43:16.933 A same factory makes a 300-rupees T-shirtand a 30,000-rupees T-shirt also.
01:43:20.733 Tech is not like that.
01:43:21.813 But if you're outsourcing the tech,the production,
01:43:24.493 if you're going to a co-packer almost--
01:43:26.253 No, it's not like this business.
01:43:29.173 So, like all of us,we choose what components to get into.
01:43:33.493 That will get into it.It's a super customised business.
01:43:36.653 Some of the software layersare being customised
01:43:38.733 at our level in our teams.
01:43:40.853 Some are outsourced.
01:43:41.933 -Am I right, Carl?-Yes.
01:43:43.293 And then we design a product,and then it comes out.
01:43:46.053 It's like a CPU.
01:43:47.573 It's just not you buy from it.
01:43:49.133 You choose specific components,run software on it, develop software.
01:43:54.093 It's not that easy.That's why companies are failing.
01:43:55.893 So I had the same ideabefore trying this business.
01:44:00.573 There's a bunch of factories.They all know how to make it.
01:44:02.413 We just go and order and then pay them.
01:44:04.893 It shows up. Done.
01:44:07.133 That can't be further away from the truth.
01:44:09.973 Like, these factories, sure,they have the common models
01:44:12.373 that you can buy off the shelf.
01:44:13.573 -But everybody can buy those.-[Amit] Yeah.
01:44:15.653 And they don't have the best engineers.
01:44:17.173 Like, the best engineers,they're not gonna work for a factory.
01:44:19.613 They're gonna work for Appleor Samsung or, like, a brand, right?
01:44:22.333 So they don't have good engineering.
01:44:24.053 So what is happening in China,and what is happening at Apple?
01:44:26.213 Explain the engineering process.
01:44:28.413 We just were discussingwhen we went on a break.
01:44:31.013 About the camera.
01:44:32.093 -Yeah.-Yeah.
01:44:33.173 Yeah, camera is a great example.
01:44:35.733 Like, if you wanna create...
01:44:39.093 There are so many fieldswithin these products, right?
01:44:40.733 There is a radio antenna,there is industrial design,
01:44:43.213 there is camera, there is software.
01:44:44.893 It's like so many different things.
01:44:46.293 Everything requires a lot of investmentand time and energy to do it well.
01:44:50.533 So I think maybe taking a step back.
01:44:53.573 One piece of adviceis to really also respect
01:44:56.773 whatever new thing you're doing.
01:44:58.653 Like, "Okay, now we are making earbuds.
01:45:00.893 Let's learn about how to make earbuds,how everything works.
01:45:03.973 Well, now we're doing camera tuning.Let's really learn about how that works."
01:45:07.573 So we just have a very simplistic viewand outsource it to other people.
01:45:11.333 If we don't even knowwhat the underlying principles are,
01:45:14.973 it's gonna be very bad.
01:45:16.253 So just for camera,we've been struggling with camera.
01:45:21.133 This year, it got a lot better.
01:45:23.973 It's not that we are not smart enough.
01:45:25.773 But the camerais a very hardcore resource investment.
01:45:29.693 The way it works is you make the phonerecognise the scene.
01:45:32.813 The scene could betwo people sitting here.
01:45:34.733 It could be nighttime. It could be city.
01:45:37.053 Fruits.
01:45:38.373 Fruits. The more scenes you can define,the better your pictures will be.
01:45:42.093 The more you can define,then each scene will have its own tuning.
01:45:46.373 The team will tune it differentlydepending on the scene
01:45:48.293 to make it as beautiful as possiblefor this specific scene.
01:45:52.053 So if I have a big team,I can define a lot of different scenes.
01:45:55.653 So then there's a very high likelihood
01:45:58.013 that the phone will tune itin a way that's nice.
01:46:00.853 If I have a small team,I can only define a few scenes.
01:46:04.013 So if I only have a few scenes,
01:46:05.173 then I'll miss a lot of the long-tailpotential use cases for the camera.
01:46:09.333 And customers are not gonna be happy.
01:46:10.813 Yeah, I think identifying gaps,and as I said,
01:46:15.213 you know, in terms of passion,you were saying.
01:46:17.373 So still so many categories are there.
01:46:19.973 Example.
01:46:21.293 Let's take example of Dyson.
01:46:22.813 Can you disrupt?
01:46:23.893 Bang on.
01:46:25.253 So if you look at India as a market,there is no Dyson.
01:46:27.733 It's just Dyson,which is like 40,000 bucks,
01:46:30.053 and there is Bajaj to buy.
01:46:31.213 No. So there is a companycalled SharkNinja.
01:46:34.293 The number one in USA.
01:46:36.133 -[Amit] There.-Disrupted as in completely.
01:46:37.773 By Dyson, do you mean vacuum cleaner,hair blower--
01:46:40.653 Home. Home. Home.
01:46:42.533 You see, if you look at it,there is no young brand in home.
01:46:45.093 Look at the customer.
01:46:47.093 Our parents grew up buying Bajaj.
01:46:49.533 We aspire to buy Dyson,but Dyson is too expensive.
01:46:52.373 So look at that 25 to 35 age group,what they would buy.
01:46:56.253 So, for example,if I have to use an analogy,
01:46:58.853 -if Dyson is the Mercedes-Benz...-[Amit] Yeah. No, Toyota is there.
01:47:02.253 Yeah, a Toyota, a Honda, or a Hyundai.
01:47:05.733 We have Maruti.
01:47:07.613 So Maruti is Bajaj?
01:47:09.493 I mean, those kind of companies, yeah.
01:47:12.293 So, you know, these are the segments.
01:47:14.213 So you have to really identify those gapsand say, "Yes. Is there a market?"
01:47:19.853 And I think, go for it.
01:47:21.773 And if you have a passion and all,you will figure out a way,
01:47:24.413 you know, find out the right people.
01:47:26.733 Maybe take a step-by-step approach.
01:47:28.813 Instead of starting your own company,work for somebody else,
01:47:32.373 -like me.-Learn it.
01:47:36.013 If there are so many mistakes you can makein our industry,
01:47:40.893 if I did not do it, like, once before,
01:47:43.413 the chances of failurewould have been way higher.
01:47:46.133 It's, like, eight to nine monthsof a cycle when you're committed.
01:47:49.253 And when you're committed,
01:47:50.333 you are committedwith few million dollars.
01:47:52.173 You cannot get out.
01:47:55.013 Carl, you have said the easiest wayto differentiate is design.
01:48:00.333 In a bunch of interviews.
01:48:02.253 Can't I look at the same devices,but relook design altogether?
01:48:07.533 And do what design?
01:48:09.013 Like, relookmy design philosophy altogether.
01:48:12.213 Why do earbuds have to look like this?
01:48:14.413 What if I changethe form factor completely?
01:48:16.773 Then there is PMF risk.
01:48:18.853 What is PMF risk?
01:48:20.213 Product-market fit risk.
01:48:22.813 So if you look at our products,that product and this product,
01:48:27.053 design is different,but actually there is very low PMF risk
01:48:30.133 because these are productsthat consumers already know how to use,
01:48:34.693 what to use it for.
01:48:36.213 They already buy a lot of themevery single year.
01:48:38.653 If you deviate too muchfrom the current product definition,
01:48:41.853 then you have to take care of the risk.
01:48:45.293 And then it's a questionof whether the risk versus the reward
01:48:49.133 could potentially be worth it.
01:48:50.453 But there's no way to test it?
01:48:52.813 You can test it, you can do a mock-up,
01:48:55.493 you can even use AI to generate a pictureand then go and speak to people.
01:49:00.053 But I think besides mock-up,it is all about functionality, usage,
01:49:04.453 so that also plays a bigger role.
01:49:06.013 So I think we don't want to changepeople behaviours the way they are doing.
01:49:10.293 Little changes--
01:49:11.373 It is a different business strategy.
01:49:13.053 I think we'rein the fast follower strategy
01:49:16.053 or late mover strategy.
01:49:17.293 Explain.
01:49:19.213 So we're coming into an industrythat already got created by other people,
01:49:23.853 and we're just trying to carve outour space within a big industry,
01:49:27.333 a billion-units-a-year industrythat was created by other people.
01:49:30.813 So then we do not take the risk.
01:49:33.613 We come into a very mature category,
01:49:36.173 and then we can differentiatethrough design.
01:49:38.733 But if you're creating something new,like, back in the day, drones were new,
01:49:42.533 or now electric vehicles are new,or robotics,
01:49:46.013 then you do not have to differentiateon the product
01:49:48.373 because the technology is fresh enoughas a differentiator.
01:49:51.893 But then you have the execution riskon the technology and also the PMF risk
01:49:57.253 on whether consumers will wanna adoptthis product or not.
01:50:01.773 I personally think late moveris easier for me.
01:50:06.733 That requires a different way of thinking,more survival-focused,
01:50:10.973 more capability-building,more long-term thinking.
01:50:14.133 Whereas the technology approachis more like, you have one shot.
01:50:18.093 If it works, it works.
01:50:19.173 If it does not work,you gotta start over again.
01:50:24.893 -So just asking Carl on...-[Nikhil] Yeah, yeah.
01:50:26.933 So, Carl, on the phones, for example,
01:50:29.693 where do you think...some disruption can happen?
01:50:34.533 I think the disruption can happenon the OS side.
01:50:37.533 I think the hardware side is very hardto differentiate on
01:50:41.653 because all these suppliers that we have,
01:50:44.933 they're all very concentrated,and they're very strong,
01:50:47.813 and they're investingin their product road map,
01:50:50.653 upgrading their batteries and processorsincrementally every year.
01:50:54.493 Like, we cannot really differentiate.
01:50:57.413 And as a supplier,you wanna sell to everybody, right?
01:51:00.253 But if the form factors are changing now,foldable phones are coming in,
01:51:05.253 don't you think if we can bring the costby innovation of the foldable phones down,
01:51:10.533 it will have a mass adoption?
01:51:11.693 Because relatively,it's a game-changing thing
01:51:14.733 because from a single screen,you're going to a bigger screen.
01:51:18.053 -Yeah.-Or maybe a triple screen.
01:51:19.453 That's also not up to us, right?
01:51:21.333 'Cause the screen manufacturer
01:51:23.333 is the real decision makerfor that product.
01:51:27.213 It's not us.
01:51:28.733 Also, just to add onto it,the screen manufacturer is also booked,
01:51:31.813 and he also wants to take advantage of itbecause he knows after three years,
01:51:35.013 there's gonna be the same priceas a normal screen.
01:51:37.573 So he will also not reduce the price.
01:51:39.133 And you wanna go with the biggest vendorinstead of a startup like us.
01:51:42.653 So I think for us,
01:51:44.013 our biggest opportunity to differentiatein our next phase
01:51:47.813 -is through the OS.-OS.
01:51:50.893 I think the next differentiationfor all of us
01:51:53.573 would be through software only.
01:51:55.893 But aren't you using one of two softwareswhich are in the market
01:52:00.213 and operating your devices on that?
01:52:03.173 [Amit] So we...
01:52:05.013 So phones is a different universe.
01:52:07.213 They're Android or iOS.
01:52:09.653 But in our case,we work on open RTOS operating system,
01:52:13.733 where we build our operating system there.
01:52:17.693 -Right.-And what I mean is,
01:52:19.733 more softwares would come in like,
01:52:22.173 "Could I fine-tune my audio
01:52:25.613 based on my hearing capabilitiesof my ear?"
01:52:27.733 Like, Apple is doing it now.It's pure software.
01:52:30.853 "Or could I have AI capabilities in thisso that I could interact it?"
01:52:34.893 A lot of companies are workingon a friend kind of a concept.
01:52:37.813 So it's all software,what I see is happening.
01:52:39.533 And the same is gonna happen on the...
01:52:42.413 Today we're based on Android,
01:52:43.853 but I see some disruption opportunitiesto become the next Android.
01:52:48.573 Like?
01:52:50.253 I think there's a couple of trends, right?
01:52:54.973 The one trend is...
01:52:57.773 if you look at the current big OSes,iOS and Android,
01:53:01.453 they're very successful already.
01:53:03.293 Android has three billion-plus users.
01:53:05.773 iOS has one billion-plus users.
01:53:08.133 So they can't reallychange the product that much.
01:53:10.013 If you change the product,a lot of people are gonna be confused.
01:53:13.093 They have too many users.
01:53:14.533 And it's very profitable.
01:53:15.773 They're making a lot of moneyon the software and the services.
01:53:18.733 I don't know the number for India,but in the US,
01:53:21.133 Apple makes $100 per yearon each iPhone user,
01:53:23.893 just on non-hardware stuff.
01:53:26.293 It's a very high margin.
01:53:29.413 It's very profitable. Very big.
01:53:31.933 Now the disruption moment is with GenAI
01:53:34.453 -and large language models.-[Amit] Correct.
01:53:36.373 If you look at the recent newsaround Apple,
01:53:38.373 they announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC.
01:53:42.173 And still today, almost a year later,
01:53:45.653 -there's nothing...-Still the same.
01:53:47.133 ...nothing there to use.
01:53:48.733 Now they are reshufflingtheir management team.
01:53:50.213 And this is like four years after ChatGPT.
01:53:54.093 It took a long time to implement this.
01:53:58.173 So I think, one,they're too big and too successful.
01:54:02.053 So then the question is, like,how do you disrupt?
01:54:04.493 Like, what is their biggest moat?
01:54:07.573 I think, at least for smartphones,
01:54:09.213 their biggest moatis their developer ecosystem, right?
01:54:12.213 If today we launch our own OSbased on Android or a fork of Android,
01:54:19.133 we don't have any apps on the phone,no app store, no apps,
01:54:22.853 nobody is gonna buy the product.
01:54:24.693 Like, I wanna use my apps.
01:54:27.453 But again, if you look at AI,
01:54:28.733 there's a disruption momentfor app development
01:54:30.693 because now with AI coding tools,
01:54:33.933 you just need to write what app you want,and then it shows up.
01:54:38.293 In the future, you can just speakwhat app you want into the phone,
01:54:40.773 and that app shows up.
01:54:42.013 So then that givesa smaller company like us
01:54:44.533 the ability to compete with iOS,
01:54:47.333 which has, I don't know,a million, two million apps already.
01:54:50.293 But we can empower every normal personto also be an app developer.
01:54:54.133 If you have an idea,you just speak your idea into the product.
01:54:57.573 Therefore, we can also quickly developour ecosystem of developers and apps.
01:55:03.573 So I think that's the main opportunitythat I see,
01:55:06.493 that a younger, more nimble companycan navigate a changing world way quicker.
01:55:13.213 And the big moment that's enablingall of this is the advancements in AI.
01:55:18.653 How else can AI present opportunities
01:55:22.733 if I were to want to build somethingin consumer electronics as a 25-year-old?
01:55:28.093 It's kind of like the personal computer.
01:55:31.893 The example of it enables youto manifest your creativity into reality.
01:55:38.493 The personal computer allows you to goto Photoshop, GarageBand, iMovie.
01:55:43.893 Now, creating stuff is easier than ever.
01:55:46.653 Like, we talked about creating apps.
01:55:48.773 You can create graphics,create advertising,
01:55:50.933 create content,create product design, code.
01:55:54.853 It's really, in one way, lowering the barto creativity being manifested.
01:56:00.133 [Rahul] I think that is one segmentwhich will...
01:56:01.613 Again, a great idea,you know, for all the youngsters.
01:56:05.533 For AI, in terms of training the models,you know,
01:56:09.173 we all see that you will needthese many GPUs,
01:56:12.373 you know, hundreds of GPUs,thousands of GPUs,
01:56:14.613 to train all your models and all.
01:56:15.733 I think all those things,you know, will change.
01:56:20.053 There will be a timewhere you will be able to train
01:56:22.293 the largest of the modelsusing one single server.
01:56:24.893 You will not need a farm of servers.
01:56:27.813 We have seen a trailerin form of DeepSeek already.
01:56:32.493 And I think very soon we'll...
01:56:36.053 What, you know, it impliesis that how it is going to change.
01:56:41.053 This means that the access to technologywill be massified.
01:56:46.733 Right now, it is with only a few peoplewho are working on these LLMs.
01:56:49.933 For example, running 405 billion tokens,
01:56:52.573 or now the new modelis 788 billion tokens,
01:56:56.613 which only big server farms can do.
01:56:59.213 But, once there is a technology
01:57:03.053 wherein within a single serveryou'll be able to--
01:57:05.213 You can run your models.
01:57:07.893 I think, then all the youngsters,and they are way more creative,
01:57:12.973 they will be able to come up with,for example, an operating system.
01:57:15.573 They can just come up with an OSand then...
01:57:19.293 and figure it out.
01:57:20.573 Maybe then find a MrBeast and say,"Okay, hey, I have this."
01:57:24.413 And then, so...
01:57:26.493 But, there will be numerous opportunitiescoming out of that once it is massified.
01:57:30.893 One trend that I see in the market
01:57:33.413 is the youth of today does not want to buyfrom the corporations of yesterday.
01:57:39.373 I feel like things like Louis Vuitton,Gucci are not cool today
01:57:45.213 like they might have been ten years ago.
01:57:47.253 Everybody wants streetwear,the new independent brand--
01:57:51.653 Look at how you are dressed, for example.
01:57:54.773 Do you think there is a play there?
01:57:56.173 If I start a consumer electronic company
01:58:00.333 where I will use the narrativeof not a corporation?
01:58:08.173 [Carl] I think there is an opportunity,
01:58:10.013 but I think you would first need to startin a different category.
01:58:13.693 Like, make a fashion brand,make that successful.
01:58:16.493 Then you have the credibility
01:58:18.013 to go to the consumerelectronics suppliers
01:58:20.973 to get them to want to work with you.
01:58:22.933 'Cause they have seen so many...
01:58:24.813 These guys have seen so many failuresand so many pitches.
01:58:27.333 They are very pragmatic.
01:58:29.773 That is an interesting idea.
01:58:31.213 So, you are saying
01:58:33.293 start an independent design-themed brand,
01:58:38.813 start elsewhere,succeed and then transition into this?
01:58:42.013 You have to have volume.
01:58:43.533 That is the core of the consumerelectronics industry.
01:58:46.333 To be able to work with these suppliers
01:58:48.493 you need to show the numbersthat they can believe in.
01:58:51.653 So, look at our case.
01:58:53.573 We did not come from electronicsor consumer electronics background.
01:58:57.253 So, in my wildest dreamI could have never thought of
01:59:01.573 working in a space which is led bymobility brands or other brands.
01:59:05.493 So, we started with mobile accessories.
01:59:07.973 It's like...I still say it is a T-shirt business.
01:59:10.213 It is just simple cases.
01:59:11.853 You just print designsand designs are a character.
01:59:14.973 And we started understanding the user,consumer pattern,
01:59:18.253 and knowing and started building volumes.
01:59:20.693 Our partners saw a confidence in us, like,
01:59:23.373 "They are doing good volumes.We could test something with them."
01:59:26.533 So, maybe our entry alsowas not on day one here.
01:59:29.093 We learnt consumer from a basic business.
01:59:33.693 But, by the way,I have a very fundamental question
01:59:36.053 which I have realised as a founder.
01:59:39.133 What is the segment of the marketyou want to chase?
01:59:42.853 Like, what customer you want to...
01:59:45.053 I am asking you that question.
01:59:46.733 I don't have data like you have.
01:59:48.493 No, it is not about what I want.
01:59:52.893 It is about what you want to build.
01:59:54.373 I'll tell you for an example,the game what he is doing.
01:59:56.293 He is saying,I'll not fight the cheapest in the market,
01:59:58.453 like, he is not doing the Xiaomi play.
02:00:01.293 But what he is doing,
02:00:02.453 he is in the mid segment,which is super painful,
02:00:06.333 which needs time.
02:00:07.933 His gestation would be...Success will not be short term.
02:00:11.533 He would have a patience ofthree-to-four-year capital to build it.
02:00:15.213 And then he--
02:00:16.653 There are chances he might seeand might not see success.
02:00:19.173 So, as founders or whosoever,young people want to start,
02:00:23.093 they need to be very clearwhat segment they are trying to build.
02:00:26.453 Because different segment--When you talk about design--
02:00:28.733 What, if I come to you with a blank slate,
02:00:30.733 what segmentwould you recommend I build in?
02:00:32.493 No, if you ask me,I would say don't go for the mass.
02:00:35.653 Mass is important,but have some brand aspiration,
02:00:38.293 have your identity,have your brand uniqueness.
02:00:41.053 No point to fight for a commodity,that's a race to bottom.
02:00:43.893 You sell for $20,
02:00:46.173 somebody else will sell for 15, 12, 11.
02:00:49.333 Have your own community,
02:00:50.933 one narrow cohort of userswho you are selling,
02:00:53.373 and that community should beyour evangelist there.
02:00:57.213 And that always happens atsomewhere little above, not to the basics.
02:01:01.373 You are not solving basicsof anyone right now.
02:01:03.573 How does India build the supply chain?
02:01:05.533 Great.
02:01:07.813 So, it's a process.
02:01:10.013 So, the process is thatyou start with initially...
02:01:13.813 to start with EMS.
02:01:15.093 EMS is?
02:01:16.333 EMS is the electronic manufacturingservices that you start the EMS process.
02:01:22.413 Then you start getting the designout there in country.
02:01:28.133 Then after design, you start working onthe supply chain, the component ecosystem.
02:01:33.493 Right? So, this is...This all is a process one-by-one.
02:01:37.773 If I am 25 and I want to starta component company,
02:01:42.133 I've raised a little bit of money,put up a factory.
02:01:45.893 How will I ever competewith somebody in China
02:01:48.173 who's manufacturing millions of units?
02:01:50.213 So, you can do that.
02:01:52.173 So, there is so much of materialwhich goes inside.
02:01:55.053 For example, a glue on a glue machine,on SMT, it's a glue.
02:02:00.933 That glue--
02:02:02.053 So, I just found out that that glue,
02:02:03.653 the particular glueis still coming from China.
02:02:05.773 We can-- Why can't we make that here?
02:02:08.213 And I studied, I said why the chemicalcompanies can make that glue out there.
02:02:11.613 You can do that.
02:02:13.493 Probably there is--
02:02:14.573 Maybe somebody has to find outand get into that.
02:02:19.773 I know someone, you know, who said, "Okay,
02:02:21.813 after finishing my engineering,what should I do and all?"
02:02:24.733 And then went on searchthat what India is importing a lot
02:02:28.333 and he found outall the coin's material...
02:02:31.973 Right? For the coins, currency coins,the material, we still import.
02:02:35.573 He started making that,he started supplying that.
02:02:38.093 So, you just...
02:02:39.253 Is that an opportunity for me?
02:02:40.733 I think US will, in the tariff world,not buy from China like they once did.
02:02:45.333 Components is a huge opportunity.
02:02:47.093 So, for example, now India is projectinga market of 500 billion dollars by 2030.
02:02:51.573 It's a huge market.
02:02:53.533 60% of that is components.
02:02:55.333 And we are also incentivised to usethe locally manufactured components.
02:02:59.533 If manufacturing is coming here,
02:03:00.933 100% components will come here,like batteries...
02:03:03.813 -That's an opportunity, too.-100%.
02:03:05.733 Like, I want to make money,I'm 25, in this industry.
02:03:08.253 -Component is part of---EMS is a...
02:03:09.813 I think next ten years is EMS. So...
02:03:13.253 And the component PLI scheme is coming.
02:03:14.893 Maybe by the time this podcast is out,the scheme will be announced.
02:03:17.493 How do I go about starting that?
02:03:19.013 Let's say an EMS company,an EMS manufacturer.
02:03:22.293 Great. So, take a mobile phone,get into each and every component.
02:03:26.173 There are so many. There are--
02:03:27.853 So, in a mobile phone, there are,let's say, 700-800 components.
02:03:31.013 Maybe in his phone, maybe it will be more.
02:03:32.693 iPhone will be way more, right?
02:03:34.853 Get into that.
02:03:35.933 How do I find that out?Like, I want to know...
02:03:39.653 I'm assuming US, Chinaare going to hate each other
02:03:41.653 for some time more.
02:03:43.813 Apple phones are made in the US.
02:03:45.613 They can't buy that particular productthat they have been, from China anymore.
02:03:50.533 How do I figure out what that component isand then how to build it?
02:03:54.333 Just tear it down.
02:03:56.293 Nikhil, these days,it is actually simpler.
02:03:58.213 You know, you go on ChatGPT.
02:04:00.493 There are so many sites on the Internet
02:04:02.013 where you could just seetear down of every phone.
02:04:03.813 Tear down, you can find outwhat are the components
02:04:05.813 and then you find out, okay,how many components are there in India.
02:04:08.013 Go on the export list, import listthat what all are getting in the country.
02:04:12.333 Right? What is the volume? What is the--
02:04:14.413 These days, you can get accessto all the customs data easily.
02:04:16.773 [Amit] Yeah.
02:04:17.853 So, huge opportunity.
02:04:20.693 You should also work at EMS to get some...industry knowledge.
02:04:24.533 -Experience. Yeah.-[Carl] Experience.
02:04:26.493 There is somebody working with himfor a year.
02:04:28.613 He would know everythingwhere this opportunity lies.
02:04:32.013 How big is the incentivefor someone like Carl?
02:04:34.053 Say, you are selling Nothing phonesin India.
02:04:36.453 You source from me in Bangalore
02:04:38.613 versus a Chinese component manufacturer.
02:04:42.173 Is the incentive enoughto warrant the change in price?
02:04:48.093 So, right now, we have to payduties on components
02:04:51.813 that are sourcedfrom other countries like China.
02:04:54.293 So the more we can source locally,
02:04:55.653 the more we can lowerthe prices of our product
02:04:58.533 to then be more competitive on the market.
02:05:00.613 So, we are very incentivised.
02:05:02.533 And if we are able to tap into PLI,
02:05:04.733 and I think the PLI regulation
02:05:06.373 will also be more and more requiringof the brands to source locally.
02:05:12.093 And they will raise the barevery single year.
02:05:16.333 We are very incentivisedto source locally.
02:05:18.813 As a business, we just need to makethe best decision for our shareholders.
02:05:22.533 So, till now you have told me,go to ChatGPT, figure out...
02:05:26.253 No, no, just...
02:05:28.013 Just as I said, these days,there are a lot of avenues
02:05:31.213 where you can go and find outmultiple sort of information.
02:05:34.293 Right. So, I figure out one component
02:05:36.253 which is going intoUS cell phone manufacturer
02:05:38.973 which is coming from China.
02:05:41.133 And then I go about figuring if thatraw material is available in India.
02:05:46.093 I identify that there is.
02:05:48.133 What do I do nextto set up a factory which makes it?
02:05:52.293 Okay, let's take an example.
02:05:55.173 Carl, can I use your phone?
02:06:00.533 Let's say this is a USB socket.
02:06:02.333 [Nikhil] Yeah.
02:06:03.413 This USB socket isthe most abused component here
02:06:09.333 because, let's say a million timesyou are going to...
02:06:13.213 Right? So, this means to say that
02:06:15.373 this will requirea special sort of material.
02:06:17.773 Study that material.
02:06:19.133 Where that material is available?
02:06:21.333 Who is manufacturing it?
02:06:23.053 At what cost?
02:06:25.133 And absolutely go to the root of that.
02:06:30.213 And then see what are the...
02:06:33.333 If you can go and visit these factories
02:06:36.573 by tapping someone,getting into a network--
02:06:40.453 These factories in China?
02:06:42.373 Wherever. Wherever. If possible.
02:06:45.413 See, and then understand the standards.
02:06:48.413 See, why this is not happening?
02:06:49.693 Why I gave you a glue example?
02:06:50.933 Because people said,"No, India can't make that."
02:06:52.653 Why can't we make that?
02:06:53.733 We are fantastic in chemical--
02:06:55.453 Our chemical industry,our pharmaceutical industry,
02:06:57.133 they are doing brilliantly well.
02:06:59.453 Probably there is maybe,there is not awareness of that,
02:07:02.173 or the volumes and everything,
02:07:03.853 but I think if we are going to go,
02:07:05.933 let's say from 100 billionto 500 billion dollars,
02:07:09.133 it's a massive opportunity.
02:07:10.613 Similarly here.
02:07:12.413 What else can be done?
02:07:13.933 Like, see, the outcome of this is we want,
02:07:17.413 even if it's five kids who start...
02:07:22.213 solving for the supply chain problemdependency that we are talking about,
02:07:27.293 if that is the go-to action that happensbecause of the time we have spent today,
02:07:31.733 I think we can all say today was worth it.
02:07:34.773 Also, like, we spoke--
02:07:37.133 And I think we will need5,000 of those kids
02:07:38.933 because it's a huge universe.
02:07:42.253 And we don't have it here.
02:07:43.653 We have to bring it in.
02:07:45.253 [Nikhil] Yeah.
02:07:46.533 And, by the way, brands like us
02:07:48.493 are desperately looking for peopleto do it for us.
02:07:51.613 I mean, it's our need also.
02:07:52.853 What is the biggest need?Say two things that you want me--
02:07:55.413 Let's say for us, for an example,
02:07:57.453 in watches we do,the largest component is the screen.
02:08:00.053 The screen is like $5 or something.
02:08:02.573 And if I import, there is a 15% duty,
02:08:05.933 which means every screenI am paying, what?
02:08:08.413 One and a half-- Close to $1.
02:08:11.253 If you say, make it in India,it's a huge volume.
02:08:14.333 It's maybe half a million,one million screens a month.
02:08:16.693 What is the margin in screen business?
02:08:19.173 I'm sure if we cost arbitrage,if you look at it,
02:08:21.773 it still makes 10% or 7%.
02:08:24.853 It's just one SKU,you have to keep producing.
02:08:27.293 Oh, you know the smartphone screensfrom China,
02:08:31.253 those companies are losing moneyto sell the screens.
02:08:34.293 Because they have policies that subsidisethe creation of that industry.
02:08:38.653 So, at least for the smartphone screens,it's very hard for...
02:08:41.773 So you're saying our import duty has to behigher than their subsidy, at the least?
02:08:47.533 At the least, if-- Yeah. Yeah.
02:08:50.493 So, one is import duty,
02:08:52.133 and second, of course,the PLI schemes coming on components
02:08:55.213 will incentiviseto use more Make In India.
02:08:57.693 Any advice to the government,
02:08:59.053 because I'm suresomebody will be watching.
02:09:00.893 How should the PLI scheme be structuredfor components?
02:09:04.213 It's already structured.
02:09:05.293 It's just going to be announcedin two-three days.
02:09:06.773 -He would be a part of it.-[Rahul] So...
02:09:09.773 It's a good scheme.
02:09:11.413 Yes, it's a good scheme.
02:09:13.853 It's a good scheme.
02:09:15.973 But see, the larger point here is...
02:09:19.493 that you have to ensurethat locally-made products
02:09:23.973 make more sense for anybody who wants to,
02:09:26.453 you know, who's selling,let's say, in India.
02:09:28.613 I'm not even talking about export.
02:09:30.613 If Carl wants to buy a,let's say, a middle frame,
02:09:35.933 he should be able to source it locallyand it should be cheaper for him,
02:09:39.933 not because he's forcedbecause of a regulation.
02:09:43.613 It should also make sense economicallyfor him to do that.
02:09:47.173 And that, in today's world,because of scale,
02:09:49.413 it can only happen with custom dutyor the tariff.
02:09:54.773 So, tariff-- No--
02:09:55.853 -Depending on the component.-Yes.
02:09:57.333 I think plasticshould be very easy, right?
02:09:59.933 -To replicate here.-Yes.
02:10:02.293 Plastic, and second, as I said,the government incentive schemes.
02:10:06.813 Because, you know,if you see how China was built,
02:10:08.933 because ofall the government schemes only.
02:10:11.933 And why their exports went up
02:10:13.293 because their export schemes are,like, massive.
02:10:15.213 You three continue talking.
02:10:16.733 Like, I'm a 25-year-old.
02:10:18.133 I'm trying to learn from three stalwartsof our consumer electronic industry.
02:10:24.213 I want to make money. End goal.
02:10:27.893 The biggest moneymaker is, like...
02:10:30.653 The industries with fewer competitors,right? Like NVIDIA.
02:10:35.213 If you look at the NVIDIA share price,it's insane.
02:10:37.733 Taking a huge example.
02:10:38.813 But even for our industry, like,I think the chipset makers,
02:10:42.453 their margins are way higherthan the EMS factories, right?
02:10:46.293 NVIDIA, I don't know, is it 40--
02:10:48.773 Qualcomm is 40, 60--
02:10:50.053 They're 45%, I think,they just declared, yeah.
02:10:52.093 [Carl] 45% gross margin.
02:10:53.373 But Foxconn is, I think, 10%. So...
02:10:57.533 Like, eventually we also have to moveupmarket, right,
02:11:00.093 into, like, more and more difficult,lower competition areas of the stack.
02:11:06.053 Yes, but, Carl, again,
02:11:08.773 Nikhil's point is that how do we inspirethe young generation out here
02:11:13.053 to start doing something?
02:11:14.453 You know, how do they spot opportunities?
02:11:16.093 Yeah.
02:11:17.173 So, as I said, if you tear down the phone,what are the easiest five things,
02:11:22.493 ten things you can just pick up and say,"Hey, this I can do.
02:11:25.893 That is a little-- Is not that complex."
02:11:30.373 By the way, you know, he's right.
02:11:33.413 You know, so making these mechanics,
02:11:37.653 for example,precision mechanics is not that easy.
02:11:41.653 We still, you know, a lot of thingsare getting imported,
02:11:43.773 even on precision mechanics.
02:11:44.933 -Yeah?-[Rahul] Yeah.
02:11:47.413 But once there area lot of incentives and all,
02:11:49.333 we have ample people herewho can take a shot at that.
02:11:53.853 I'm curious to hear, like,how does the next Qualcomm...
02:11:59.173 Like, if a kid is watching this,like, say, 30 years later,
02:12:03.853 they've created Qualcomm,the next Qualcomm.
02:12:05.813 Like, how does that path happen?
02:12:08.013 So, you know, Carl, you just straight awaytalking about a moonshot.
02:12:13.213 But instead of a Qualcomm, one Qualcomm,
02:12:17.053 I'm saying, can we make, for example,
02:12:21.653 if I have to take an exampleof automobile,
02:12:24.133 let's say, in terms of components,
02:12:25.333 can we make 300 or 500 Mindas here?
02:12:30.453 Minda is a good example, you know.
02:12:32.453 -Auto is all making money.-[Rahul] Yeah.
02:12:37.733 -Makes sense.-Yeah.
02:12:38.813 I think that's a very large opportunity,knocking on our door.
02:12:42.373 How much money would I need to starta factory around, say, the USB port?
02:12:47.013 I think it will be very less, right?
02:12:49.693 [Amit] For USB port.
02:12:50.773 It's not easy.
02:12:53.093 -You would know it the best.-[Rahul] Yeah, it's a...
02:12:57.693 You know, Molly and all,
02:12:58.853 they are like specialised Europeanswho are working on this.
02:13:04.333 But again, it was just an example.
02:13:07.413 But once you go inside, Nikhil,as I said, you can find out...
02:13:12.653 For example, inside there is a...
02:13:15.693 You have battery.On battery to dissipate the heat,
02:13:19.773 you need some mechanismto dissipate the heat.
02:13:22.533 You need a graphene,small film of graphene,
02:13:24.653 which you can put,which can dissipate the heat.
02:13:26.253 You can make it here.
02:13:28.893 It will go in every phone.
02:13:31.933 So, I am not saying straight awayyou go and target,
02:13:33.493 okay, I am going to make the nextSony camera or something like that.
02:13:36.373 And the PLI schemewill incentivise all of this?
02:13:40.413 So, as of now,they have structured it for,
02:13:42.853 let's say,components which are high in value,
02:13:45.773 let's say, which cover 70% to 75%of the mobile phone.
02:13:50.573 These are all B2B businesses then.
02:13:52.373 I mean, everybody hasa different inclination
02:13:54.813 towards what they want to build.
02:13:57.333 No, anything is fine.
02:13:58.813 I just want to build somethingin this space
02:14:01.053 where I can actually make money.
02:14:04.133 Is there financing available?
02:14:05.533 Let's say, I figure out a certain productwhich is under PLI that I start building.
02:14:13.533 But I don't have too much initial capital.
02:14:16.133 How does one go aroundgetting that initial funding?
02:14:19.773 If I come up with a business plan
02:14:21.213 and come to somebody like Rahul,will you give it?
02:14:23.333 Yes, if I see that your product works,
02:14:28.253 working as per the standards, and then...
02:14:30.933 Would a bank give it?
02:14:32.493 I think yes.But, of course, banks work on collaterals.
02:14:34.893 I don't have collateral.
02:14:36.013 There are a few banks who might,you know...
02:14:37.693 Is there some startup scheme,some government subsidy,
02:14:41.213 where I can get the initial capital?
02:14:42.413 Yes, you can. There are multiple schemes.
02:14:44.133 Again, yeah. Very good point.
02:14:45.613 There are so many schemeswhich people are not even aware of.
02:14:48.413 For example, for MSME sector,
02:14:51.213 you know,from Invest India, from Startup India,
02:14:54.253 there are multiple schemes going onwhich people are not even aware of.
02:14:58.053 I am not aware. How do I find out?
02:15:00.333 You will have to make this much effort.
02:15:02.133 Then you need to go after that
02:15:03.813 and find outhow many schemes are available
02:15:05.493 and then one by one...
02:15:06.933 Which one applies to me.
02:15:08.293 Yes. For example,there is a PLI everybody knows,
02:15:11.293 but there is a DLI,which is design-led incentive
02:15:14.093 for the chipsets and all.
02:15:16.373 You should know that.
02:15:18.693 There is a grant for that.
02:15:20.493 You need to show your designs.
02:15:21.693 Government, you know, they will come,inspect and see what you are doing
02:15:25.373 and then you can do that.
02:15:27.693 For a right idea, you will knock on100 doors, one door will open.
02:15:34.893 But you need-- You need to knock.
02:15:38.733 You just can't say, okay...
02:15:41.053 As you also said,either a bank will come up
02:15:43.213 or a VC will come upor a government scheme will come up.
02:15:46.453 Something will come up for a right idea.
02:15:48.493 I was reading this thing.
02:15:49.973 Somebody had sent me an emailsaying semiconductors,
02:15:52.653 something drastic is happening in India.
02:15:55.173 Is that a possibility?
02:15:57.773 "Drastic" means?
02:15:59.013 Like, so the backstory goesthat at one point,
02:16:03.453 India was really focusedon semiconductors.
02:16:05.893 There was one particular factorywhich burned down.
02:16:08.973 But in the last 20 years,
02:16:10.733 we have been left behindor 30 years we have been left behind,
02:16:13.213 and they are restarting the effort...
02:16:16.133 to manufacturemore semiconductors in India.
02:16:19.093 Is that possible?
02:16:21.413 With TSMC and all of that?
02:16:23.173 The whole world is relying on them, right?
02:16:25.093 You mean like start a new TSMCor get TSMC to...
02:16:28.253 Like both semiconductor designand manufacturing. Can I--
02:16:31.493 -So you can't create a TSMC...-[Nikhil] Can you compete?
02:16:33.813 I think it comes down to, like,the depth of the thing, right?
02:16:36.973 Like how many millimetre...
02:16:38.612 So we are working in one of the companieson semiconductors.
02:16:40.852 And what you're referring is,there was one fab in India,
02:16:45.293 only one fab which was in Mohali,government owned, long back...
02:16:48.612 [Nikhil] Yes.
02:16:49.692 Doing probably, you know,
02:16:54.173 100 nanometres or something like that.
02:16:55.893 Today TSMC is doing two nanometres.
02:16:58.612 Two-three, correct.
02:16:59.973 So, of course, I mean,you can't catch up with two nanometre.
02:17:02.733 Even, see, China started theirsemiconductor programme 20 years back.
02:17:06.413 They are still not ableto compete on that.
02:17:08.293 But it is very, very important.
02:17:10.772 All four of us, like, 15 years back or so,
02:17:15.653 have you ever thought thatsemiconductor will be more valuable
02:17:19.493 or important than oil?
02:17:20.852 Not even a thought came across to my mind.
02:17:23.973 Back then.
02:17:25.173 But if you see today, it is.
02:17:27.852 And I am assuming the same thing.I am assuming US, China continue to fight.
02:17:32.293 And Taiwan becomes...
02:17:35.973 I don't know,maybe our friend in that fight
02:17:37.813 or maybe not our friend.
02:17:39.333 If our supply chain gets disrupted
02:17:41.653 where we can't get those2mm semiconductors,
02:17:44.692 what does India do then?
02:17:46.413 It is a tough question because,you know, it is divided in multiple parts.
02:17:50.333 So it is not only about two nanometres.
02:17:51.653 Two nanometre is only one segment.Then you have--
02:17:53.933 So, government is saying, you start with,
02:17:55.813 let's say 35 nanometres right now,is good enough.
02:17:59.053 Because you have to start coming slowlyone by one. Right?
02:18:02.933 So even that, you know,if we can start at 35,
02:18:08.373 because those are larger components,which can go into you know, other things.
02:18:13.772 You know, refrigerators, TVs,vacuums, cars and all.
02:18:20.093 And then slowly, slowly you start comingin for the ITs and the mobile phones.
02:18:25.333 But at least we start attacking the,you know, the 35, 40 nanometres,
02:18:30.573 25 nanometres, start attacking that.
02:18:33.813 So that is the opportunity.
02:18:34.973 I mean, straight away, you know,you can't leapfrog.
02:18:37.532 As I said, China has putbillions and billions of dollars
02:18:40.493 and still they are not ableto achieve that.
02:18:42.053 And there are--Again, it's a country play.
02:18:45.452 A company can't build something like this.
02:18:48.532 Country, you know, has to come into it.
02:18:51.253 For example, to do a,
02:18:54.413 let's say,anything less than 10 nanometres,
02:18:56.333 you need to have lithography.
02:18:57.692 What is that?
02:18:58.852 It's a machine. It's a technology.
02:19:01.213 That technology is right nowwith Holland, Netherlands.
02:19:07.933 There is a company...This company name is...
02:19:12.173 -ASML.-ASML.
02:19:13.293 No competitors.
02:19:14.373 So, ASML has those machines.
02:19:15.852 You need to have access to that.
02:19:18.692 In those machines, the softwareactually is coming from the United States.
02:19:21.573 So it's a-- It's all a--
02:19:23.573 Because it's a game where you need towork on this technology
02:19:27.293 and need to stabilise the technology.
02:19:28.733 So the government has to comeand play into that.
02:19:31.013 So, it's way more deeperthan what we feel. Because, you know--
02:19:35.813 But, you know,semiconductor is a vast range.
02:19:38.772 It's not only that, only doing a TSMC,
02:19:41.093 because when we talk about semiconductors,you know, we always talk about TSMC.
02:19:46.293 Memory.
02:19:47.373 Why can't India have its own memory?
02:19:49.533 Can we design our own?
02:19:52.053 Let's, for example, in your IT,
02:19:53.973 there is Gen 4, there is Gen 5,now there is Gen 6.
02:19:58.453 Why can't India come up with,
02:19:59.853 I'm talking about, let's say,Gen 8 or Gen 9?
02:20:02.653 End of the day, you have to have that.
02:20:05.973 So these are all opportunities--
02:20:07.973 I'll ask you a questionon top of your question only.
02:20:09.893 Why is it not happening?
02:20:11.493 Because in India,we were good in services.
02:20:14.213 So we were--Our services sector was doing good.
02:20:16.493 So people said, okay,let's build on the services business.
02:20:19.613 So if you see all these Gen 4, 5,
02:20:22.493 half of their manpowerwill be sitting in Bangalore and Hyderabad
02:20:25.733 and designing for the other bigger brands
02:20:28.453 who are somewhere in USor other countries.
02:20:33.853 But not for us.
02:20:35.453 Because A, we were not havingthose government programmes earlier.
02:20:38.653 They were not, right--
02:20:41.253 Not focused on creatingsomething like that.
02:20:44.493 So, where the buck was going was,
02:20:46.853 okay, services is an easy business,let's go there.
02:20:50.733 Half of the people working on thosetechnologies will be from India.
02:20:54.853 He was talking about Qualcomm or MTK,their biggest R&D centres are in India.
02:20:59.293 -Mm?-Yes.
02:21:02.213 So the focus--
02:21:03.813 But now we have, you know,with the current government,
02:21:06.733 all the new schemes coming in,
02:21:10.133 people are becoming more aware of that.
02:21:13.573 See, today we are discussingabout semiconductors.
02:21:16.453 Otherwise, if it was a consumer brandor electronics and that,
02:21:19.773 why will we be discussingabout semiconductors?
02:21:22.133 Because now, all of us,because of the policies and everything,
02:21:24.893 and whatever happened,we are more aware of that.
02:21:28.813 You are doing a bunch ofvery new things, right?
02:21:31.773 Like with television, operating software.
02:21:34.773 There is one companythat we are both part of.
02:21:38.533 -Around television, as well.-Yeah.
02:21:40.053 What's happening in that world?Would you like to tell us?
02:21:42.533 No, that's more on the aggregation,
02:21:45.013 because the way we consume contentis completely changing.
02:21:48.613 Can you tell us your thesis around that?
02:21:51.253 Thesis is that, you know,you buy a product,
02:21:53.853 and then you start getting multiple apps,
02:21:56.933 and then you start paying different apps.
02:22:02.933 Then your user experience is then,
02:22:05.653 that whatever recommendationone is showing something else,
02:22:08.213 the other is showing ussome different recommendation,
02:22:10.773 third is showing something else.
02:22:12.373 Why can't I have an experiencewherein I switch on my TV,
02:22:17.013 and then I don't have to go in any app?
02:22:19.293 There is one user interface,and all the apps are stitched into that.
02:22:23.933 You just type in your,let's say, username.
02:22:28.013 Let's say nikhil@gmail.com,
02:22:31.093 and then everything from your Netflixto your Zee to your Sony,
02:22:36.653 as per your choice and recommendation,everything starts coming on one screen.
02:22:39.933 You're not going in an app.
02:22:43.133 That's one area-- Because again,it's an evolving space.
02:22:47.933 And then you bundle italong with the hardware piece,
02:22:50.213 wherein you move on a SaaS model.
02:22:53.293 How do you...
02:22:55.453 I'm pretty interestedin this business model,
02:22:56.933 because as a content platform,you don't want to be unbundled, right?
02:23:00.893 You want your own app,your own user experience.
02:23:03.293 Yes.
02:23:04.373 How do you get their stuff?
02:23:06.133 Like, it's not in their incentiveto unbundle their content.
02:23:10.253 Like, you're saying,how do you get access to that content?
02:23:12.733 Yeah, for instance, Netflix.
02:23:13.813 If I'm Netflix, and you say,you just want to take the content...
02:23:16.493 Apart from Netflix,you take some other example,
02:23:18.453 because that'sa different animal altogether.
02:23:20.293 -Hotstar.-Let's say Hotstar, yeah.
02:23:22.813 So, I have my own app,I have my own users,
02:23:25.693 I don't want to give you my content,
02:23:27.053 because then I losemy competitive advantage.
02:23:30.173 Then my content becomes a commodityon your platform.
02:23:33.333 So, I mean, the platform,the content, the platforms,
02:23:36.773 they will try and hedgeagainst this, right?
02:23:40.613 So, if there are like, say, 25 apps,
02:23:42.693 which are the most widely used appsout there,
02:23:46.013 and out of 25, 90% of the apps,
02:23:49.373 you're able to get inside the app
02:23:52.573 and get the permission for recommendationand everything.
02:23:57.493 And then, you know,put it on your screen for the user.
02:24:01.293 I think it's acceptable.
02:24:03.773 -So, for them, it's like incremental.-Yes.
02:24:06.333 If I don't work with you,I won't make this money.
02:24:08.533 Might as well make the money.
02:24:09.653 -Because they also need distribution.-Yeah.
02:24:13.013 So, then you have a few big onesthat are harder to negotiate with.
02:24:16.733 They will come with scale.
02:24:18.453 So, once you achieve scale,they will say, "All right."
02:24:20.813 -"We also want this."-I get it.
02:24:22.893 It's a bit likecell phone and app store, right?
02:24:25.773 Yeah.
02:24:27.893 So, when there's a new OSon the cell phone,
02:24:30.933 the big app makersare not going to adopt, right?
02:24:34.053 They're going to wait for the distributionto come first.
02:24:37.413 So, I think it's about that adoption.
02:24:39.293 Yeah.
02:24:40.693 But when you bundle,I think it gets cheaper.
02:24:42.773 Yeah.
02:24:45.093 Why don't you guys speaklike I'm not in the room
02:24:47.053 and there are no cameras?
02:24:49.373 Yeah, isn't... We're trying to.
02:24:51.173 [laughter]
02:24:52.253 Carl, what opportunity existsin the consumer market besides phones?
02:24:56.773 What do I want to have exist?
02:24:58.453 No. I mean,what are the opportunities which--
02:25:00.853 Oh, what opportunities exist?
02:25:02.133 Not for the large players.
02:25:04.493 I'm only thinking about, like,very big categories all the time.
02:25:08.733 I'm thinking about, like,EVs and robotics stuff.
02:25:14.173 But I agree, like, if you're young,
02:25:15.893 you have to start with somethingmore simple.
02:25:19.453 [Nikhil] What is China like?
02:25:20.613 What else do you think we can learnas a country from them?
02:25:25.533 I don't spend a lot of timethinking about policy.
02:25:27.813 But I do think the PLI is set up...
02:25:29.813 You probably know moreabout PLI than me, but...
02:25:34.333 We are very keen to be a partof the next generation PLI scheme.
02:25:41.413 I think if India wants to developits own smartphone ecosystem,
02:25:45.453 starting from the factory,EMS side is very good.
02:25:48.253 That's already happening.
02:25:50.013 Incentivising foreign and domestic playersto build here.
02:25:54.053 It's already happening.
02:25:55.933 I think to reach the next stage,
02:25:57.613 it can't just bemanufacturing and exports.
02:26:01.533 Because ultimately,that's not the highest value add.
02:26:04.453 The next stage will be to designand engineer here as well.
02:26:07.813 So, what is the next stage policy
02:26:10.093 after the goal of PLIhas been accomplished?
02:26:13.933 What is the next stage plan? I'm not sure.
02:26:15.933 I'm just starting to spend more timeand learn more about this.
02:26:19.973 So, I think, to your question that,what can we do?
02:26:23.293 If you see what they have donein last 25 years,
02:26:26.653 in terms ofall the government policies, so...
02:26:31.253 We are discussing about incentivising,that is one.
02:26:33.893 That is one incentive.
02:26:35.653 But rest of the other enablers,
02:26:37.173 for example, the whole supply chainin terms of materials and everything,
02:26:42.493 they have workeda lot deeper on that segment.
02:26:45.693 In terms of logistics,
02:26:48.133 they have created logistics parksto enable that.
02:26:51.773 Today, if we are talking about,for example, now we have,
02:26:56.573 let's say, iPhones going and exportingand doing all this sort of things.
02:27:01.693 The way we are expanding,you will need two full, bigger, you know,
02:27:07.653 large aircrafts every weekto ferry the product from here to Chicago.
02:27:13.893 We need to have that.
02:27:15.893 We need to, you know, build bigger ports,
02:27:19.173 wherein you can reduce the time.
02:27:21.213 Because they have taken all that measures,not only in one segment,
02:27:24.373 because we talk only about this,
02:27:25.693 but every segment,they have done with all those policies.
02:27:30.613 I think consumer electronicsis a very expensive
02:27:35.653 and difficult thingfor somebody without experience.
02:27:38.453 -All of a sudden going---Experience is key, I believe.
02:27:41.133 Without that you can't do.
02:27:43.173 In fact, you can't do also,I personally think.
02:27:45.333 [Nikhil] You're making dessert?
02:27:47.253 -Yeah---[Amit] Doing is expensive only.
02:27:49.413 I mean, you will 100% make mistakes.
02:27:52.133 I think we found a couple of themes,you know, where people could start.
02:27:55.733 Something more focused,something more niche,
02:27:58.373 lower risk, lower capex.
02:28:00.853 Start from there, evolve from there.
02:28:02.693 It could be on the consumer side,with clothing or accessories.
02:28:07.373 It could be on the supply chain side
02:28:09.133 with parts of the stackthat are easier to make.
02:28:14.133 And then just evolve from there.
02:28:15.973 It could be on the distribution side
02:28:17.853 with content creationas a means of distributing information.
02:28:22.613 But, Rahul, what is your thought?
02:28:24.573 We have seen all brands across the globecoming to India in consumer electronics.
02:28:31.373 Hardly there are brands who have gone out.
02:28:33.173 -To have gone?-To have gone outside India.
02:28:36.013 -Indian brands?-Yeah, Indian brands.
02:28:38.653 Forget Southeast Asian countriesfor a while.
02:28:41.733 But none of the brands have gone outsideour home turf and played a game there.
02:28:46.653 Do you think world needssome new age brands?
02:28:50.893 I have solid thesis for that.
02:28:54.373 So, I personally thinkIndia as a country...
02:28:57.733 I mean we all work with scarcity mindset.
02:28:59.813 So, what has happened that,
02:29:01.253 what a US or an European entrepreneur
02:29:03.653 would try to solve a problemby throwing a dollar.
02:29:07.413 A dollar is 90 rupees for us.
02:29:09.653 So, what I'm trying to say,for us every penny counts.
02:29:12.533 And for somethingwhat they are producing for $100,
02:29:16.053 a similar great quality product,
02:29:17.973 Indian entrepreneur could build for,let's say 30-40% cheaper than them.
02:29:25.333 We have captive consumption.
02:29:28.933 Entrepreneurs now are very smart,
02:29:30.533 they are very evolved,travelled, done across.
02:29:34.093 Why can't we take that arbitrageand take these brands to the globe?
02:29:38.733 I mean, we are good at marketingby the way, Indian entrepreneur.
02:29:41.293 Software, we are good at.
02:29:43.253 Hardware, we can learn from our peers.
02:29:46.573 Why can't Indian brands--
02:29:47.973 Why can't we build brandswho are based out of India
02:29:52.373 and move to global scale?
02:29:55.133 There are no brands existing everywhere,there are old traditional brands.
02:29:59.133 -It's starting now, right?-Yeah.
02:30:01.293 With you guys.
02:30:02.373 [Amit] So,that's what we are trying to do.
02:30:04.813 We believe thatit is a right platform for us.
02:30:08.093 We have gained decent experience
02:30:10.853 and international marketswe could do justice.
02:30:14.253 But I'm generally talking.
02:30:16.133 We need more brands. One brand can't do.
02:30:18.373 I mean, I have seen we all buyinginternational brands.
02:30:21.173 Are you talking about-- You want meto answer in consumer electronics?
02:30:23.853 I am talking about consumer electronics,specifically, yeah.
02:30:26.533 In consumer electronics,
02:30:28.053 you can go into those marketswhere your products are relevant.
02:30:33.493 -Bang on.-[Rahul] Okay?
02:30:35.053 So, for example, in Indian demographics,whatever products you are making,
02:30:38.773 you are going to take the same productbecause you have scale and you go there.
02:30:42.533 So, that's what I am saying. So, when...
02:30:45.733 I mean, I want to cater to a marketwhich is, let's say, mid.
02:30:50.293 Because I don't want a cheapest product.
02:30:52.253 -Which is fine. So---[Amit] Indian demographic.
02:30:54.533 So, those products you have taken intothose similar categories and similar...
02:31:00.053 -you know, geographies.-[Amit] Yeah.
02:31:01.773 -That you can do.-[Amit] Yeah.
02:31:03.933 Southeast Asia, all other, you know,so, for example, all the SAARC countries,
02:31:08.133 then this side, Russia, Eastern Europe.
02:31:10.893 These are fantastic markets.
02:31:12.333 -[Amit] Yeah.-Right?
02:31:14.133 Then second, if you are sayingthat you want to hit the upper deck.
02:31:19.613 I am just staying middle.
02:31:21.173 See, upper, I am very clear.
02:31:22.973 Let Sony, Samsung play the gamewhat they are playing, or Apple.
02:31:26.373 We don't want to touch them.
02:31:27.613 The consumers are very loyal.They have an ecosystem.
02:31:30.013 They have advantagesof whatever they could, so...
02:31:33.253 You already have a scale in India.
02:31:36.573 And then when you are going outside,you know, you go with that.
02:31:40.253 Same scale and cater to that.
02:31:42.573 Create one or two more brands.
02:31:46.733 And use--Leverage the scale what you have.
02:31:51.573 And, you know,you can attack the markets--
02:31:53.293 No, that's what I am saying, we can do it.
02:31:55.053 -India need those brands.-Yes.
02:31:57.613 We are just no moreabout basic necessity brand,
02:32:00.453 where we are just solving for features.
02:32:03.693 And you'll be surprised, I'll tell you,Rahul, where I'm coming from,
02:32:05.933 When we-- We just launched in Dubaiin Virgin stores.
02:32:10.173 Traditionally, Indian brands would havegone and launched a $20 product.
02:32:13.213 We launched ourselvesat $75 to $100 pricing.
02:32:16.453 And we're getting a great response.
02:32:18.213 I mean, look at the kind of responsepeople are giving
02:32:20.453 for a decent-price-point products.
02:32:22.973 -Again, innovation is one.-100%.
02:32:25.293 Innovation is needed.You can't enter a commodity space.
02:32:28.373 Innovation and then you can have--
02:32:30.133 Create different brands for,you know, different needs.
02:32:36.373 One brand can't serve all, that's true.
02:32:38.213 [Rahul] Look at...
02:32:39.533 Here you have OPPO, then you have OnePlus,then you have Realme.
02:32:43.213 Under one umbrella only.
02:32:44.333 -We have two brands.-[Rahul] Yeah.
02:32:46.653 He has to come up with CMF because...
02:32:48.453 -We need the scale.-Yeah.
02:32:50.373 The scale, 100% is needed.
02:32:51.973 I think you can build mid-marketwith the scale.
02:32:55.133 -Yeah.-Otherwise, nobody gonna support you.
02:32:58.053 Yeah.
02:32:59.133 But I think it's--
02:33:01.133 The Indian economyhas got into a point in time
02:33:03.373 where there's entrepreneurswith a skill-set to go global.
02:33:06.133 And it's already the language advantage,the language and culture advantage.
02:33:10.333 -It's easier to do marketing.-[Amit] Yeah.
02:33:12.093 Right? It's easier to do US or Europe.
02:33:16.493 But on the product definition side,
02:33:18.053 it's easier to go tomore similar markets first.
02:33:21.653 There will be more risk going into...
02:33:23.493 You need product market fit,which I am aligned.
02:33:25.613 You go to-- Like, we also are goingto similar markets,
02:33:28.173 which are easy acceptance.
02:33:29.573 And then try to go in territory--I respect all territories.
02:33:32.973 So, I mean, let's say US,these are all tough markets.
02:33:35.453 It's easy to go and break there.
02:33:37.053 So, I would like to go small there,do little trials, fail, and then take on.
02:33:42.693 Yeah. So, they are, as I said,going to SAARC countries,
02:33:45.213 going to, you know,Russia, Eastern Europe,
02:33:49.333 which are all, you know, great marketsfor you to do your trials and all.
02:33:53.173 And then also tweak.
02:33:55.013 We should start, like, a hub.
02:33:58.493 Like, start a placewhere we fund young entrepreneurs
02:34:01.613 to build some of the stuff we spoke about.
02:34:04.173 100%
02:34:06.653 Right? Like, get some land,give them the resources.
02:34:11.573 You guys all have the know-how.
02:34:14.893 Like, start one place where people can--
02:34:17.533 Like, an incubator of sorts,with real estate.
02:34:20.533 And it's easier to do. On...
02:34:24.533 And it could be anything.
02:34:26.093 You know, you can--
02:34:27.573 If somebody comes up with an ideawith a diaper,
02:34:31.093 which will have some connectivity,
02:34:33.053 which tells that it is wet or notor whatever.
02:34:36.533 Same tech you could be using,let's say, in the ring.
02:34:39.093 I just found out a techwhere my daughter--
02:34:43.133 My wife wanted to monitormy daughter about fever.
02:34:46.453 And you can't measureevery time for a kid.
02:34:48.173 So, there was a socks she could wearwhen she was six months or a year.
02:34:52.413 It could track the sleep,the temperature and everything. So...
02:34:57.653 These are micro-niche markets,but yeah, innovations are there.
02:35:00.613 What's the deal with these ringsthat you are wearing?
02:35:02.973 Why are they growing so much?Why is everybody buying them?
02:35:05.893 So, I think market movesin different form factors.
02:35:12.493 And market need newness.
02:35:16.933 This form factor, like watches,are maybe mass-adoption phase,
02:35:20.813 whatever phase you want to call.
02:35:23.693 Rings are a new category, early adopters.
02:35:27.533 And people are gettingmore health conscious, also.
02:35:30.973 So, they are pairing itwith their watches, by the way.
02:35:34.013 They are not a replacement for a watch.
02:35:35.733 Is that an opportunity,health-related consumer electronics?
02:35:40.253 You guys seeing any trends there?
02:35:41.893 So, I wear a WHOOP on my feet.
02:35:46.373 So, what I have realised,I am into, I mean...
02:35:50.573 I am little bit into this space,so I understand it.
02:35:53.773 So, consumer is saying it's good to have.
02:35:57.373 Meaning, I want a fitness device,but I will not track fitness.
02:36:00.813 I mean, you would see a guywearing a WHOOP-- I was talking--
02:36:04.133 and eating a McDonald's burgerand a cola and a 100 kilos.
02:36:09.693 So, it's just visual cues to tell people
02:36:13.093 that I belong to this universewhere I know.
02:36:16.493 I want to know what I am,but they are not cautious.
02:36:19.573 I think they are little bit aware of it,but not that--
02:36:23.733 India is a market, internationally, yes.
02:36:25.533 People are more and more health conscious.
02:36:28.613 Preventive healthcare is...
02:36:30.213 -You know that patch which measures---CGM.
02:36:33.493 -Insulin spikes.-Yeah.
02:36:35.453 I have always been thinkingthat at some point
02:36:37.733 an Apple Watch can start doing that.
02:36:39.253 Do you think that's an opportunity,if your watch has a CGM monitor in it?
02:36:43.613 So, if you look at use cases,so I think these devices--
02:36:47.653 Okay, diabetic is a very big used case,this problem.
02:36:52.653 And this doesn't work, by the way.Nobody uses it.
02:36:55.933 For us, we have used for wellness,but diabetic patient also doesn't use it.
02:36:59.613 It is 5,000 bucks, it's too expensive.
02:37:01.333 And nobody wants to break it every time.
02:37:04.253 So, we feel wearable gonna diverttowards health side,
02:37:06.733 like we were talking about.
02:37:08.093 Health is a segment.
02:37:09.533 Thirty-five plus,you start getting those problems.
02:37:11.773 Apple is 100% working on it.
02:37:14.053 But Apple will only come when it becomesreally solid, mainstream, proven,
02:37:20.333 because it's health.
02:37:21.733 Is there no opportunity unique to India?
02:37:24.133 What do we want in healththat other people don't want?
02:37:26.853 No, I think, no.
02:37:28.253 This is a good spaceif somebody is working on it.
02:37:30.973 Honestly,I would like to invest in a space
02:37:32.573 where people are working on CGM.
02:37:34.253 So, Apple is working.
02:37:35.453 Samsung has a huge R&D centrein Bangalore,
02:37:37.773 where they are working onblood pressure and CGM on device,
02:37:43.093 where it's non-invasive.
02:37:44.493 So, I think in two-three years timewe will see it there.
02:37:47.973 I believe in health.Health has PMF in consumer electronics.
02:37:52.093 And another field that has PMFis children's education.
02:37:56.253 Parents are always willing to investin the future of their kids.
02:38:00.653 What would that look like?
02:38:02.373 We have a common friendwho is building this company
02:38:04.813 called SuperLearn, where--
02:38:10.373 He is trying to build a tabletwhich costs $150,
02:38:15.893 where you can't, like,really browse the net
02:38:18.933 and go to YouTube and Netflix,
02:38:21.773 but replace your school bagwith that device.
02:38:24.213 You mean learning like that? Do you thinksomething like that could work?
02:38:26.733 That could work.
02:38:27.813 It could also be, like,some form of smartwatch for kids,
02:38:31.333 for learning, maybe with an AI companion.
02:38:33.653 It could also just be a teddy bear.
02:38:35.853 That's there, no? The toy is there.
02:38:37.853 Miko-- Miko is doing good.
02:38:40.893 I just know that it's a spacewhere people want to spend money
02:38:44.613 and are not price sensitive.
02:38:46.733 So, you-- Wherever you are spending,
02:38:48.813 you will spend for your parents,you will spend for your kids.
02:38:50.813 And your health.
02:38:52.773 And health.
02:38:53.973 What do you guys think of Elon Muskin Neuralink?
02:38:56.173 I like the thesis.
02:38:57.813 It's trying to make the communicationmore efficient.
02:39:02.773 Efficiency is always beneficialto humanity.
02:39:06.813 But maybe there are other waysto get to higher efficiency.
02:39:09.293 I don't know how long it will takefor that to really work for mass market.
02:39:14.573 Do you think people will be willingto do that?
02:39:16.853 Like, put something in your body,not on your body?
02:39:20.773 If the benefits are there, I think so.
02:39:22.693 But currently...I don't think the benefits are there.
02:39:26.653 Just dovetailing into his question.
02:39:29.133 Wherein, these days,people are talking more about organic.
02:39:32.293 They don't want to takeunnecessary medicines and...
02:39:37.333 I mean, for somebody who is disabled,
02:39:39.973 then they get a lot of benefitfrom using that product today.
02:39:43.373 But at what pointdoes it become beneficial
02:39:45.493 for a normal person to use that? And why?
02:39:48.413 I think there is still some time to go.
02:39:51.893 Wouldn't you suddenly becomeso much smarter
02:39:53.853 if you have something in your headwhich is telling you everything?
02:39:57.973 You can almost have that already nowif you have earbuds with ChatGPT.
02:40:02.013 You can speak to ChatGPT voice.
02:40:03.773 -With the AI glass also coming.-[Carl] Yeah.
02:40:05.573 You are sitting in front of this.This is the setup. This is happening--
02:40:07.973 That's way easier to adoptthan operating something into your body.
02:40:12.533 What happens to the world? Like...
02:40:14.573 If intelligence is on call,
02:40:17.213 traditional intelligence is on callor information is on call,
02:40:22.293 we still have to differentiate.
02:40:24.293 How do we do that?
02:40:26.093 I think most people are going to...
02:40:28.453 I think 80% of the populationwill just chill
02:40:30.813 and receive income from the government.
02:40:33.293 And a small group of peoplewill leverage the new technologies
02:40:36.093 to push society and humanity forward.
02:40:38.733 Like universal basic income.
02:40:40.293 Yeah. I think that will happen for sure.
02:40:42.493 Yeah?
02:40:43.813 I think you can't replace, you know,emotional quotient out of that.
02:40:47.253 You know, that's what makesall of us unique.
02:40:50.493 All of us--
02:40:51.573 You give us the same piece of informationto all four of us,
02:40:54.333 all four of us will behave differently
02:40:56.773 and will have different actions.
02:40:58.693 I think that is something which...
02:41:02.813 you can't take away.
02:41:06.453 Do you think?
02:41:08.213 A little bit agree on this.
02:41:10.973 Basic, I think 80% of the jobswill be done,
02:41:13.413 for 20% you would still need human...
02:41:17.093 The productivity will increase so much.
02:41:19.373 But I think he is also rightthat we all will become more lazy.
02:41:22.173 Like, kids todaydon't need to use their brain.
02:41:24.133 They will be doing everything on...
02:41:26.853 You need to be very self-motivated,
02:41:28.653 but those peoplecan really leverage the technology
02:41:30.773 to create so much more productivity.
02:41:33.093 I wonder if a kid will think tomorrow
02:41:34.933 if I can just regurgitate a bookfrom my device at any point,
02:41:38.613 then why read the book?
02:41:40.373 That's how I was thinkingwhen I was in school.
02:41:42.373 -Like, I can just Google the information.-[Amit] Yeah.
02:41:44.213 Why should I memorise this?
02:41:45.653 Okay. Last part.
02:41:48.293 I want each of you guys to give one advice
02:41:51.653 to me, the 25-year-old,having watched this today.
02:41:56.973 Tomorrow morning I want to wake upand figure out what to build.
02:41:59.493 One piece of advice.
02:42:01.653 Would you like to go first?
02:42:06.213 I think if somebody needs toplan something in this space
02:42:11.933 or whatever space, I think,
02:42:14.573 definitely a thorough research is needed.
02:42:17.533 I mean, why you're going in, and--
02:42:19.933 I think you need to have that fuelor patience also to build it.
02:42:22.533 That passion we are talking about
02:42:25.333 and do pick up a narrow nicheinstead of going too broad.
02:42:30.413 I mean, pick up a smaller subsetof whatever problem you want to solve.
02:42:34.773 Go double down and then move on.
02:42:37.373 Definitely there are going to befailures, learnings--
02:42:39.653 But I would term them as learningsand you keep pivoting with that.
02:42:43.693 So that would be one thing.
02:42:45.853 I would say be really surethat you want to do something.
02:42:50.133 It's not always fun.
02:42:52.893 I think most peopleshould not be entrepreneurs.
02:42:55.253 Most people have a much higherquality of life doing other things,
02:42:59.413 specialising in a tech fieldor working for somebody else.
02:43:04.693 Very inspiring advice
02:43:06.693 to wannabe entrepreneurs, Carl,I must say.
02:43:10.453 It's better to say it now, right,rather than finding out down the line?
02:43:14.453 [Rahul] He is scaring us.
02:43:15.893 Just be really sure.
02:43:16.973 I think, like, it needs to come froma deep passion around something
02:43:21.973 because it's going to be hard.
02:43:23.453 There will be euphoric days,but there will also be terrible days.
02:43:27.733 Like, lack of sleep for weeks. Like--
02:43:30.693 I mean, we've allbeen through that probably.
02:43:33.973 Why are you going to keep pushing forwardwhen you face those difficulties?
02:43:37.453 I think you've got to be surethat this is what you really want to do,
02:43:41.333 that you're passionate about it.
02:43:43.773 I believe in the potentialof every individual person.
02:43:46.253 Like, if you really want toaccomplish something, you can.
02:43:49.453 But there's a cost associated with it.
02:43:53.253 And I think for most people,the cost is not worth it.
02:43:58.133 Rahul?
02:44:00.173 My only advice will beshow me your five friends.
02:44:06.213 Because...
02:44:10.493 if you have to build a successful company,then you have to keep a good company.
02:44:15.773 So, if you have--And you will become like that.
02:44:19.853 So, if you have a good companyof people, who are like-minded,
02:44:27.133 then even if you have, you know,there's certain qualities
02:44:31.013 and things which you don't possess,you can, you know...
02:44:35.213 A, rely, learn, and do,
02:44:39.133 and, you know, come up with...
02:44:42.533 come out of various difficulties.
02:44:44.133 So, basically you will become, like,whatever your company is.
02:44:49.733 So, if your company is, like,
02:44:51.773 there are guys who are doing other things,
02:44:56.093 you will eventually, you will go that way.
02:45:00.173 But if you havefive people reading biology,
02:45:06.813 you will certainly go down that path.
02:45:08.493 Even if you are not--You don't want to learn,
02:45:11.173 you say, "No, I am not a bio person,I am a physics person."
02:45:14.213 But, at least, you are doing physics.
02:45:17.173 You are not just doing anything else.
02:45:20.373 So, just keep a cohort of those people...
02:45:26.853 and I think you will--
02:45:29.093 A lot of things will get resolved.
02:45:30.733 Fair.
02:45:32.213 My fleeting thought,
02:45:34.333 I am quite excitedabout this component incubator.
02:45:38.213 I would say let's each of usput in a little bit of money,
02:45:42.253 not care too much about the upside,
02:45:45.013 and try and get not too many.
02:45:47.093 I think we should find four kids,
02:45:49.053 support them in buildinga component company
02:45:51.693 with time, money and all of that.
02:45:54.373 And maybe other people can learnfrom what we have done and replicate.
02:45:58.413 And I hope we are successful.
02:46:00.533 But, thank you to each one of you
02:46:02.853 for flying into my home and doing this.
02:46:06.693 Very kind and I will reach out to you
02:46:09.533 for different kinds of adviceat different points of time,
02:46:13.893 and also to help all the youngwannabe entrepreneurs in India.
02:46:16.933 But, thank you.
