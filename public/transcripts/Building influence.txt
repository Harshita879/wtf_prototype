00:01:57.560 fun should we start with the project oh
00:02:02.000 okay yeah hi do I say it to everybody
00:02:05.640 yeah yeah oh then it's
00:02:07.959 awkward but uh I'm praa I'm a content
00:02:11.360 creator actor now from Mumbai India and
00:02:15.440 I started creating content uh in
00:02:17.760 2015 and I've been doing it for close to
00:02:19.959 9 years now and um I kind of also
00:02:23.239 branched out into acting a little bit in
00:02:24.920 2019 why did you first begin creating
00:02:27.400 content um because I fa fa at the one
00:02:30.440 dream that I had I wanted to be a radio
00:02:32.040 jockey ever since I was 11 failed
00:02:34.239 meaning I I became a radio jockey and
00:02:35.879 the show didn't work and I got fired and
00:02:38.120 I also heard myself so I get it so when
00:02:39.879 I started doing radio it was fun for the
00:02:41.879 first I think couple of months and then
00:02:43.319 later it just got like it was nothing
00:02:45.040 like I'd imagined it would be so it's
00:02:46.720 quite disappointing and uh that's when I
00:02:48.959 met sudp from one digital and he was
00:02:51.239 like you should have a YouTube channel
00:02:54.159 it should create content and I didn't
00:02:55.480 know what that meant so and I was very
00:02:57.640 unhappy as a radio intern so I was like
00:02:59.879 what I'm just going to try content and
00:03:01.400 in mumbay 10 years ago in Mumbai yeah
00:03:03.959 and uh it just started like that I had
00:03:06.480 absolutely no dreams or no uh kind of
00:03:09.239 way forward or any idea about what I was
00:03:11.120 doing all of you guys who have done
00:03:13.159 influencing for so long you know what is
00:03:15.799 one thing which is so stuck like the way
00:03:18.680 your voice has infl sorry one second I
00:03:20.319 have to stop you there's no such thing
00:03:21.319 as
00:03:22.040 influencing no one here has done any
00:03:23.879 influence influencers are the fathers
00:03:26.200 the doctors the mothers the teachers
00:03:27.920 they influence children we've done done
00:03:30.200 creating of content we created content
00:03:33.720 and it has impacted people but
00:03:35.599 influencer is a term is like M by Bombay
00:03:38.439 influencer as a term is like
00:03:41.080 slightly self-obsessed no what do you
00:03:43.680 guys think good I never related to that
00:03:46.319 term honestly project actually I I want
00:03:48.519 to add uh Pro was one of the earlier
00:03:51.239 Generations on on YouTube uh then she
00:03:54.280 did a short film called kipa in case you
00:03:56.200 haven't seen that was the first time I
00:03:57.640 saw proa act good yeah really good um
00:04:00.799 and I messaged her also after that
00:04:02.280 saying I didn't know you could act
00:04:04.079 that's crazy and now that you mentioned
00:04:05.840 theater and then um um yeah I've known
00:04:08.519 pra for a while she's extremely
00:04:10.280 hardworking you're marati I am yes my
00:04:12.640 mama's from Delhi Baba's from what do
00:04:15.079 your parents
00:04:16.040 do Baba used to work uh he was in
00:04:19.880 Cadbury before and then later he was
00:04:22.079 working in real estate and uh mama was a
00:04:24.400 phonetics teacher she used to teach
00:04:25.759 languages phonetics teacher yeah wow
00:04:28.800 what is what is that
00:04:30.400 so um I mean she used to have a bunch of
00:04:32.320 kids because apparently they are not
00:04:33.520 taught ABCD anymore it's a b c du so
00:04:37.240 it's the phonetics that and she used to
00:04:39.039 teach that I'll tell you more about her
00:04:41.120 yeah oh wow is this ining each other can
00:04:44.360 we can we do this can the three of you
00:04:46.440 say what does praa appear to the outside
00:04:49.680 world in your lens yeah uh so I'd had
00:04:52.120 Priyanka Chopra on the podcast once and
00:04:54.240 she gave this example of a swan that
00:04:56.280 looks like it's very peaceful on the
00:04:58.440 surface but on the inside the feet are
00:05:00.600 paddling uh I don't think I've come
00:05:03.400 across a more hardworking and
00:05:05.400 disciplined professional than this
00:05:06.720 person seconded she's very hard working
00:05:08.800 like she's probably the most disciplined
00:05:11.440 content creator that I've known
00:05:13.600 throughout my career and she is uh Bill
00:05:16.280 Gates's favorite Creator every time I
00:05:18.840 see her it's either at at Bill Gates
00:05:21.120 conference or at Davos conference so
00:05:23.400 she's like represents India in the major
00:05:26.759 conferences I'll tell you what they're
00:05:27.840 not going to invite tan for this one
00:05:30.840 too risky D not anymore brother notore
00:05:34.520 how is that how how do you get yourself
00:05:36.800 in these
00:05:38.319 places I think YouTube had a huge role
00:05:41.720 to play in that um I
00:05:44.560 2019 is when um YouTube kind of reached
00:05:48.319 out to me for this program called
00:05:49.600 creators for change
00:05:51.479 2018 and uh they were like do you want
00:05:53.680 to so they pick a few creators from
00:05:55.600 across the world and they put like a
00:05:56.800 band of us together and they like make
00:05:58.919 videos for for this program called
00:06:00.520 creators for Change and every year they
00:06:02.199 have different um themes in 2019 in 2018
00:06:06.520 is when they reached out for the first
00:06:07.520 time and then 2019 was the second year
00:06:10.360 and that's when um there was this
00:06:12.560 documentary that they were making with u
00:06:14.800 Michelle Obama for girls education and
00:06:17.319 they reached out to me for that and I
00:06:18.560 think that was my first kind of Step Up
00:06:21.880 From what I was doing back home and that
00:06:24.520 kind of opened a lot of doors for me uh
00:06:26.840 so YouTube has been a huge cheerleader
00:06:28.919 in my journey
00:06:30.000 Beyond just doing the content that I was
00:06:32.120 natively doing on my channel just
00:06:34.000 putting me out there giving me a
00:06:35.080 platform to speak about things and um
00:06:37.800 then I happened to meet nikil Tanja who
00:06:40.280 kind of put me in touch with
00:06:42.400 goalkeepers uh so that's how that
00:06:44.319 started the UN DP kind of came in
00:06:46.400 through both these channels so it it
00:06:49.080 kind of went into a whole domino effect
00:06:51.120 once the first creators for change video
00:06:53.319 went out and um yeah so that's how
00:06:56.720 that's how it began and when did you
00:06:58.599 blow up and all of that 2018
00:07:00.800 2017 my first video actually went viral
00:07:04.360 so I started in 20 Feb of 2015 and the
00:07:06.560 first video that really really blew up
00:07:08.919 was in the July of that year what was it
00:07:11.479 about it was a video called uh words
00:07:14.199 Deli Hees use i h a lot of Deli ego in
00:07:17.479 that video uh but it kind of like blew
00:07:20.080 up and uh then it's just been like a
00:07:23.479 roller coaster like it was not one week
00:07:25.680 was like another for a very very long
00:07:28.160 time right cool and now what are you
00:07:31.120 looking forward to um I'm looking
00:07:34.120 forward to more acting M I'm looking I'm
00:07:36.680 writing is that a natural transition
00:07:39.759 Creator distribution acting it wasn't
00:07:43.319 planned I was very surprised when it
00:07:45.360 started coming my way because I didn't
00:07:47.039 when I started making content I didn't I
00:07:49.080 I don't think any of us thought that
00:07:50.199 these Avenues were actually even
00:07:51.800 possible um for us so I was very
00:07:54.479 surprised with it I've always loved
00:07:56.199 acting uh and I missed it after I quit
00:07:58.560 theater M um so when it came I was like
00:08:01.080 okay I'm going to give it a try but it
00:08:02.560 wasn't conscious no it just kind of
00:08:04.720 happened is there a hierarchy in that
00:08:06.720 world like I know there is a hierarchy
00:08:09.360 between TV actors and large screen
00:08:12.520 actors uh when a influencer comes into
00:08:16.280 that world uh is it tougher like are you
00:08:19.560 treated the same as an actor actor um I
00:08:23.280 feel like I also happen to be very
00:08:25.759 fortunate to become an actor at a time
00:08:28.319 when it's
00:08:30.039 when the lines are slightly blurrier
00:08:31.919 than they were before I feel like OT
00:08:33.958 really opened it up for actors where now
00:08:36.080 if you see like for example seeing what
00:08:38.519 a Karishma Tana is doing or what a har
00:08:40.320 bja is doing like it was it's just crazy
00:08:42.919 seeing them uh because now suddenly I
00:08:45.240 don't think that I don't think that
00:08:47.080 hierarchy is there where you know if
00:08:48.399 you're a TV actor you won't get cast
00:08:50.040 because TV film theater everybody's
00:08:52.680 doing OT I don't mean from a casting
00:08:54.399 lens but from a societal hierarchy
00:08:58.279 perception lens
00:08:59.800 I think there is unfortunately there is
00:09:02.480 there's even there's even classism
00:09:04.640 between platforms if you're a Tik tocker
00:09:07.200 a facebooker a YouTuber or an
00:09:08.480 instagrammer it's like YouTuber is like
00:09:11.399 class one citizen then instagrammer then
00:09:14.000 then Tik tocker then Facebook is that
00:09:16.320 true yeah that I agree do you agree with
00:09:19.160 the classing what did you say again the
00:09:21.320 order I think YouTube Instagram Facebook
00:09:24.200 uh Tik Tok Facebook I think um see the
00:09:27.600 people who there's a line that I think
00:09:30.519 Kunal sha had once said which
00:09:32.519 is uh screen profile right like um the
00:09:39.000 bigger the the bigger the screen uh the
00:09:41.040 higher the status totally right so movie
00:09:43.920 you perceive perception is very high
00:09:45.760 status and then for a long time it was
00:09:47.839 like television came before digital and
00:09:49.880 I think now digital is kind of
00:09:51.800 penetrating a lot of it mostly my thesis
00:09:54.040 is that hey if if you own distribution
00:09:56.200 you own eyeballs no matter what where
00:09:58.160 you move to the eyeball balls will
00:09:59.480 travel there and it's playing out in the
00:10:00.760 OT world like ban has his own show pra
00:10:02.959 has her own show um but I think like
00:10:06.839 it's still plays out in ways like like
00:10:09.200 if a if a you know an Instagram Creator
00:10:13.320 gets a holding right they're on a hoing
00:10:16.079 it's still a huge moment it becomes the
00:10:17.600 real saying oh look I'm on a hoing even
00:10:20.600 though every story gets way more
00:10:22.800 eyeballs than a holding aing a hoing
00:10:25.959 like a billboard oh you were in a
00:10:27.480 billboard recently I was yeah a candy
00:10:29.760 thing yeah with candy and yeah so when I
00:10:32.440 was in a billboard it's like the
00:10:33.240 billboard gets Fu 10 views 20 views
00:10:35.560 exactly but the picture of the billboard
00:10:37.560 on
00:10:38.399 Instagram so many likes I have something
00:10:40.880 to say about kuna thing the screen uh
00:10:44.360 what what what did you say that the
00:10:45.440 bigger the screen is the bigger the
00:10:46.839 screen higher the
00:10:48.079 status and then combining it with this
00:10:50.320 whole us getting older and times
00:10:52.639 changing I'd be way more excited to meet
00:10:54.880 Joe Rogan than Tom Cruz because Joe
00:10:56.920 Rogan's affected my life so much in the
00:10:58.399 last 10 years yeah and I'm not at allzy
00:11:01.200 I'm like a core Millennial but I can see
00:11:03.720 how my thought process is becoming Morey
00:11:05.880 just because of the times and I'm sure
00:11:07.639 that a lot of genzies would say that
00:11:09.320 about the digital stars who have
00:11:11.480 survived in the long term like I I don't
00:11:14.040 care about meeting Hollywood actors I
00:11:15.399 would care a lot about meeting naal
00:11:16.680 ravikant and Joe Rogan and Tim you think
00:11:18.760 that would be true for you uh it it was
00:11:21.720 true even in the previous generation let
00:11:23.600 me explain
00:11:24.959 how like in our time it would be
00:11:28.320 insanely to hang out with an MTV VJ it
00:11:31.360 would be very cool right cuz they were
00:11:33.720 not movie stars but they were the other
00:11:36.399 cat R right like I'd give leg to hang
00:11:39.200 out with r so it was the other category
00:11:42.000 of someone that you saw regularly you
00:11:44.399 know you'd see a movie star twice a year
00:11:46.320 but here were VJs Who You'd see every
00:11:47.959 day and similarly now for people that'd
00:11:49.800 be watching n every day so that feeling
00:11:52.320 of oh my God I can't believe this moment
00:11:54.040 is real uh happens more when you see
00:11:56.839 someone regularly so I think digital
00:11:59.360 folks have occupied that um so it's it's
00:12:01.959 been true for multiple Generations I
00:12:03.519 think it's not just now actually very
00:12:05.800 interesting and the kids of today the
00:12:07.480 amount of time they spend on devices not
00:12:10.200 watching movies the number one
00:12:11.959 occupation for that people why for today
00:12:15.320 especially kids is influencer yeah you
00:12:17.880 know that's the reason why we were doing
00:12:19.560 this uh so this show is typically around
00:12:23.000 people who want to be an entrepreneur
00:12:25.120 yeah so whatever a 20-year-old boy or
00:12:28.519 girl needs to know about entering a
00:12:31.360 certain industry we try and hit that and
00:12:34.199 give them all the info that is required
00:12:36.040 like we did one around starting a
00:12:37.839 restaurant recently we did something
00:12:39.760 else before that uh it has become so
00:12:43.800 important even for people like me uh an
00:12:46.399 entrepreneur to build distribution cuz
00:12:50.040 paying for distribution takes away so
00:12:52.160 much of the Delta you might have uh that
00:12:55.040 a distri that a person with distribution
00:12:56.959 brings organically yeah uh I think we
00:12:59.480 left off at they said what they think
00:13:01.920 about proa you did not they said
00:13:03.680 hardworking hard workking no I I said I
00:13:05.440 said that she's representing India to
00:13:07.560 the world but if we're speaking of
00:13:09.480 hardworking I want to mention something
00:13:10.560 about N I don't know anyone who works as
00:13:13.600 much you just said that about her no I
00:13:15.440 didn't say that about her I
00:13:17.279 didn't Jud hard who works harder noero
00:13:21.680 him him him for
00:13:23.199 sure Works incredibly hard and I think I
00:13:26.560 once asked I won't mention what he said
00:13:28.120 but I once asked saying what drives him
00:13:30.560 and he's got like an ambition and a
00:13:32.680 purpose that is intensely strong you
00:13:36.360 know um that I think is like I I I don't
00:13:39.519 feel that what what feels I also feel
00:13:43.199 like with him he's always so aware and
00:13:46.360 so on like I'll at least at least 20
00:13:49.839 times a day I'll have moments where I'll
00:13:51.600 just zone out and I'll not kind of keep
00:13:54.040 up with but anytime you meet him and i'
00:13:56.120 I've seen him at 5:00 in the morning at
00:13:57.920 a breakfast buffet I've seen him at 2:00
00:14:00.480 in the morning at a party with a drink
00:14:02.000 and I just feel like I mean I I had the
00:14:07.120 drink me I had a
00:14:09.519 Dr but um every time I've had a
00:14:12.480 conversation with him it's never been
00:14:15.560 dull or it's never been kind of like you
00:14:18.040 know it's not it's not small talk which
00:14:19.839 I appreciate each of you have a
00:14:21.639 different Journey from whatever
00:14:23.680 profession to content creator yeah to
00:14:27.240 another profession actor
00:14:29.399 uh
00:14:30.639 businessman uh social change maker no no
00:14:35.279 no entrepreneur
00:14:36.880 entrepreneur I'm not a social change
00:14:38.759 maker entrepreneur sounds cooler than
00:14:41.160 businessman businessman sounds like I'm
00:14:43.560 sing hustler hustler yeah what am I you
00:14:47.240 are you are King n right you are poster
00:14:50.560 boy Bangalore poster boy and ran I think
00:14:55.440 I did a little bit of Entrepreneurship
00:14:56.959 but I'm back to being a content creator
00:14:58.320 and I want to stay here I I'm really
00:14:59.839 enjoying this wow bro get out please get
00:15:04.199 out it's mentally hard it's it's it's
00:15:08.120 horrible in some ways uh but it's also
00:15:10.360 beautiful in some ways because I think
00:15:12.360 over the course of my 20s my priorities
00:15:14.160 have changed a lot and I'm really
00:15:16.839 enjoying the work I do because it's
00:15:19.320 truly not feeling like work it does feel
00:15:21.600 like spending a lot of hours creating
00:15:23.320 that many podcasts and that much content
00:15:25.880 but uh I think I've started craving
00:15:29.759 heartfelt messages and and impact in
00:15:32.360 people's lives much more than I craved
00:15:34.800 money and numbers and growth in my 20s
00:15:37.800 but I get to say that preneurship is not
00:15:39.880 money and that's the biggest surprise I
00:15:42.639 I also have the luxury of having really
00:15:44.240 active co-founders who are growing the
00:15:46.319 businesses and allowing me to just chase
00:15:48.639 the content creation game because of the
00:15:50.279 distribution thing you said earlier
00:15:52.720 which is sorry yeah sorry uh B the
00:15:56.000 easier way of saying that is if you're
00:15:57.680 more famous you reach out to more people
00:15:59.319 you can sell your product to more people
00:16:00.720 eventually which we're seeing with all
00:16:02.600 the businesses that are being built out
00:16:04.199 any but I'm going to say something
00:16:05.240 controversial sure at some point you
00:16:07.160 will not get more famous at some point
00:16:08.720 you will saturate every single person in
00:16:10.639 India that could potentially like you
00:16:12.639 then you'll have this amazing and sad
00:16:15.160 Decline and then the platforms want to
00:16:17.279 show a different face a different
00:16:18.920 podcast a different name and then ah
00:16:20.880 what do you do then so I mean I try I
00:16:25.560 are you fun at
00:16:27.079 parties see that is I had a drink when I
00:16:29.759 saw
00:16:31.279 it I'm just saying there's a shelf life
00:16:33.720 to Creator life I I think so interesting
00:16:37.519 I think so and I intend on exiting
00:16:39.120 Creator life at some point but also
00:16:42.199 cumulatively I have like a bunch of
00:16:44.120 channels we have a lot I'm not like
00:16:47.560 number dropping you but like we have
00:16:49.040 like 20 to 25 million across those
00:16:51.639 channels I'm I have a huge amount of
00:16:54.319 distribution yeah and the thing is we in
00:16:56.600 a country of 1.5 billion people people
00:16:58.639 1.6 I don't know what's the number what
00:17:00.399 1.6 billion people
00:17:02.040 1.3 but we added 300 million now in the
00:17:04.599 last 10 seconds so never really know you
00:17:07.439 never have an exact you're rounding
00:17:09.160 error the whole pop 1.5 for the sake of
00:17:12.359 conversation what is 25 million people
00:17:15.679 in front of 1.5 billion people to
00:17:17.839 capture and i' I've I've got these 25
00:17:20.119 million people over the last 8 years so
00:17:22.559 even if I continue for another 20 years
00:17:24.520 I think I'll reach a really large number
00:17:27.480 but also I have an English Channel and a
00:17:29.039 Hindi Channel and my intentions with
00:17:30.320 English are very International my
00:17:31.600 intentions with Hindi are very National
00:17:33.160 but your problem is not the population
00:17:35.120 of India it's the social media algorithm
00:17:37.559 eventually they will say I don't want to
00:17:39.799 give this guy too much distribution
00:17:41.559 because the best interest of YouTube is
00:17:43.919 to have a new Mr Beast every 5 years
00:17:46.240 which is why I'll also be aggressive on
00:17:48.840 my Instagram can you tell me can you
00:17:51.039 tell me why why that is why will YouTube
00:17:53.480 benefit from creating a new Mr Beast
00:17:55.440 when there is one already because
00:17:57.080 imagine a world in which on YouTube we
00:17:59.360 only watch Mr Beast as the number one
00:18:01.240 creator for the next 30 Years that is
00:18:03.600 not actually in YouTube's best interest
00:18:05.640 you want new faces I mean just like
00:18:07.600 Hollywood you want why can't there be Mr
00:18:09.720 Beast plus plus because in the content
00:18:11.799 World there is the power law in which
00:18:14.360 20% of the creators get 80% of the
00:18:16.559 attention the power law is massive here
00:18:19.400 so it's not like everybody gets one
00:18:20.880 million views Are You Hell happy no it's
00:18:22.520 like if one person is slightly more
00:18:24.159 engaging they'll get 10 times more than
00:18:27.200 the the the one next to them except I
00:18:29.200 think like it's not as Sinister as if if
00:18:32.159 you just take this clip out of context
00:18:33.840 it's like Susan vki is sitting down is
00:18:35.960 like enough of Mr Beast now Neil Neil
00:18:38.960 moan Neil Neil yeah uh love you Neil
00:18:43.880 um it's not as Sinister as that sound
00:18:46.440 it's just what happens is that look all
00:18:48.080 platforms at the end of the day digital
00:18:49.600 platforms are trying to grab eyeballs
00:18:51.559 from other platforms so they all
00:18:54.039 eventually tweak their algorithm just a
00:18:55.880 little bit and it sometimes it can take
00:18:58.960 creators by surprise that oh X thing was
00:19:02.320 working for so long and now it's no
00:19:04.640 longer working some of this is a
00:19:05.880 byproduct of just general audience
00:19:07.400 fatigue which is if I if like I know I'm
00:19:09.840 the type of Creator who am a binge watch
00:19:11.559 type of Creator which is people come
00:19:12.640 into my they're going to watch me
00:19:14.320 for three months and they're like I get
00:19:15.840 I get this thing now but I'm over it I'm
00:19:17.280 going to move on so my attrition rate on
00:19:19.440 my viewers I look at it as okay this is
00:19:21.000 a three to four month game and that can
00:19:23.159 take creators by surprise and in the 10
00:19:25.679 years that I've you know 10 12 years
00:19:27.440 that I've been around and there there
00:19:28.840 have been we call them batches of
00:19:30.159 creators like there are creators who
00:19:31.440 come in batches and then you know four
00:19:33.320 years later you got to reinvent yourself
00:19:35.240 or else the next batch will take over so
00:19:37.600 on and so forth but so let me be the bad
00:19:39.360 guy and sound the alarm to everybody
00:19:41.480 listening and watching this podcast
00:19:43.360 which is guys you must plan and engineer
00:19:47.320 your exit plan when you make it big as a
00:19:49.480 content creator because no one sees the
00:19:52.360 decline because you're not getting the
00:19:53.679 views the decline is often times very
00:19:55.240 lonely no one has seen the decline of
00:19:57.080 like the Hollywood celebrity but you
00:19:58.720 just haven't seen them in movies but you
00:20:00.440 totally forgot about them so you must
00:20:02.760 always get an exit plan which I believe
00:20:04.760 should be other entrepreneurship or
00:20:06.760 acting or books or whatever and how long
00:20:10.039 do you think this journey typically is
00:20:11.960 if you make it as a Creator so I I would
00:20:15.679 love to hear what you guys think I think
00:20:17.039 life is goes in seven-year chunks sevene
00:20:20.320 how did you come to this number that's
00:20:21.640 interesting uh so there's a we're just
00:20:23.400 talking about it the seven-year itch we
00:20:25.880 have something in Hindu culture as well
00:20:28.320 years of good luck bad
00:20:29.880 luck interesting what is the average
00:20:32.360 marriage in India in in the US and the
00:20:34.919 average marriage in China it's 6.6 years
00:20:37.720 oh really why is that is that all well
00:20:41.240 in India is probably 70 years
00:20:44.880 average why why are people still getting
00:20:47.039 married then n we not going to discuss
00:20:50.200 personal problems
00:20:51.840 now iing saying your taste buds even
00:20:54.039 change your Sills and your body change
00:20:55.400 every seven years what kind of taste
00:20:56.880 buds every somebody told me this don't
00:20:59.039 quote me in this but every cell in your
00:21:00.559 body changes every seven years ah how
00:21:03.360 long did you and alen date seven
00:21:07.280 years no wonder you're so confident with
00:21:10.000 the numbers who whose tast but
00:21:12.919 changed yeah interesting I I yeah that
00:21:16.760 seems fair how long have you been a
00:21:18.600 content creator since 200 so I began by
00:21:22.200 doing standup which is technically
00:21:23.679 content creation that was 2009 is when I
00:21:25.919 started doing stand-up so you've done 14
00:21:27.720 years wow 14 14 years and before
00:21:31.600 itations different formats different
00:21:33.200 formats actually before that I was
00:21:35.080 writing for television so I started by
00:21:37.640 writing comedy first then I started
00:21:39.000 performing comedy then I did YouTube and
00:21:42.200 then I started doing I've started doing
00:21:45.240 everything else I was one of the first
00:21:47.159 20,000 people who followed aiv on
00:21:49.480 Facebook oh really for the aiv podcast
00:21:52.440 hey but you guys should now introduce
00:21:53.919 yourself cuz I know you guys but people
00:21:57.159 will want to know uh um I introduced
00:22:00.080 myself on this podcast like four
00:22:02.360 times T is like the OG he's like
00:22:05.720 co-founder of this podcast coer for 20
00:22:08.159 companies too everyone I meet in
00:22:10.600 Bangalore now is like T is my co-founder
00:22:13.360 he's taking over Bangalore are you
00:22:15.760 franchising the founder yeah either
00:22:18.440 co-founder or he's written the ads or
00:22:20.559 he's doing some marketing work with them
00:22:22.720 like I'm not kidding I'm working with
00:22:24.000 tan on five different things so funny
00:22:26.720 yeah that's maybe you could have just
00:22:27.799 said
00:22:28.520 I enjoy working with but thanks
00:22:31.760 for um yeah I think I began as uh I
00:22:35.760 think to put it
00:22:36.919 suly I began as an artist and a comedian
00:22:40.200 and now I'm exploring my entrepreneurial
00:22:42.080 Side by doing a bunch of different
00:22:44.240 things but I think at the heart of at
00:22:46.840 the heart of it I would I still
00:22:49.799 introduce myself as primarily as a
00:22:52.520 comedian uh you know amongst all the
00:22:54.720 terms like comedian influencer creator
00:22:58.480 entrepreneur I still find saying I'm a
00:23:00.720 comic to be the coolest and or the most
00:23:03.480 accurate version of you feel like in
00:23:05.240 life you associate where you make the
00:23:07.559 most money to your vcation oh that's a
00:23:10.200 very good question ooh super interesting
00:23:13.400 question I
00:23:14.760 think can you rephrase it do you think
00:23:17.080 in life you want to associate yourself
00:23:19.120 with the vocation that makes money if
00:23:21.080 you do five things in life yeah yeah
00:23:23.200 when somebody asks you what do you do do
00:23:25.840 you say where you make the most money
00:23:27.640 cuz I have this question asked me so
00:23:29.720 many times and I wonder what should I
00:23:31.159 say
00:23:32.159 now no I think for me it is I still go
00:23:35.159 back to I I still introduce myself to
00:23:37.480 people who don't know me I'm I first I
00:23:39.400 say is I'm a comedian uh which maybe not
00:23:42.720 not not be the best idea now cuz people
00:23:44.320 often respond with okay this dude is
00:23:45.720 going to be funny or he's going to roast
00:23:47.400 me or whatever but I don't know I find
00:23:49.760 that to be a comedian is like an
00:23:52.960 attitude of just leading life which is
00:23:56.000 you know it's a little
00:23:56.720 anti-establishment
00:23:58.000 inherently a little anti-establishment
00:23:59.559 like so I find that to be the most
00:24:02.440 appealing even now like like someone was
00:24:06.080 telling me the other day saying T you
00:24:08.200 should document your weight loss Journey
00:24:09.799 you should have a camera guy follow you
00:24:11.120 and make those reals and you know where
00:24:12.520 you're losing weight and all that kind
00:24:14.039 of stuff and inherently I was asking
00:24:16.520 myself saying why have I not done that
00:24:17.840 and I feel I feel a little cringy
00:24:20.039 talking about my achievements cuz it's
00:24:22.159 such a it's such a weird thing to to to
00:24:24.919 do whereas comedians are much better off
00:24:27.440 like no comedian wants to get an award
00:24:28.880 comedian want to be at the back of a
00:24:30.720 room making fun of everybody who's
00:24:32.120 gathered here for this thing I'll tell
00:24:33.760 you an interesting story uh I was
00:24:36.240 reading this book some book on
00:24:38.679 History Jesters in courts comedians in
00:24:42.360 history have been part of culture for
00:24:45.760 hundreds of years thousands of years
00:24:48.600 they always had a very relevant and very
00:24:50.880 important role in every Court mhm uh a
00:24:54.559 lot that could not be spoken about open
00:24:58.080 because of societal conditioning the
00:25:00.600 Jester's role was to bring it into
00:25:02.720 people's subconscious while making a
00:25:04.919 joke about it and getting away with it
00:25:07.559 so the very first Jesters had crowns on
00:25:10.360 their head they they had almost the
00:25:13.279 importance in society that a king had
00:25:15.600 because these guys could actually speak
00:25:17.720 their mind where nobody else could
00:25:20.200 that's cuz they were pardoned for
00:25:21.720 speaking the truth yeah yeah so it's
00:25:23.520 inherently anti-establishment so it
00:25:25.000 feels coolest coolest is that why you
00:25:26.960 say comedian yeah I think I think that's
00:25:29.200 why instinctively I want to go to that
00:25:31.000 cuz I still think of it as the coolest
00:25:32.559 term to describe when I think of you I
00:25:34.360 think ad ad maker H now marketing
00:25:38.320 marketing yeah yeah 100% yeah even I
00:25:41.000 think comedian Every Time I Think of You
00:25:43.799 interesting writer and comedian what do
00:25:45.279 you what do you think I think elder
00:25:46.720 brother
00:25:48.320 oh this you know the thing is the
00:25:51.600 thing is every time I see every time I
00:25:53.440 see like a comment that says ran you're
00:25:55.679 just so annoyingly positive all the time
00:25:58.080 etc etc I'm like you guys don't even
00:26:00.039 know the real life version of him he is
00:26:02.480 5X more annoying in person wants to meet
00:26:04.880 you give you a hug kisss you on the
00:26:06.159 cheek it's so frustrating you know when
00:26:08.480 I was younger my mom would watch uh
00:26:12.080 cotti zind
00:26:14.240 and thank you so I have seen a few
00:26:16.960 versions of miir a few versions of Tulsi
00:26:20.960 ganga like all the characters I remember
00:26:23.360 them
00:26:24.279 vaguely ranvir would make such a good MI
00:26:28.279 oh my God that is so true that is so
00:26:31.600 true sorry I got too excited he's like
00:26:32.840 the dream son-in-law you guys are my
00:26:35.159 friends I'm friends with all of you at
00:26:36.600 this table my friends know this about me
00:26:39.000 but for some
00:26:40.559 reason there's a Playboy image that's
00:26:42.720 spread that's really not me dude I want
00:26:44.559 to get married I want to have kids I
00:26:46.240 want to impress my mother-in-law that's

00:26:50.000 Playboy yeah not do I my friends don't
00:26:52.919 but apparently that's become an an
00:26:56.600 image
00:26:58.720 m i I had a I had a series of videos on
00:27:01.679 my Hindi Channel which were basically
00:27:04.440 about personality development okay and
00:27:06.640 the context of the time is this is just
00:27:08.279 when Reliance goo had come out and the
00:27:10.279 internet had become affordable in India
00:27:12.799 so the Indian audiences were waking up
00:27:14.880 to International standards about
00:27:18.080 multiple things now one of the things I
00:27:20.720 figured that people wanted to learn was
00:27:22.360 personality development like learning to
00:27:24.039 speak better English learning table
00:27:25.799 manners learning etiquette uh which we
00:27:28.440 take for granted while we're growing up
00:27:29.919 in urban India I tried making a video
00:27:32.399 called Five personality development tips
00:27:34.360 no one clicked on it then I made a
00:27:36.080 series of videos
00:27:38.919 called okay but the which means how do
00:27:41.840 you impress girls okay but the content
00:27:44.320 was the same it was personality
00:27:45.279 development but that branding stayed
00:27:48.559 till now that's one of the downsides of
00:27:50.640 content creation I've so much to say
00:27:52.120 about the downsides of content creation
00:27:53.440 over the years that um people don't
00:27:56.440 understand that we're growing up in
00:27:57.320 front front of the world we have to
00:27:59.159 inherently and sometimes made to grow up
00:28:02.200 yeah yeah that too you know when I see
00:28:04.679 you yeah I
00:28:06.399 think good guy at
00:28:08.919 heart vulnerable to a large
00:28:12.120 extent
00:28:13.840 but persuaded by too much in life not
00:28:17.799 Playboy at all I feel like overthinking
00:28:20.600 relationships maybe
00:28:22.440 yes over
00:28:24.679 complicating the notion of Roman
00:28:27.960 a romantic relationship and trying to
00:28:29.880 break it down and make it work and all
00:28:31.480 of that maybe yes but not that when I
00:28:33.960 look at
00:28:35.080 tme I see
00:28:37.960 you when I look at tme I see somebody
00:28:41.320 who is about to become a Playboy oh wow
00:28:44.399 the that is why he wants to document his
00:28:46.919 weight loss Journey also on the cliff
00:28:49.799 like you know on the other side is chaos
00:28:52.159 2024 I mean like fun chaos but I I feel
00:28:55.559 like he's he's walking up that cliff and
00:28:57.679 then he's going to go to the other side
00:28:58.919 and dive I know T So intimately because
00:29:02.360 I have my first job in life before I
00:29:04.720 started content creation I was a fitness
00:29:07.080 trainer like right after I'll tell you
00:29:09.279 the story ranir and I started speaking
00:29:11.120 because ranir should send me drunk texts
00:29:12.880 on Facebook Messenger what he would send
00:29:15.080 me he would get drunk and he would text
00:29:16.559 me saying bro I just love you so much I
00:29:18.399 just want I just want to lift weights
00:29:19.720 with you bro I just love you too much
00:29:21.600 like they he used to be so loving that I
00:29:23.200 was like all right all right just come
00:29:24.279 just come this is like in my final
00:29:26.399 semester of engineering College when I
00:29:28.279 knew that I'm not going to go down a
00:29:30.120 traditional route i' got a Fitness
00:29:32.159 certification done and I figured how
00:29:34.360 much money there is to be made as a
00:29:35.840 fitness trainer cuz my ultimate career
00:29:37.360 goal in life was to set up three gyms in
00:29:40.279 Bombay and guys I really tried to get
00:29:42.240 him to not get into content to be fair
00:29:44.320 to me I tried to tell him to do the gym
00:29:47.440 thing but it didn't work out no so one
00:29:50.000 of the things I'm always going to sorry
00:29:51.919 I'm getting romantic with my elder
00:29:53.440 brother oh my God but um there one thing
00:29:56.799 I'll always old to him um so I started
00:30:01.159 training people because it was paying me
00:30:02.679 really well and I was working on this
00:30:04.440 app I wanted to build I wanted to build
00:30:05.840 like an Uber for Fitness coaches you can
00:30:07.960 sit at home and like call a uh train
00:30:10.600 call a yoga session call a weight
00:30:12.440 training session whatever yeah what an
00:30:13.960 awful idea yeah in retrospect I
00:30:16.760 understand it but at that point my only
00:30:18.279 skills were Fitness marketing and like
00:30:20.840 some wild business ideas I just wanted
00:30:22.320 to get started to train myself I started
00:30:25.880 training people actually one of the
00:30:27.919 people I trained was him and this is
00:30:29.799 when influencer marketing didn't even
00:30:31.200 exist in India was this before beer
00:30:33.440 biceps this was just when yeah a little
00:30:36.120 bit before little bit before things took
00:30:38.120 off and um I literally didn't know that
00:30:41.559 influencer marketing existed as a
00:30:43.679 concept tra we we trained for like maybe
00:30:47.320 like a year-ish no no six months stops
00:30:50.760 but those 6 months were like education
00:30:53.080 for me about um the wave that was going
00:30:56.240 to come which eventually let to the
00:30:57.480 formation of Monk entertainment which
00:30:58.799 led to me quitting fitness training so
00:31:01.440 thanks no but that happens when you talk
00:31:03.519 to tan every time I have spent time
00:31:06.120 talking to him there's always so much
00:31:08.760 Insight in just not what not what's
00:31:11.440 happening now but what's going to
00:31:14.760 happen so a lot of the conversation
00:31:17.080 today because I was thinking about it
00:31:18.360 after we left also was what's going to
00:31:20.960 happen and what the next step should be
00:31:22.600 and what he wants to do so I like the
00:31:24.320 fact that he's always been someone I
00:31:25.919 feel like who's always thought of the
00:31:27.559 next step and take it forward and that's
00:31:29.279 helped a lot uh that's been very helpful
00:31:31.960 for creators like us a lot because we
00:31:34.559 didn't have that uh um knowledge or we
00:31:37.880 didn't have wisdom to even know where is
00:31:40.799 this going and how to take this forward
00:31:42.320 but this is a this is an annoying habit
00:31:43.960 of mine which is when I meet other
00:31:45.639 creators uh I really like to tell them
00:31:48.360 what I'm at all what I'm thinking but
00:31:50.200 it's it's it's got to be with someone
00:31:51.960 where you think there's a safe space
00:31:53.240 where you can really talk about what
00:31:54.559 you're thinking without them being like
00:31:59.080 do you still think about
00:32:00.440 aib uh yeah cuz it shows up on my
00:32:03.559 timeline every now and then and I watch
00:32:04.880 the videos and I'm like still good still
00:32:07.279 good it is yeah it's still good I think
00:32:09.600 Comedians and politicians together form
00:32:12.120 some of the smartest people in society I
00:32:14.919 want to I want to take that and just
00:32:16.320 want to widen the widen it a little bit
00:32:19.799 like me and you have discussed that I
00:32:21.320 think a lot of the traits that
00:32:23.360 politicians need which is effectively
00:32:25.760 Mass manipulation is what Creator SL
00:32:28.720 influencers need today we're going to
00:32:30.279 have a Creator president very soon yeah
00:32:33.000 we almost did with Trump but yeah like a
00:32:34.960 YouTuber president is going to happen
00:32:36.559 it's going to happen right that's that's
00:32:37.760 a good one actually it's very possible
00:32:39.960 you learn too much and you have access
00:32:41.720 to too much data like you you're able to
00:32:44.240 almost I I don't want it sounds arrogant
00:32:46.039 to say you can almost predict the future
00:32:47.919 but when you have that much data you can
00:32:49.840 almost predict the future but you also
00:32:51.360 get trained on criticism you get trained
00:32:54.360 how to block negative comments like you
00:32:56.440 you really get this like crash course
00:32:58.399 like I feel like if I run for prime
00:33:00.000 minister of any country I feel like I'm
00:33:02.639 ready I'm ready what are you going to
00:33:04.120 get okay you're going to say bad things
00:33:05.480 okay I already get them now uh you know
00:33:07.519 I need to make videos okay we're already
00:33:08.679 making the videos we have the editors
00:33:10.799 like you want a slogan for the campaign
00:33:12.240 we have the marketers like what else do
00:33:13.600 you need that's it you just need to
00:33:15.840 reach a million people do you think that
00:33:17.639 could happen here in
00:33:19.559 India uh I think so yeah I think in 10
00:33:22.880 years time is anybody on the cusp do you
00:33:25.679 see any politicians bar creators anit
00:33:29.679 Bay you know him Ram b r ban the guy who
00:33:34.000 75 hard is he a politician now he's not
00:33:36.919 but someone like that could gain that
00:33:38.679 much um that much distribution in fact I
00:33:41.960 think um there's like a mix of like I
00:33:45.159 think newer age politicians will be a
00:33:46.720 lot more digitally Savvy like you take
00:33:49.080 someone like Viv uh in in the US right
00:33:51.559 VI ramaswami he's a Creator every day
00:33:55.120 there's a schedule and he goes and
00:33:56.559 shoots something and there's like five
00:33:58.159 clips of it that come out and you have
00:34:00.960 to be a a Creator quote unquote if but
00:34:04.919 do you think the voting audience is
00:34:06.399 essentially I don't think it'll happen
00:34:07.600 in India anytime soon how many how many
00:34:09.560 million smartphones in India now nikil
00:34:12.280 600 million 67 million that's that's
00:34:14.800 your that's your word Pace cuz they all
00:34:16.560 they all are watching stuff um I think
00:34:18.839 all eyeballs are going to be through the
00:34:20.280 phone now so you will have to be a
00:34:22.000 Creator if you want Mass Appeal like
00:34:23.879 that I think it'll happen in a 30
00:34:25.520 million pop by that logic would have
00:34:27.440 assumed more TVs in India than
00:34:29.760 smartphones or access to TV so I would
00:34:31.960 have thought TV actors would have become
00:34:33.800 po but that time is changing I mean film
00:34:37.560 yeah we had Bollywood kind of going that
00:34:39.879 way not not truly not in a manner where
00:34:44.560 it moved the needle per H so I've I've
00:34:48.599 asked some friends of mine from the
00:34:51.199 world of politics this question and by
00:34:53.520 that I don't mean politicians I mean
00:34:55.280 people who work in I don't know how you
00:34:57.359 frame this like in during the elections
00:34:59.359 they help with like bureaucrats no no
00:35:01.480 yeah also bureaucrats advisor lobbying
00:35:03.440 but like there's a lot of work that goes
00:35:06.040 behind uh even carrying out an election
00:35:09.760 and then from the political parties
00:35:11.760 there's a lot of work that goes into
00:35:13.480 swaying the vote in One Direction in
00:35:15.320 different constituencies so there is a
00:35:18.200 whole other skill set involved when
00:35:19.839 you're actually beginning that political
00:35:21.079 career in order to win the elections but
00:35:22.880 it's a learnable skill set and I think
00:35:24.599 this content creator thing is actually
00:35:25.960 the bigger skill set about like
00:35:27.079 affecting masses uh I I think there so
00:35:29.480 there's this YouTube channel I've
00:35:30.400 followed for years it's called Charisma
00:35:31.800 on command it's one of my favorite
00:35:33.079 YouTube channels ever highly recommended
00:35:34.800 nice it's about social skills and it's
00:35:36.480 about media skills I think so much of
00:35:38.320 media's communication and what what
00:35:40.760 people understand from the words you're
00:35:42.240 saying uh they analyze Trump and I think
00:35:45.640 most people know this about Trump now
00:35:46.920 but he would say very basic things
00:35:50.240 repeatedly yeah that's actually what
00:35:52.400 content is in the long term when people
00:35:54.520 think of your brand as a content creator
00:35:56.760 they'll associate certain words with you
00:35:58.160 like with me I know it's positivity
00:35:59.400 motivation beer biceps is my favorite
00:36:01.760 YouTube channel that's interesting what
00:36:04.240 is it with you guys what is your
00:36:06.079 Narrative of you you're trying to put
00:36:08.079 off me H okay um that I'm generally
00:36:13.319 curious I you you can't fake it the
00:36:16.200 thing is if you're a regular creative
00:36:18.319 especially if you're going to be
00:36:19.240 consistent you can't fake it so my
00:36:21.839 strategy would be what am I naturally
00:36:23.400 curious about and just turn that into
00:36:24.680 content cuz that automatically makes the
00:36:26.280 most version of you go out um but you
00:36:30.359 can't fake who you are at least not for
00:36:33.079 very long but you can control showing
00:36:34.920 people how much of you like you you can
00:36:37.760 do that like is that accurate yeah I
00:36:40.319 think so especially podcast it's
00:36:42.760 impossible after one hour podcast this
00:36:45.119 is who you really are yeah yeah like
00:36:47.200 that's why presidents you really don't
00:36:49.480 go on podcast more than one hour or two
00:36:50.920 hours it becomes you know the third hour
00:36:52.560 is like that's where you make the
00:36:53.520 mistakes that's why n shoots for like
00:36:55.359 six yeah but me this each of us deep
00:36:59.200 down are completely different not
00:37:01.839 completely but slightly different from
00:37:04.040 what we project cuz we we all are darker
00:37:06.920 right I think any philosopher would say
00:37:10.880 Mar used to say this right like a prince
00:37:13.920 needs to project AB bcde e but he
00:37:17.119 actually has to be something else like
00:37:19.640 being generous I'll take one of the
00:37:21.680 examples like being generous for a
00:37:23.800 prince or a king is not a good thing
00:37:26.200 because if you're a king and generous
00:37:28.560 people get accustomed to your generosity
00:37:30.720 and they forget a world before that and
00:37:33.000 then you have to increase taxes to
00:37:35.079 continue to be generous and when you do
00:37:37.160 that they go after you so as a king you
00:37:40.440 need to be a completely different thing
00:37:42.680 but you need to
00:37:43.960 project a bunch of things you know
00:37:46.480 virtuous moralistic
00:37:49.200 generosity uh ritualistic
00:37:52.079 religious these are things when you
00:37:54.119 project upon a society that resonates
00:37:56.720 with you mhm uh the odds of you staying
00:38:00.319 in power for longer are probably higher
00:38:02.800 so when you say
00:38:04.599 authentic do you mean truly authentic or
00:38:07.839 do you mean this mask that you're
00:38:09.560 projecting which is slightly authentic
00:38:11.640 but not auth authentic enough to get you
00:38:14.000 to trouble interesting so I like to
00:38:15.599 think of it as you know in if you're
00:38:17.520 playing FIFA and you select a character
00:38:19.599 you have like seven attributes show up
00:38:22.200 so the digital version of authentic
00:38:23.760 would be what are some of the attributes
00:38:25.359 that are actually true right and those
00:38:28.000 are the ones you choose to project cuz
00:38:30.560 that's what's that's what's the closest
00:38:32.640 version of you but you can't truly be
00:38:34.839 fully authentic that's a that's a su
00:38:37.400 that gets you into trouble 100% because
00:38:39.480 nobody's fully clean and unfortunately
00:38:41.400 when you got to be when you got to be
00:38:43.599 public you got to try clean is the wrong
00:38:46.119 word I feel like every human has
00:38:48.359 different personalities a side and B
00:38:50.280 side he has a outside and he has a
00:38:52.000 shadow I've met hundreds of creators and
00:38:53.640 I think you guys can can relate to this
00:38:55.480 you you see their content and and then
00:38:56.680 you meet them and actually the thing
00:38:57.920 that surprised me the most is that most
00:39:00.119 creators are extroverted in the camera
00:39:03.000 they're very excited they're very
00:39:04.280 energetic but when you meet them they're
00:39:05.920 like in the corner just by themselves
00:39:07.839 like not talking to anybody they're like
00:39:10.040 wait is this the same person so I I
00:39:12.079 think the yeah you're right there's
00:39:13.319 still extroversion versus introversion
00:39:16.160 most creators are actually introverted
00:39:18.079 that I realize which is shocking they
00:39:20.079 only like talking to a camera they don't
00:39:21.480 like talking to humans um so there there
00:39:24.440 is a dissonance there is a difference
00:39:26.040 between what you see on YouTube and what
00:39:28.040 you see in real life and I would even
00:39:29.839 argue that we're all a bit more than
00:39:34.119 what we make our videos about 100% yeah
00:39:36.839 so you're saying in summary there is a
00:39:39.280 young Creator who young wannabe Cur
00:39:42.000 Creator content
00:39:43.599 creator nice
00:39:46.400 Spider-Man
00:39:47.960 spense say a young
00:39:51.280 20-year-old wannabe entrepreneur trying
00:39:54.319 to build distribution through content
00:39:57.880 creation what we are saying is he has to
00:40:00.599 be authentic but to the
00:40:05.160 extent that is acceptable in the
00:40:08.280 societal Norms that he lives under and
00:40:10.839 he still has to do one or two things to
00:40:12.680 resonate with the audience there has to
00:40:14.760 be authenticity but not not beyond the
00:40:18.079 point but n isn't that true for
00:40:20.680 everything isn't it true for anytime you
00:40:23.480 are effectively speaking to an audience
00:40:26.680 be it as an entrepreneur talking to a
00:40:28.079 thousand employees in the company I
00:40:30.400 think anytime there is a major public
00:40:32.720 interaction there is a degree of
00:40:34.160 performance MH that almost is
00:40:36.839 uncontrollable it just even if you're
00:40:38.599 not speaking to anybody why do people
00:40:40.000 dress up yeah why do you put your nicest
00:40:42.240 clothes because you want to show a
00:40:43.839 different version of who you really are
00:40:45.079 why do people put makeup on that's human
00:40:47.599 nature I think so we shouldn't blame it
00:40:49.359 on the creators for being different in
00:40:51.720 front of an audience yeah for sure uh I
00:40:54.359 mean no one's blaming cre I think n is
00:40:56.079 is delving into the I'm trying to figure
00:40:58.160 out what works yeah I I have a compass I
00:41:00.880 follow when it comes to this
00:41:02.240 authenticity thought uh in my head is
00:41:05.520 that the larger the quantity of content
00:41:08.000 that you release the closer you get to
00:41:09.680 your actual authenticity but ideally you
00:41:12.319 shouldn't go to 100% because of the
00:41:15.040 second point which is that everything
00:41:16.839 you say should be true but not
00:41:18.839 everything that's true should be
00:41:20.520 said you got a lot of hate right like
00:41:23.720 recently and I've tried to like
00:41:26.960 I know ranir for a long time okay I know
00:41:29.359 ranir
00:41:30.880 from a few years ago when he was younger
00:41:34.079 and I remember him interviewing me or
00:41:36.200 doing a podcast we did one together and
00:41:38.760 I was like this guy is so good he
00:41:41.760 organically has a way to put you put you
00:41:45.720 so at ease that you're so comfortable
00:41:48.119 talking to him and he's agreed and he's
00:41:50.520 always been such a nice guy through and
00:41:52.720 through when people were saying so much
00:41:54.680 crap about him I was like you know I
00:41:57.520 called him up I I do call him up and I
00:41:59.359 say you know like don't take this to
00:42:01.280 Heart Like if somebody's making the
00:42:02.839 effort to look up ran search him on
00:42:05.319 Twitter and then go there and write a
00:42:08.280 comment yeah but how do you put up with
00:42:10.480 that but that's a big part of being a
00:42:12.200 content creator right yeah I'll give you
00:42:13.800 the 100% honest answer I went through a
00:42:17.079  hole of a phase in engineering
00:42:18.760 college and it just blew all the
00:42:20.559 emotions out of me and like I was just
00:42:23.040 left emotionless by the end of
00:42:24.440 engineering College that's not true
00:42:27.119 you're very emotional maybe I can
00:42:28.920 compartmentalize it well but I I'll tell
00:42:31.200 you there's been two phases where hate
00:42:32.960 has affected me the first time was when
00:42:35.480 I first had a viral video like an allout
00:42:37.559 National viral video where I spoke about
00:42:40.200 Amir Khan Amir Khan and Amir Khan you
00:42:42.920 know am Khan is uh he had a big Fitness
00:42:45.680 transformation and at that point oh yes
00:42:48.760 I made a video about how it's probably
00:42:50.640 not completely natural oh wow and uh it
00:42:53.119 was just a suggest suggestive video but
00:42:54.720 that's the first time I blew up as a
00:42:56.319 Fitness content creator the second time
00:42:59.000 was fairly recently where so I've been
00:43:01.400 cancelled a lot on Twitter over the last
00:43:03.800 like since Co began like since does it
00:43:05.839 get easier yeah what do you do like
00:43:09.480 these young people we are encouraging to
00:43:11.240 build distribution to sell the brands
00:43:13.160 they later create they will get
00:43:15.079 cancelled yeah so is it best to like
00:43:18.200 shut up when you're getting canceled and
00:43:19.680 ignore it um what is like a tip it's
00:43:23.880 it's too subjective because the
00:43:25.240 cancelling
00:43:26.680 sometimes it's truly your fault and if
00:43:28.680 it is you should like address it uh yeah
00:43:31.760 but I also want to push back against the
00:43:33.319 word cancel there's no such thing as
00:43:36.119 cancel you cannot be canceled on the
00:43:38.319 internet it is the algorithm has no
00:43:40.119 emotions you see the algorithm is like
00:43:41.960 right ring or left ring it doesn't care
00:43:43.599 you create content it's interesting
00:43:45.160 enough it shows it to people so you can
00:43:46.920 say you're cancelled but you come back
00:43:48.680 next video and you get the same number
00:43:50.119 of views if not more the question is
00:43:52.200 what do you do when there's push back
00:43:53.640 from the audience and the way you should
00:43:55.720 look at it is push back is the most
00:43:57.760 positive thing that can happen to you as
00:44:00.000 a Creator if you get cancelled or pushed
00:44:02.960 back you have cracked it yes you are
00:44:05.880 finally relevant enough to hate it it
00:44:08.960 it's very the opposite of the opposite
00:44:10.640 of Love isn't hate it's indifference
00:44:12.520 yeah exactly opposite of Love is that
00:44:15.000 true in this very true people again
00:44:17.720 we're using the word canceled because of
00:44:19.200 a lack of other words to describe that
00:44:21.280 situation where you're receiving a
00:44:22.920 tsunami of criticism on the internet uh
00:44:26.359 now it boils down to who you are
00:44:27.640 subjectively on the inside as a content
00:44:29.160 creator are you someone will absorb all
00:44:31.280 of it and feel bad about it or are you
00:44:32.720 someone will absorb all of it take the
00:44:35.280 the feedback and then improve your
00:44:36.920 content for me my game has always been
00:44:39.200 quantity you need to know your own game
00:44:41.200 and your own strengths as a content
00:44:42.760 creator not I'm not the smartest not the
00:44:45.000 most creative Creator but I can create a
00:44:47.280 huge amount of content that amount is
00:44:50.200 good enough for you to show your
00:44:51.680 improvement show that you absorb the
00:44:53.400 feedback and eventually those same
00:44:55.680 people people who've been pissed off
00:44:57.000 with you for that one thing will say
00:44:58.240 okay we've noticed now that you've
00:45:00.760 corrected your mistakes and admitted to
00:45:02.400 doing the wrong and in some cases where
00:45:04.800 if you don't agree with what you're
00:45:06.040 being canceled for don't respond so
00:45:09.400 people need to understand another thing
00:45:10.800 is that creators are change makers when
00:45:13.280 you make a video you are affecting
00:45:15.000 change in the world every time you want
00:45:17.839 to change something there is resistance
00:45:19.920 if I try to change the location of this
00:45:22.359 cup there is resistance of the cup
00:45:24.680 towards my change if you try to change a
00:45:26.720 country there is resistance that's why
00:45:28.800 every politician in the world gets death
00:45:30.960 threats because they are the ones who
00:45:32.480 are making the most change is that
00:45:33.599 something a Creator should actively do
00:45:36.000 uh if he is anti let me not say
00:45:39.200 establishment but anti- public opinion
00:45:42.599 he gets more traction you will get more
00:45:45.000 yes you will get more traction if you
00:45:46.319 are that so is that a hack like you look
00:45:48.559 at in general extreme opinions will get
00:45:50.920 more traction yeah the hope is that your
00:45:53.400 extreme opinion is not bad why is that
00:45:56.839 like because the negative feedback loop
00:45:59.079 sooes sooths our psyche in some weird
00:46:01.720 manner if everybody is saying a certain
00:46:04.400 restaurant is good and if you were to go
00:46:06.920 online and say this restaurant is
00:46:09.000 crap don't go there bad bad
00:46:11.400 bad more I feel like we also love
00:46:15.119 drama a strong opinion about anything
00:46:19.040 creates a market for the antithesis of
00:46:21.760 that opinion by itself because everyone
00:46:25.319 is on line trying to build a brand one
00:46:28.359 of the easiest ways to build a brand is
00:46:29.960 to be contrarian so every single strong
00:46:33.240 opinion automatically creates the
00:46:35.760 opposite market so unfortunately in
00:46:38.720 social media every year there's roughly
00:46:41.079 like six to seven opportunities to go
00:46:43.800 guaranteed viral guaranteed right any
00:46:46.280 video you make about a topic it will go
00:46:47.800 viral unfortunately a lot of people
00:46:49.440 utilize that just to get attention for
00:46:51.400 example Israel and Palestine right now
00:46:53.680 anybody make a pro Palestine video I I
00:46:56.000 guarantee you millions of views uh few
00:46:58.319 years ago there were wildfires in
00:47:00.160 Australia anybody that made any video
00:47:02.800 about that oh there was protest in
00:47:04.040 Bangladesh anybody Farmers protest in
00:47:06.440 India these are all opportunities for
00:47:08.839 Content creators to get attention even
00:47:11.400 if they don't care about the topic and
00:47:12.880 this is just take a contrary this is not
00:47:14.720 not just the cont this is everyone n
00:47:17.920 this not the contrary they're saying
00:47:18.960 like if everybody saying okay we need to
00:47:20.520 protest with the farmers for example
00:47:22.000 which I didn't understand what what it
00:47:23.200 was about uh you will get the views you
00:47:25.400 will be become famous in those six
00:47:27.240 chances every year and I've seen people
00:47:29.680 who know nothing about Indian politics
00:47:32.240 or local Indian Affairs just like
00:47:35.040 Rihanna
00:47:37.319 oh that's the one now I remember Rihanna
00:47:40.480 was like I'm with the IND was like what
00:47:41.880 did rean know about this yeah but it
00:47:44.440 became cool to say that it became cool
00:47:46.079 to say that tribalism right now has it
00:47:49.480 become cool to say Pro Palestinian stuff
00:47:52.839 it's become cool why is that because
00:47:56.400 there's two billion Muslims in the world
00:47:59.040 and now the minute you promote and you
00:48:01.800 support this topic every Muslim will
00:48:03.480 want to support you as well so you see
00:48:05.200 that tribalism happen even if people
00:48:07.319 don't know the intricacies of this very
00:48:09.760 complicated conflict which I'm part of
00:48:11.520 for 75 years if things were this easy
00:48:14.119 man it would have been solved I I want
00:48:16.400 to understand like I've heard every side
00:48:19.319 there is we don't have enough hours in
00:48:21.000 this podcast for this no give us like
00:48:23.079 give us a brief history of you you're a
00:48:26.480 Arab Israeli so I'm I'm I'm Israeli
00:48:31.119 Palestinian explain where were you born
00:48:33.640 start from the beginning this this I'm
00:48:36.200 curious about genuinely a fascinating
00:48:38.599 story like interesting St look when
00:48:40.240 people look at Israel they think a
00:48:42.760 country for Jewish people what they
00:48:44.760 don't understand is that 20% of that
00:48:47.280 country is not Jewish and what they
00:48:49.040 don't understand is when Israel came to
00:48:50.960 existence uh there there were other
00:48:52.920 people living there and some people left
00:48:55.200 some people people got kicked out some
00:48:56.680 people died and some people stayed
00:48:58.599 inside so my ancestors are the ones who
00:49:01.400 stayed under Israel so one day we woke
00:49:03.799 up we're like okay we're Israeli
00:49:05.720 citizens okay so there were a certain
00:49:07.480 number of Jews there there were a
00:49:08.880 certain number of Arabs all of these
00:49:11.559 were the West Bank Gaza Golan Heights
00:49:14.599 everything in between was one country
00:49:16.880 did it have a border it was was was it a
00:49:19.760 Sovereign Nation was it one no there was
00:49:22.160 there was the British Empire it was the
00:49:23.680 man British it was a British Mand
00:49:26.119 and then before that it was the Ottomans
00:49:27.760 so it's very complicated to like
00:49:30.880 actually say oh there was one country
00:49:33.359 here but there were actual people living
00:49:35.119 there the land that belonged to the
00:49:37.079 Palestinians in my naive yes the little
00:49:40.880 bit of information from the few books
00:49:42.480 I've read kind of information The
00:49:44.760 Landmark that they had has been
00:49:47.000 consistently going down with time for
00:49:48.680 for the average person who doesn't want
00:49:49.880 to go to the details there was 11
00:49:51.240 opportunities for peace and they were
00:49:52.920 squandered for different reasons
00:49:54.599 sometimes it was Israel's fault fault
00:49:56.160 and many times it was palestine's fault
00:49:58.599 right but eventually the leaders in
00:50:01.119 these positions have come to realize it
00:50:03.359 is more popular to wage a war than to
00:50:06.200 wage peace in the Middle East more
00:50:08.720 politicians died from Making Peace than
00:50:12.200 from making War explain I'm going to say
00:50:14.160 that again more politicians died from
00:50:16.480 Making Peace than from making War Sadat
00:50:19.480 made peace with Israel the Egyptian guy
00:50:21.559 Egyptian president made peace with with
00:50:23.319 Israel got assassinated RAB in Palestine
00:50:26.599 made peace wanted to make peace got
00:50:28.680 assassinated why why the algorithm wants
00:50:31.240 War the algorithm wants War I mean
00:50:33.640 eventually an extremist will come and be
00:50:35.280 like oh this politician is gonna end my
00:50:38.119 struggle which is my struggle for a
00:50:40.319 whole country and they're going to only
00:50:42.319 settle for half I'm gonna kill
00:50:44.640 them while if a politician wages War
00:50:47.880 it's like ah yeah this politician is
00:50:49.240 standing for what I want so that so
00:50:52.920 that's when I realized oh my God that's
00:50:54.319 why North Korea is is like We'll always
00:50:56.640 stay North Korea if if the if the if the
00:50:59.440 president tries to do anything different
00:51:01.520 he's the first to be
00:51:03.440 assassinated
00:51:05.200 so assassinated by by people in North
00:51:08.440 Korea who want to keep the status quo
00:51:11.040 basically the people who have gained
00:51:14.400 affluence proximity to that person
00:51:16.799 something like that something like that
00:51:18.079 and eventually in nutshell as much as we
00:51:20.240 all want peace peace is a very
00:51:22.319 politically risky move and that's why
00:51:25.920 in in the last week no one is calling
00:51:27.880 for peace because it's also risky for
00:51:29.480 Content creators I made a video calling
00:51:31.319 for peace a week ago and I got 100 death
00:51:34.480 threats why did I get 100 death threats
00:51:36.599 for calling for pece because this is the
00:51:40.079 time to call for justice for war for
00:51:43.599 getting back what what we deserve and
00:51:45.400 all that stuff the algorithm wants War
00:51:47.520 like that to me encapsulates but the
00:51:49.599 human algorithm exactly the human
00:51:51.559 algorithm wants Justice the algorithm is
00:51:53.440 very human the algorithm Bally telling
00:51:55.559 you what people want yeah I love like I
00:51:59.079 love and respect and admire um just no
00:52:02.480 being able to talk about this with this
00:52:04.079 much cion cuz I don't know if I have the
00:52:06.240 courage given where you know what what
00:52:08.640 he has been through and or what he might
00:52:10.400 go through to bring it back to content
00:52:13.640 creators this is why we need content
00:52:16.559 creators who are able to say what they
00:52:18.559 really want to say even if it costs them
00:52:20.680 their their life yes you can create
00:52:23.079 content and make money you can create
00:52:25.040 cont and build a business but the point
00:52:27.119 of content creation is as you said
00:52:28.839 social change we must change the
00:52:31.520 narrative on Muslims on Jews on Israel
00:52:34.520 and Palestine on India Pakistan I think
00:52:36.960 that's why we're all here but there's a
00:52:39.440 different kind of content creator who
00:52:40.599 wants to entertain and that is also good
00:52:42.599 too so ask yourself do you want to be a
00:52:45.359 content creator to build a business to
00:52:48.480 entertain or to educate how far do you
00:52:51.440 think the first content creator
00:52:52.880 assassination is oo I think it probably
00:52:56.520 already happened yeah to a female
00:52:58.799 content creator somewhere in the
00:53:00.640 world I think but the point he made is
00:53:03.200 so relevant I feel like with a
00:53:06.920 cooperation disseminating news they're
00:53:09.480 bound to be biased in one form or
00:53:11.440 another I think the role of a content
00:53:14.200 creator in getting their actual story
00:53:16.520 out is so incredibly important for the
00:53:18.880 world right yeah it's indep it's
00:53:22.119 independent thought needs to be
00:53:23.880 encouraged but I I also think that look
00:53:27.559 there it's it's it's easy to say that
00:53:29.240 everybody should be able to voice their
00:53:31.520 opinion um but voicing your opinion is a
00:53:35.319 not necessary not necessarily the best
00:53:38.040 thing for business which most bus let's
00:53:41.520 be honest most content creators are in
00:53:43.200 the pursuit of being brand friendly
00:53:44.680 enough that they can make a living that
00:53:46.880 they can make a living uh but I also say
00:53:51.119 that you want to be king first before
00:53:52.839 you become a philosopher right like Shah
00:53:55.480 ruk Khan like Shah sh shuk said this
00:53:57.359 right um so you want you want to feel
00:54:00.400 secure financially before you're able to
00:54:03.359 voice your thought very very publicly at
00:54:06.359 least this is what I have maintained
00:54:08.480 that I think if I feel extremely secure
00:54:11.160 financially it actually the thing you're
00:54:12.920 that you're buying by making money is
00:54:15.079 freedom to express yes if I am able to
00:54:18.000 devoid my Revenue income from what I say
00:54:21.640 publicly that's the ideal word this is
00:54:23.920 why I agree with n and he says that if
00:54:25.799 you build distribution you want to build
00:54:27.119 businesses under it so you have an
00:54:28.880 infrastructure around you that can
00:54:30.480 continue to exist without being
00:54:32.839 dependent on what the comment section
00:54:34.079 says about you such a good point and I
00:54:37.359 want to give this advice to anybody
00:54:38.960 that's starting content brands are not
00:54:41.920 your friends brands are not friends your
00:54:45.319 friends brands are the first to chicken
00:54:47.880 out when you get cancelled when you get
00:54:49.440 push back like I lost a couple of brand
00:54:51.319 deals in the last month I'm sure you
00:54:52.520 lost brand deals in your life we've all
00:54:54.000 lost brand deals in life there are lots
00:54:56.359 because of something you said R you too
00:54:58.720 not yet have you ever been cancelled or
00:55:00.559 pushed back
00:55:02.480 um not not yet if you have to think that
00:55:05.200 long no so maybe this is the time say
00:55:08.400 something oh
00:55:09.880 Lord but I I was talking to TMA about
00:55:12.440 this and I agreed to what he said about
00:55:14.440 the whole opinion bit of it what I was
00:55:15.920 telling him I was like I'm so nervous
00:55:17.200 about this because a lot of times I'm so
00:55:18.920 unaware and there are so many things
00:55:21.000 that I'm constantly kind of educating
00:55:22.880 myself because it's a huge world you put
00:55:25.400 yourself out there you know like you are
00:55:27.599 there's a lot of expectations of
00:55:29.240 comments about so many things that
00:55:31.799 especially in a country like ours where
00:55:33.400 it's such a mix of people with different
00:55:36.920 likes and different kind of content that
00:55:39.119 you watch and different issues that we
00:55:40.559 kind of living it's like 15 countries in
00:55:42.119 a comment section right like it's like
00:55:43.760 it's so mixed um so for someone like me
00:55:47.599 I I'm terrible at multitasking if I am
00:55:49.720 doing one thing I'm literally not
00:55:51.079 watching anything else I'm not reading
00:55:52.839 anything else I'm not educating myself
00:55:54.359 about anything else if I'm like for
00:55:55.839 example right now I'm writing a book and
00:55:57.599 that's all I'm doing I'm so unaware
00:55:59.599 about so many things which is why this
00:56:01.079 is this is a very informative
00:56:03.640 conversation for me because I now have
00:56:06.599 context to a lot of things which I
00:56:08.400 should have because I understand the
00:56:09.760 responsibility that comes from being
00:56:11.119 someone who speaks out and who has
00:56:13.760 impact so that is something that I'm
00:56:15.520 constantly working on so I feel like for
00:56:18.039 someone like me it just it it is a tough
00:56:21.240 space when it comes to uh having that
00:56:24.240 opinion so if I was a brand I would
00:56:26.359 throw all my money at you as they have
00:56:28.960 as
00:56:29.960 they because you are so safe I can
00:56:32.680 associate with you and you'll never be
00:56:34.640 cancelled for saying something stupid
00:56:36.880 about Israel and Palestine so so that's
00:56:39.039 why this is a good strategy actually to
00:56:41.240 to build a good
00:56:42.400 business unfortunately we have a big
00:56:44.680 mouth and so I've realized that now that
00:56:47.920 I lost a million dollars from making
00:56:49.319 that video from a brand
00:56:51.400 deal Community is the one thing that
00:56:54.200 will stick with you no matter what you
00:56:55.680 say yeah so now I'm building only
00:56:57.880 community based businesses that's I give
00:57:00.319 me an example of what you mean by
00:57:01.680 community community based business is
00:57:03.079 basically I want to make my money not
00:57:04.799 from a brand that gives me $100,000 to
00:57:07.680 make a video whatever I want to make my
00:57:09.400 money from selling a product to the
00:57:11.160 people that follow me everywhere around
00:57:12.920 the world for example it's Nas travels
00:57:16.000 so we're creating this group trips
00:57:17.559 product where we take you on a trip to
00:57:19.079 Ecuador to see Ecuador for a week
00:57:21.960 together so even if I get canceled by a
00:57:24.559 brand
00:57:25.720 and a person buying my product in
00:57:27.880 Colombia does not care that actually
00:57:30.640 makes sense yeah are you doing that too
00:57:34.119 yeah I'm working on building businesses
00:57:36.760 that can Leverage The distribution that
00:57:39.160 I have and I think this is a good
00:57:41.000 strategy for every Creator especially if
00:57:44.160 I mean a lot of creators who aren't in
00:57:46.119 the entertainment section usually
00:57:48.359 already have this built-in like you know
00:57:50.640 sharan for example has already thought
00:57:52.599 of it a lot of folks who are into educ
00:57:54.960 ation have ech to fall on but it usually
00:57:57.720 it's folks in the entertainment section
00:57:59.400 that kind of have to think about well
00:58:01.119 what is the business that I'm going to
00:58:02.119 build cuz my whole business is I'm going
00:58:04.520 to play an ad in the middle of
00:58:05.799 entertaining you uh so one of my Natural
00:58:09.599 Instincts was I love writing content and
00:58:12.119 I've written comedy my whole life so
00:58:13.680 writing advertising marketing that sort
00:58:15.480 of stuff came naturally to me I moved to
00:58:17.520 Bangalore I realized that oh there's
00:58:19.359 there's a there's a big section here
00:58:21.760 that could do with some of my advice and
00:58:23.400 so I start you know advising startups
00:58:25.559 and that that sort of thing but this is
00:58:27.400 super useful advice and I think NS is
00:58:29.000 the king of this NS has done such a good
00:58:31.359 job like no one understands video like
00:58:32.760 him so now he produces video and it's a
00:58:35.319 Playbook that he taught his company and
00:58:36.880 now this company can scale for him so
00:58:38.400 tomorrow if a brand doesn't work nozar
00:58:40.079 is still okay and I think this I truly
00:58:42.160 believe that a everyone should be making
00:58:44.559 content because it teaches you sales
00:58:46.880 yeah across the board and really what do
00:58:48.920 you need to be successful you is that
00:58:50.319 making content at the end of the day
00:58:51.960 learning how to make sales marketing if
00:58:54.440 you I would if I were hiring for
00:58:56.160 marketing if there was a kid who could
00:58:58.240 take an Instagram page from 0 to 10,000
00:59:00.920 that kid is killer right most CMOS don't
00:59:03.480 know how to do this most CMOS would not
00:59:05.880 know where to spend money to make this
00:59:07.559 happen in fact people who are in
00:59:09.480 marketing jobs at Brands what they're
00:59:11.400 truly doing is exercising the judgment
00:59:13.359 on what's good or not they're spending
00:59:14.760 Dollar on making a decision how do you
00:59:17.480 know what's good or not if you haven't
00:59:18.760 done it 20 times over and seeing what's
00:59:20.599 good or no so I truly think most people
00:59:22.440 who make content content today if you
00:59:24.480 have have this experience for 10 years
00:59:26.280 there is a very good marketing job at
00:59:28.480 the end of it do you think that's
00:59:29.880 another pathway like we 100% we thought
00:59:32.920 of build influence
00:59:35.160 distribution start a business fashion
00:59:37.920 restaurant SAS software whatever
00:59:40.799 sell another part could be build
00:59:43.760 distribution get hired yes build
00:59:45.640 distribution get hired in fact I think
00:59:47.280 like nsar mentioned earlier there's
00:59:48.559 going to be a whole batch of creators
00:59:50.039 who you know who after 5 years of
00:59:52.119 traction realize that this might not
00:59:53.520 happen marketing is a super interesting
00:59:56.520 and useful career that they can get into
00:59:58.200 almost immediately because they know
00:59:59.200 more than most marketers very
01:00:01.640 interesting before we get into the
01:00:03.799 influencer influencer buts uh broadly oh
01:00:07.920 we haven't gotten into it we're going
01:00:11.520 to there's a reason why this goes on for
01:00:13.799 5 hours this goes on for 5 hours content
01:00:16.000 creator economy how big is it in 2021 I
01:00:19.880 remember this number there was this
01:00:21.760 whole U article about how
01:00:25.160 the Creator economy has added 10,000
01:00:27.599 crores to the Indian GDP it's
01:00:29.839 contributed 10,000 crores to the Indian
01:00:32.079 GDP uh I don't you would be a better
01:00:35.440 person to break that down what I
01:00:38.079 understand is it's created that kind of
01:00:39.920 employment that kind of influencer
01:00:42.160 marketing spends Etc we've been in the
01:00:45.319 space for eight I've been in the space
01:00:46.760 for eight years T has been in it longer
01:00:49.280 we've constantly seen an increase in
01:00:51.920 influencer marketing rates as long as
01:00:54.200 you stick to the game that's where I
01:00:55.720 anticipate it's going but the space
01:00:57.079 itself you started at the very beginning
01:00:58.799 of it like he started at the very 10
01:01:00.880 years right this whole Space is 10 years
01:01:02.160 it's a 10 year industry and I think
01:01:04.520 there's an article last week that said
01:01:06.240 it is a $250 billion economy now what
01:01:09.640 people need to understand is that all
01:01:11.079 these numbers are meaningless nobody
01:01:12.640 cares what they should have conviction
01:01:15.240 of is that we are 1% of the way there in
01:01:18.760 the Creator economy this is as new as
01:01:21.760 AI so let's assume the size is 100 100
01:01:24.760 billion that's what the global size
01:01:26.599 people
01:01:27.599 say we'll assume India is lesser because
01:01:31.520 uh the rate per clicks how much money
01:01:33.720 you can make out of
01:01:35.160 views significantly lower right would
01:01:37.400 you say 1/5th 1110th of it's one0
01:01:40.559 exactly 110 I mean my YouTube ad Revenue
01:01:43.760 cpms would say even worse no CU so I
01:01:47.200 have because I have international
01:01:48.280 audience and I can segment based on
01:01:49.520 Country so if I get a th000 view $1,000
01:01:52.200 from American audience I get $100 from
01:01:54.920 audience can you break down the 10,000
01:01:56.599 CR thing what what what does it mean I
01:01:59.359 would say see I know a little bit about
01:02:02.039 the influencer marketing world I have a
01:02:04.760 company called kluener I've invested
01:02:07.039 in I think the amount of money brands
01:02:10.400 are spending on Purely social media
01:02:13.920 influencers because you can extrapolate
01:02:16.240 and everybody's an influencer right if
01:02:18.520 your profession is social media
01:02:20.000 influencer like you for example I would
01:02:23.000 assume that number is between ,500 2,000
01:02:25.960 crores a year and growing by 30 40%
01:02:30.799 2,000 crores so effectively you're
01:02:32.799 saying that 2,000 crores is the
01:02:35.760 advertising pool for influencers yeah
01:02:38.799 that's how much money I'm a T-shirt
01:02:40.880 maker I give tme that much I give tme 50
01:02:43.359 lakhs to promote my t-shirt I'm talking
01:02:45.400 about things like that purely I'm not
01:02:47.520 talking about that's 10% of the economy
01:02:49.359 yeah that's there another a 90% which is
01:02:51.680 community Commerce creators making money
01:02:53.920 from their followers that's even smaller
01:02:56.480 without needing a well I think it's
01:02:58.039 going to get much bigger than Brands but
01:02:59.559 today I don't think it's very big but
01:03:02.319 but there's but in India maybe but there
01:03:04.440 actually because in India maybe the
01:03:06.119 audience does not buy so you rely a lot
01:03:08.079 on brands that maybe that's a culture
01:03:09.200 here in India but in America you're
01:03:11.240 making much more money from your
01:03:12.880 community than you're making from a
01:03:15.520 brand everything that happens in America
01:03:18.119 always takes 5 years to get to India
01:03:19.799 this has been the one out golden lesson
01:03:22.079 I've learned in my content creation I
01:03:24.480 sell in this case give me a
01:03:26.870 [Music]
01:03:29.720 second okay give me 30 seconds continue
01:03:32.400 your thought it happens in every
01:03:33.799 industry um to a large degree but in
01:03:36.760 media I've noticed that this happens
01:03:39.480 very very heavily no no no this is
01:03:40.960 you're talking cultural Trends wise but
01:03:43.839 the simple fact is India is a DA Farm of
01:03:47.279 the world and when you're are a low aru
01:03:49.839 country for let me just explain that
01:03:52.559 what I mean by low what do da Farm yeah
01:03:54.520 diu means daily active user Farm of the
01:03:58.200 world what this means is that Netflix
01:04:00.240 will launch in India but Netflix makes
01:04:02.920 the most amount of money per subscriber
01:04:05.079 around the world but for their investors
01:04:08.160 they're like we have 20 million
01:04:09.440 customers 30 million customers from
01:04:11.440 India so that looks impressive on a
01:04:13.119 global earning call right um this is why
01:04:17.039 I think we're far away from a US market
01:04:19.559 and it's not just five years away
01:04:21.640 because the degree to which you can
01:04:22.760 monetize your audience is directly
01:04:25.039 related to how affluent your audience is
01:04:28.559 and India unfortunately is a low arpu
01:04:30.640 country we are a developing econom arpu
01:04:33.160 is revenue per user go so how much money
01:04:35.880 can you extract from per user this is
01:04:37.720 true across platforms true across
01:04:39.599 creators Facebook makes faceb Facebook
01:04:42.640 arpu in India is way lower just like
01:04:44.640 Snapchat just like Netflix all of that
01:04:46.960 so no India is not just 5 years away
01:04:49.240 it's when the whole economy prospers
01:04:50.920 enough no no no no no no no that is the
01:04:53.200 pessimistic View
01:04:54.760 the optimistic view the optimistic view
01:04:57.480 let's let's all be optimistic people
01:04:59.039 here want to become creators is that in
01:05:00.920 India people maybe are not used to
01:05:04.720 buying something on the Internet that is
01:05:06.599 digital but they are used to spending a
01:05:08.799 lot of money onl physical experiences
01:05:11.880 for example last Summit tomorrow 1,000
01:05:14.720 tickets sold $77 per ticket I just made
01:05:18.559 $77,000 from India audience purely India
01:05:21.240 audience right so there is yeah it
01:05:23.400 depends on what would spend that like
01:05:25.119 yes what's the product yeah India spends
01:05:27.480 very highly on physical experium
01:05:30.400 products I would say we spend very
01:05:31.839 highly on education what is hm uh
01:05:34.680 products that give you hope for a state
01:05:37.279 that you want to you want to be in so we
01:05:39.279 do we do I mean influencers make so much
01:05:42.720 money right uh Financial products will
01:05:45.319 make make a lot of money in India
01:05:47.240 products that either save you money uh
01:05:50.240 save you money or make you more money
01:05:51.640 will make a lot of money products that
01:05:53.160 save you time don't necessarily make
01:05:54.559 that much money yes which is why courses
01:05:57.039 at Tech courses will do really well in
01:05:59.000 India um products that give you higher
01:06:01.559 status because higher status leads to
01:06:03.440 higher meeting success those make a lot
01:06:05.160 more money an example cred uh cred for
01:06:09.160 example okay higher status is we spend a
01:06:11.440 lot of money on fancy weddings wedding
01:06:14.119 wear right that's a higher higher status
01:06:16.839 thing uh we are less likely to use like
01:06:19.200 we want discounts on our Uber rights
01:06:20.839 because we're not we don't care so much
01:06:23.079 about saving minutes um so India has a
01:06:26.520 lot of money it's just people think a
01:06:28.240 product that does well in America will
01:06:29.520 do well in India but actually it needs
01:06:31.559 to be Indian ified almost a different
01:06:33.520 product needs to be sold here y I mean
01:06:37.039 it's always been the compass I've
01:06:38.160 followed in terms of deciding what where
01:06:41.000 I want to take my content as well as the
01:06:43.279 next business moves because as content
01:06:46.160 creators we don't have reference points
01:06:47.680 in India like the reference point I'm
01:06:49.039 using as a content creator in India one
01:06:51.359 uh it used to be like like you like at
01:06:53.520 the start of my career now it's a little
01:06:55.359 bit of bamd because he's the original
01:06:58.119 influencer of this country interesting
01:07:00.680 uh like I mean he influen Baba to give
01:07:03.440 Nas cont have you heard of Baba yeah of
01:07:05.119 course you've heard of his brand patan
01:07:06.640 I'm like 20% Indian at this
01:07:08.440 point I know a lot of the
01:07:10.720 references
01:07:13.559 naar that I don't
01:07:15.839 understand yeah I mean pangali was merch
01:07:20.680 merch launch you you earn trust over a
01:07:24.240 very long period of time have you tried
01:07:26.079 selling merch uh for me my merch is
01:07:29.000 digital it's my meditation app called
01:07:30.599 level superm digital right so not
01:07:32.000 physical by the way actually projecta
01:07:33.839 when we met in Davos you were wearing a
01:07:35.920 sweater and the sweater was so
01:07:37.640 interesting that it she put in a picture
01:07:40.039 got so many likes that the sweater end
01:07:41.559 up selling out at this uh uh shop I
01:07:44.440 should have won my
01:07:46.720 March so there is money in merch in
01:07:49.240 India is there yeah not in merch
01:07:52.079 necessarily but not many people who have
01:07:54.359 started influencer Le brands have done
01:07:57.279 well yeah I would say the failure rate
01:07:59.520 is 80 90% yeah okay I'll tell you what I
01:08:02.720 learned off of this meditation
01:08:04.520 app this is going to be slightly long
01:08:06.480 answer okay um basically uh we got a
01:08:10.359 huge boost when the app launched uh and
01:08:13.880 then it started trailing off a little
01:08:15.279 bit long story short I figured that now
01:08:17.880 there's too much distribution built out
01:08:19.679 this is in
01:08:21.158 2021 um we we're doing content content
01:08:24.359 is going well we're getting growth but
01:08:26.040 it's time to create a product at this
01:08:28.040 point uh I always wanted to do something
01:08:31.679 in the health space uh eventually we we
01:08:35.560 created an app with both physical
01:08:37.439 fitness as well as what item as mental
01:08:39.839 Fitness uh which was a bunch of guided
01:08:41.960 meditations guided uh sleep stories Etc
01:08:46.040 uh always wanted to bootstrap it when we
01:08:48.120 launched we got a massive response
01:08:50.198 thanks to beer biceps distribution and
01:08:52.679 it gradually started declining a little
01:08:55.120 bit over time even if we um spoke about
01:08:59.158 it in every
01:09:00.319 episode what I decided to do at that
01:09:02.600 stage was we went from two episodes a
01:09:04.799 week to four episodes a week now for
01:09:07.359 some reason this hacked the YouTube
01:09:09.399 algorithm and my stuff started getting
01:09:12.600 shown not just to uh people who
01:09:15.359 subscribe to you yeah but way more I
01:09:17.960 don't know what happened short is that
01:09:19.520 is that still as relevant how many times
01:09:21.799 you post EXP itially takes up your
01:09:24.679 audience it depends on the content for I
01:09:27.158 think I also caught the podcast Trend in
01:09:28.799 the country so um instead of my uh
01:09:33.120 subscriber rate my monthly subscriber
01:09:35.359 rate should have just doubled but it I
01:09:37.399 think it went something like four times
01:09:38.719 it went vertically I would just want to
01:09:40.120 double click on this a little bit right
01:09:41.479 so some formats lend itself to higher
01:09:44.000 top of funnel right for example duu
01:09:46.479 raati right Dro effectively is a modern
01:09:50.158 day News Channel right
01:09:52.520 so new news dominate whatever is
01:09:55.159 dominating the news if think he's doing
01:09:57.120 so much he's doing so well because he's
01:09:59.640 taking like we discussed earlier anti
01:10:02.800 narrative I don't think it's the case
01:10:04.199 with
01:10:04.880 Dro people but now with d Dro is not
01:10:07.440 Extreme as much as just an explainer of
01:10:10.000 what he thinks is going on more like a
01:10:11.600 Vox yeah so it's similarly in ranvir's
01:10:13.800 case uh you know ranvir's guests bring
01:10:16.520 in newer audiences each time and R is
01:10:19.080 able to retain some of them who end up
01:10:20.719 subscribing they're like I want to see
01:10:21.880 more of r on my timeline cuz he use a
01:10:23.920 lot of popular guests so if I were new
01:10:26.679 if I were a 20-year-old boy starting
01:10:30.000 something out to build distribution how
01:10:32.760 often should I post what duration works
01:10:35.360 today what is the path of least
01:10:38.120 resistance to get distribution so I
01:10:40.640 think a lot of people in this CH table
01:10:42.920 make long videos including you and I
01:10:45.440 don't know who the hell is still
01:10:46.679 watching this video you must have a lot
01:10:48.280 of time on your on your life okay but
01:10:51.320 the only and the best way to get
01:10:53.719 distribution today is to make YouTube
01:10:56.000 shorts Instagram reals Facebook reels
01:10:58.600 that are 59 seconds exactly which is the
01:11:00.760 one minute guy and I think short content
01:11:04.440 gets you reach and after you get the
01:11:06.560 reach you should go deep by creating the
01:11:08.840 podcast but you shouldn't start by
01:11:11.320 creating a podcast because a you've had
01:11:14.239 Fame from other places that's why your
01:11:16.600 podcast works but if if there's a nobody
01:11:19.320 now starting a podcast unfortunately
01:11:21.960 that's going to kill their dreams also
01:11:23.960 social media changes extremely do you
01:11:26.000 guys agree with what he said social
01:11:27.600 media changes literally every six months
01:11:29.640 so but for the last year or so a good
01:11:31.880 beginning has been exactly what n said
01:11:34.400 you make short videos 1 minute 2 minute
01:11:36.760 3 minute to begin with it's easier to
01:11:38.760 get more to top of funnel through short
01:11:41.040 video I agree but the Holy Grail is long
01:11:43.159 form that's that's that's the Holy Grail
01:11:45.280 I want to ask PR actually PR has done
01:11:47.040 both like she's prolific at Short video
01:11:49.040 now but you began with with YouTube like
01:11:51.679 what do you think like cuz you've done
01:11:53.199 both and and you now do a lot of the
01:11:54.880 short video stuff I was actually forced
01:11:57.840 to go to short video when the lockdown
01:12:00.159 started because that is what everybody
01:12:01.880 was doing and that was I think the only
01:12:04.239 time as a Creator where I felt like I
01:12:06.880 didn't have an option because it had
01:12:08.560 reached a point where I felt like
01:12:09.960 nobody's watching it nobody has the
01:12:12.440 patience for it nobody wants to spend
01:12:14.239 any more time so that's how it started
01:12:16.040 and I did not expect to like it I was
01:12:19.120 very resistant to short form content I
01:12:22.360 was um I was very adamant almost
01:12:25.800 stubborn with saying you know what I
01:12:27.360 don't care if the whole world's going to
01:12:28.719 make short content I'm going to stick to
01:12:31.040 I remember talking to Neil when uh they
01:12:34.400 kind of took funding off YouTube
01:12:36.480 Originals I was so upset yeah but I was
01:12:39.840 like I was coming to you with pitches I
01:12:41.560 had things I've been working on I wanted
01:12:43.400 to pitch Originals to you and you've
01:12:44.920 taken funding off because you're pushing
01:12:46.400 shorts and that broke my heart but and I
01:12:49.920 started having fun with it because then
01:12:52.440 you kind of see
01:12:54.120 um it's nice to go from a point of
01:12:57.199 understanding that if I'm making a
01:12:58.440 20-minute video and my analytics tell me
01:13:01.159 that I lost a huge chunk of my audience
01:13:03.920 at 7 seconds and then going and watching
01:13:07.000 like a 20 second video and seeing that
01:13:08.400 oh my God there's that many replays and
01:13:10.159 shares happening so
01:13:12.400 it's uh it's
01:13:15.400 affirmative but like he said the holy
01:13:17.639 gra holy gra is long also with long form
01:13:20.040 you're truly building Community because
01:13:22.080 you're developing trust cuz they're
01:13:23.120 getting to know your heart and not just
01:13:25.239 your vision yes but but let me disagree
01:13:27.560 here a little bit it's this is like
01:13:29.920 trying to swim against the tide you must
01:13:32.800 ask yourself where is the tide going if
01:13:34.760 you swim against the tide you can do
01:13:36.199 this and you still in the same location
01:13:37.880 okay always go with the winds so what is
01:13:40.159 the wins it's basically what does the
01:13:42.239 sea level leaders at social media
01:13:44.400 platforms say you should read the
01:13:46.960 earnings report you should read the
01:13:48.840 quarterly calls of Facebook YouTube and
01:13:51.760 Instagram and from listening to the CEOs
01:13:54.679 of the social medias you can guess where
01:13:56.480 the ties are going to go because these
01:13:57.840 guys control the ties and tiers where
01:14:00.159 are they going according so seven years
01:14:01.719 ago I was following Mark Zuckerberg's
01:14:04.080 reports right I was following the
01:14:05.280 quarterly earnings Mark Zuckerberg seven
01:14:07.159 years ago said uh you know pictures are
01:14:09.639 great uh but you know I I see a future
01:14:12.280 where uh in the future where 90% of
01:14:14.199 Facebook is going to be video bam let's
01:14:16.520 go video let's go right so no pictures
01:14:19.679 not a single picture of Nas daily right
01:14:21.639 what I'm trying to say is the tide
01:14:24.120 makers and the fortune makers are
01:14:26.159 actually humans living in Silicon Valley
01:14:28.080 and in China listen to what they say and
01:14:30.920 then do exactly what they what are they
01:14:32.960 saying today so right now the Tik Tok
01:14:34.600 guy is saying shopping on Tik Tok is
01:14:37.000 gonna be big and live on Tik Tok is
01:14:39.320 going to be big so I would probably try
01:14:40.760 that the people at YouTube are saying
01:14:42.679 you know no more originals YouTube
01:14:44.199 shorts is going to be the future so I
01:14:45.600 would I would index on that Facebook or
01:14:47.880 Instagram is saying what are they saying
01:14:49.639 they didn't even say anything these days
01:14:50.920 Instagram is like meta War they're
01:14:52.639 saying meta War they say metaverse right
01:14:54.199 so I would keep my eyes open like if I
01:14:56.320 was starting a 7year career now I would
01:14:58.760 probably want to start as like AI
01:15:01.159 Creator or a metaverse Creator because
01:15:02.920 in six years you are going to be at the
01:15:04.960 right place at the right time is that a
01:15:06.239 lot more expensive to create content on
01:15:08.239 the metaverse right now I mean camera
01:15:11.480 it's yeah it's it's not expensive it's
01:15:13.080 just I think 99% of the people haven't
01:15:15.719 even bought Quest yet yeah they just
01:15:17.920 they haven't tested it out million
01:15:19.639 people in the world that can watch so
01:15:21.280 what what we're saying in summary is
01:15:23.400 shorts build distribution then do long
01:15:25.920 form I I want to add something
01:15:27.280 experiential here based on my experience
01:15:29.719 selling this meditation app okay we get
01:15:33.840 about 3 to 4 million views on any short
01:15:36.960 form video that I create which is
01:15:39.080 usually emotional it caters to the
01:15:40.880 mental health oriented audience to whom
01:15:43.400 my app is also catered to I'm trying to
01:15:45.320 hit the mark I reach that audience for
01:15:46.679 sure because those reals get insane
01:15:48.120 engagement okay I do podcasts like that
01:15:50.880 as well we always get more sales from
01:15:52.840 the podcast us wow like almost we get we
01:15:55.760 get almost no sales from Instagram yeah
01:15:57.520 I want to just double click on this Nik
01:15:59.040 cuz it's not it's not as it's not as
01:16:00.760 black in white is what n is saying while
01:16:02.440 I fundamentally agree with him um think
01:16:05.199 about how you're consuming short form
01:16:06.679 content right you are actually scrolling
01:16:09.280 and something comes across and you see
01:16:11.800 it and that counts as a view to that so
01:16:14.800 when ranir gets 4 million views on a sh
01:16:17.880 probably a million of them may be people
01:16:20.520 who actively subscribe to rir whereas
01:16:22.120 the rest of them are just going to
01:16:24.679 which is why Affinity to a Creator when
01:16:26.560 they watch you for 9 minutes straight or
01:16:28.840 10 minutes straight is a lot higher
01:16:30.560 which is why movement or click- through
01:16:32.239 ratio on links that you provide will be
01:16:33.880 a lot higher on long form so short video
01:16:36.000 is a great way to get to get traction to
01:16:38.920 get traction and I would bet on like
01:16:41.120 donon said this recently right and no
01:16:43.440 said this a bit before saying that you
01:16:45.199 don't want to kill your dreams by
01:16:46.239 attempting something so audacious by
01:16:47.719 swimming against the tide what you
01:16:49.199 really want is to start feeling
01:16:50.480 confident as a Creator early on in your
01:16:52.159 career which is why short form video is
01:16:54.440 is effective for you to start that is
01:16:56.760 why yes correct there's different phases
01:16:58.199 in your life one is you're a nobody
01:17:00.080 everybody starts at a nobody we were all
01:17:02.000 nobody's 10 years ago correct so when
01:17:04.320 you are nobody your number one goal is
01:17:06.159 to be discovered you get discovered
01:17:08.000 through shorts then your number one goal
01:17:10.360 is to build a community so you make
01:17:11.719 Longs then your number one goal is to
01:17:13.840 build a business so you build a
01:17:15.360 community build a business the number
01:17:16.719 one goal is to start feeling confident
01:17:18.480 that you can be a Creator like donon
01:17:20.080 said I said that you want to bet on a
01:17:21.960 guy who's confident
01:17:23.679 about himself then necessarily someone
01:17:25.239 who's more talented cuz you can be very
01:17:26.800 talented but be underc confident but
01:17:28.000 you're not going to be effective so as a
01:17:29.719 Creator I would I would push for try and
01:17:33.159 get that one video to pop so you feel
01:17:35.159 like you can do this because nothing is
01:17:37.280 the harsh truth is that this industry
01:17:39.120 especially when it comes to money is
01:17:40.400 heavily dependent on the views you're
01:17:41.560 generating be at long form or short form
01:17:43.520 just figure out how to get the views
01:17:44.960 first and foremost then you can like go
01:17:47.080 through the nooks and Granny's off I
01:17:48.719 also feel like when you start off you it
01:17:51.239 it takes some time as a new Creator to
01:17:53.880 grasp the idea that it's a very long
01:17:56.080 game yeah it's not something that's
01:17:58.360 going to start give you overnight V
01:18:00.719 virality and then your life's set and
01:18:02.400 you're going to have businesses and a
01:18:03.560 community and stuff like that so I feel
01:18:05.199 like if you're starting off why what
01:18:06.639 they're saying is important is because
01:18:08.280 for you personally it's extremely
01:18:09.960 important for you to feel like you have
01:18:11.960 it and you to keep going to reach a
01:18:13.920 point where you'll be able to make a
01:18:15.280 community people kind of talk about the
01:18:17.400 downsides of content creation they don't
01:18:19.040 know the true picture of it and in its
01:18:20.920 core it's a chef's job you're serving
01:18:22.679 food constantly and people will forget
01:18:25.199 you after like a month of you relasing
01:18:27.679 okay so just to summarize we first
01:18:29.639 learned that every 7even years typically
01:18:33.040 a Creator life changes and you have to
01:18:35.000 use that time to monetize build
01:18:36.679 something which is outside of
01:18:38.560 creation we spoke about short form is a
01:18:41.600 good way to build traction initially
01:18:44.280 before moving on to long form yeah
01:18:46.679 listen to what the CEO of Tik Tok
01:18:49.400 Facebook Twitter are saying 100% uh hear
01:18:53.000 their earning calls and try to figure
01:18:54.400 out where they might be going to
01:18:57.760 next now what does a what are the lwh
01:19:01.840 hanging fruits like he also said Nas
01:19:05.280 said at some point that these six
01:19:07.760 opportunities in a year where by taking
01:19:10.639 the contrarian opinion you could have a
01:19:13.560 hack to building distribution I'm not
01:19:15.480 suggesting anyone should do it but
01:19:17.520 that's one hack now I'm starting today
01:19:21.159 my name is nikil I'm 20 years old I want
01:19:23.480 to build a business selling uh t-shirts
01:19:27.400 in 2 years I don't want to go the
01:19:29.800 traditional route of Performance
01:19:31.280 Marketing cuz that skews up my numbers
01:19:33.520 and I'll never make money that way I
01:19:35.679 need to build distribution to sell merch
01:19:38.440 what kind of content do I start creating
01:19:40.280 today low hanging fruit yeah I I want to
01:19:42.480 go first here I think at the heart of
01:19:46.280 either long form or short form is viewer
01:19:49.400 retention at the heart of it even if
01:19:51.639 it's short form the the videos that
01:19:53.400 perform the best are ones which has
01:19:55.080 highest viewer attention right average
01:19:56.760 view duration on that sh has to be high
01:19:59.120 and if you notice every major trend on
01:20:01.360 Instagram every major filter every Trend
01:20:04.000 that comes around is basically hinging
01:20:06.440 on what happens what's the reveal at the
01:20:08.600 end right be it the thing on the top of
01:20:10.920 your head saying what movie star
01:20:12.920 are you it it goes around for a bit and
01:20:14.600 at the end of it you'll get the answer
01:20:16.520 why is it like that because it's trying
01:20:18.159 to get you to watch towards the end so
01:20:20.320 even with short form like stuff like
01:20:23.320 um three things to three things to uh
01:20:26.639 three things to keep an eye on when
01:20:28.719 you're making your wardrobe number three
01:20:30.639 number two number one a small hack for
01:20:32.960 example you people want to stick to
01:20:35.080 number one and that's how you get people
01:20:36.320 to watch till the end number one will
01:20:37.800 blow your mind that's how people begin
01:20:39.480 begin videos at the heart of it get
01:20:41.440 people to watch till the end that's
01:20:42.760 going to get more so so that that's the
01:20:44.600 format right the question you need to
01:20:46.080 ask yourself is when it comes to the
01:20:48.679 content what do I have access to that
01:20:51.960 nobody else the world has access to
01:20:54.560 that's the question what do I know
01:20:57.000 better than anybody around my friends
01:20:59.719 yes what do I know what what is my
01:21:01.679 unique access right so when what is that
01:21:03.440 answer for you so for me right I was
01:21:05.159 like okay um I'm a software engineer but
01:21:08.199 a lot of my friends have access to like
01:21:09.760 engineering actually what I have access
01:21:11.600 to is the world I have access to Kenya I
01:21:15.600 have access to Ethiopia because I have
01:21:16.880 money to travel I have a good passport I
01:21:18.760 have access to the world while a lot of
01:21:20.880 people in India or a lot of people in
01:21:22.360 Pakistan a lot of people in my hometown
01:21:23.800 country don't have access to the world
01:21:25.800 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:21:26.960 go show you Ethiopia and so my unique
01:21:30.199 value to you is it's not it's not my
01:21:32.000 beauty it's not my looks it's I'm going
01:21:33.600 to show you the world I'm going to make
01:21:35.320 you travel with me for free while you're
01:21:37.639 pooping in the bathroom and I'm showing
01:21:39.280 you Ethiopia for one minute so that's
01:21:41.560 access so question is what is access you
01:21:43.840 have access that nobody has access to
01:21:45.159 what makes you unique what makes you un
01:21:46.760 is a comedic sense comedic sense so I
01:21:48.960 you know how to make people laugh so I
01:21:50.560 take that to any genre that I that I go
01:21:52.320 to naturally another thing I just want
01:21:55.120 to add to what n said while what you
01:21:58.679 have Andrew hubman is a great example he
01:22:00.360 has access to neurological data from dat
01:22:03.719 yeah so he's able to he's able to talk
01:22:05.199 about that you're special in that one
01:22:06.679 thing that everybody cares about the
01:22:08.320 second aspect is do people care about do
01:22:10.320 people care about be surprised that
01:22:12.400 everybody in the world cares about what
01:22:13.840 J access to even t-shirt manufacturing
01:22:16.199 you could get millions of views if you
01:22:18.040 make a good piece of content on how a
01:22:19.880 t-shirt is made you can but as a
01:22:23.159 long-term plan it's what you have access
01:22:25.320 to and what the world cares about that's
01:22:27.040 your marage that's the marriage and the
01:22:29.679 second thing I want to add there is like
01:22:32.199 this is great what n said is true but
01:22:35.719 how you make your and how scalable
01:22:38.360 it is determines how tired you get over
01:22:40.560 over a 10-e timeline right uh so in my
01:22:43.639 case I'm lucky that I'm able to make
01:22:46.120 humor out of anything so I'm able to
01:22:48.440 jump genres and be I'm able to scale a
01:22:51.000 lot more lot more easily where it's hard
01:22:52.679 scale when you're traveling that's why I
01:22:54.280 stopped after seven years cuz you can't
01:22:56.159 travel to Ethiopia anymore I'm dumb
01:22:58.120 tired you know and I can't keep watching
01:23:00.679 Ethiopia while I'm pooping what do you
01:23:02.920 have access to I think for me and it
01:23:05.760 took me some time to realize that
01:23:07.520 because like when I said when I started
01:23:09.520 making content I didn't make it with any
01:23:11.280 sort of plan it wasn't conscious I
01:23:13.080 didn't know what I was doing it took me
01:23:14.440 a very long time to figure out what my
01:23:17.280 place as a Creator was I was uh very
01:23:21.159 very inspired by what Lily was was doing
01:23:22.880 at that time so that was again a route
01:23:26.679 that was set for a female content
01:23:29.120 creator starting off in comedy doing
01:23:31.679 what a was doing was a route that was
01:23:33.760 set I understood that oh I can make like
01:23:35.880 songs and I can make sketches and stuff
01:23:37.920 like that so a lot of it and is why I
01:23:40.639 said in the beginning is it was so
01:23:42.239 important for our creator Creator
01:23:43.719 journey to have a player like aibb ahead
01:23:46.199 of us was because a lot of it was really
01:23:48.800 just adapting as I kept going because I
01:23:50.960 was just winging it for a very very long
01:23:53.280 time I was making up as I was going
01:23:55.320 if you asked me where do I see myself
01:23:57.600 like if you asked me 5 years ago where I
01:23:58.920 saw myself I I had no clue uh I didn't
01:24:01.960 also expect the economy to be what it is
01:24:04.239 like that and today what do you have
01:24:05.320 access to I think right now I've come to
01:24:07.840 realize that what I have access to is
01:24:09.560 that I can tell really mundane stories
01:24:11.440 and make it interesting how through
01:24:14.199 sketches through the storytelling that
01:24:16.320 I'm doing right now through uh even if
01:24:19.199 it's a story of me working out it's m
01:24:21.639 would you put is in the depiction
01:24:25.040 category if you're able to depict
01:24:26.760 something in artistic manner that's a
01:24:28.520 USB for yeah I think storytelling for me
01:24:30.840 commentary on society and what what
01:24:33.679 makes you work because that's not really
01:24:36.560 access in a manner right why is she has
01:24:39.080 access of just talent to perform in
01:24:41.800 multiple ways she can act she can dance
01:24:44.920 I and for the person watching this you
01:24:47.360 can tell if you have access to that or
01:24:48.679 not based on how entertained you keep
01:24:50.159 your five friends I'm assuming before
01:24:52.960 this but I only have five so you got
01:24:54.520 that right but I'm assuming before you
01:24:56.560 started content you were like the life
01:24:58.280 of your five friends right so that is
01:25:00.320 your first signal that there's something
01:25:01.719 there like when I started Facebook as a
01:25:03.560 as a normal person my Facebook status
01:25:05.760 update was getting 60 likes and my
01:25:07.760 roommate's Facebook status update was
01:25:09.520 was getting six likes I was like okay
01:25:11.520 yeah if I am 10 times better than my
01:25:13.880 roommate at telling a story there's
01:25:16.520 something there so if somebody's
01:25:18.199 watching this and they're the life of
01:25:19.480 the party of their friends you can have
01:25:21.960 10 follow and I also feel like it it
01:25:25.119 gets very confusing when you start off
01:25:26.800 because it's a very singular Journey uh
01:25:29.400 when you start off you are kind of
01:25:30.960 figuring everything out for yourself in
01:25:33.119 a way that also 8 years ago nobody knew
01:25:37.400 where this was going unless I'm sh my
01:25:39.679 you that short video I had not video but
01:25:42.760 like I I just in my head I just feel
01:25:44.520 like you just knew more than I knew uh
01:25:47.360 back when I started and because you were
01:25:49.719 doing that already but I just feel like
01:25:51.560 it is it is such a it can get very
01:26:00.080 um isolating it can get very very
01:26:02.480 isolating for you so even if you don't
01:26:05.800 exactly
01:26:07.520 know how to pinpoint what you have
01:26:10.520 access to I still feel like it's still
01:26:13.199 not a bad point to start yeah it's I
01:26:15.920 universally agree with the thought that
01:26:17.679 everyone must try creating online yeah
01:26:20.560 and that gets me to my next point which
01:26:21.920 is we used to live in a world before
01:26:24.480 this is I think Gary ve said this before
01:26:26.159 where it's like you're either a doctor
01:26:28.280 or a lawyer choose 20 years ago choose
01:26:31.280 you're a teacher a doctor or a lawyer I
01:26:33.360 said either yeah today we live in the
01:26:36.400 and economy right this not my idea to be
01:26:39.239 clear and you today you can be a doctor
01:26:42.760 and a teacher yeah you can be a lawyer
01:26:45.520 and a Creator and actually Creator is
01:26:47.679 the most and job in the world you can
01:26:50.520 literally be teacher waiter seen this
01:26:53.040 play out a lot of value to your other
01:26:55.239 Prof so now we saying not just
01:26:57.400 entrepreneurs but even
01:27:00.280 professionals it's a way for doctors
01:27:02.560 Engineers everybody to find clients
01:27:05.119 right from the GU scooping out ice cream
01:27:06.840 at Baskin Robbins
01:27:09.600 totally already happening future
01:27:11.960 president yeah I what what is your
01:27:14.000 unique access today I mean we start off
01:27:16.400 with health right like he he had access
01:27:18.760 like interesting humans uh I've had like
01:27:21.480 seven real inventions over an 8-year
01:27:23.679 career uh so I don't have an exact
01:27:26.040 answer but according to me uh one is the
01:27:28.960 size of my country's population that's
01:27:30.600 one unique thing I have what how do you
01:27:33.320 have access to
01:27:34.440 that I can talk in Hindi you
01:27:37.110 [Laughter]
01:27:40.040 can't you'll see
01:27:42.400 my I don't
01:27:50.639 ethiop uh there's a very different pulse
01:27:53.440 in India like of the Indian audiences so
01:27:55.800 content for them is very different as
01:27:57.320 compared to content for English audience
01:27:59.239 and I owe it to this human here who
01:28:01.360 suggested that I begin in the content
01:28:02.760 first place that's one uh the second is
01:28:05.040 I think you as a content creator you
01:28:07.199 have to see your own Human Side also
01:28:08.560 what are you good at as a human being uh
01:28:11.000 I'm an energetic person so I think
01:28:12.400 stamina and that's just helped because I
01:28:14.400 truly believe in content it's about
01:28:16.119 quantity over quality after a point so
01:28:19.080 you figure out how to up your quality oh
01:28:21.000 really yeah after quantity over quality
01:28:23.199 for interesting always okay that's a
01:28:25.679 great tip so whenever you begin even if
01:28:27.679 you're doing one every 6 months quality
01:28:29.960 hits no no when you begin it's only
01:28:32.520 quantity game he's saying quality first
01:28:34.840 then quantity you say quality first I
01:28:37.119 learn something at least see I'm I'm
01:28:38.560 talking based on my own trajectory I
01:28:40.159 learned how to create videos you got to
01:28:41.840 have some quality no zero quality you
01:28:43.719 should have zero quality at the
01:28:44.880 beginning have you seen day one Nas it's
01:28:47.320 horrible it's I think that's how all of
01:28:49.480 us feel about all our content but just
01:28:51.840 the the ability to frame to to double
01:28:54.360 click on that the more quantity you
01:28:56.400 output the better your quality gets if
01:28:58.159 you're really paying attention so qualty
01:29:00.679 the third like strong thing that's
01:29:01.920 worked for me honestly it's a bit of a
01:29:03.360 clich answer but engineering College
01:29:05.520 because it just taught me how to think
01:29:07.360 of the world as machines it taught me
01:29:10.040 how to break derse engineer things and
01:29:11.639 now I can learn anything faster than
01:29:13.639 normal but now the reason I follow you
01:29:15.960 is because you have access to
01:29:17.000 interesting India's most interesting
01:29:18.600 humans and which the normal person
01:29:21.119 cannot get access for you today that's
01:29:22.960 for you for you today but actually
01:29:24.600 people should ask themselves whoever is
01:29:26.000 watching this ask yourself what kind of
01:29:28.040 weapon are you are you a machine gun or
01:29:30.199 are you a sniper sniper how do you know
01:29:32.480 wow I say the same thing a we are
01:29:35.320 brothers from another mother we've done
01:29:36.800 too many panels
01:29:39.560 brother a machine gun is somebody that
01:29:41.920 say if I want to kill the enemy we
01:29:43.119 should get a viral video I shoot 500
01:29:45.280 bullets and hopes something sticks and
01:29:47.000 hits the enemy okay another digression
01:29:48.880 here wait wait this is an important idea
01:29:51.320 a sniper
01:29:53.119 no well the sniper has one bullet and
01:29:55.880 gets a head shot so a sniper in this
01:29:57.920 case is somebody who goes and makes a
01:29:59.280 Netflix documentary Waits three years
01:30:01.520 puts it on Netflix becomes big Jewish
01:30:03.360 matchmaking or Indian matchmaking that's
01:30:05.320 sniper cretive is that a thing Jewish
01:30:06.760 matchmaking yeah that's thing that's a
01:30:08.480 sniper Creator whoever made that that's
01:30:09.880 a sniper one episode I'm famous around
01:30:12.119 the world a a a machine gun is a
01:30:14.320 thousand videos in a thousand days a
01:30:15.880 thousand skits a th000 podcasts we're
01:30:17.920 all machine guns a was sniper once a
01:30:20.320 month twice a month boom you
01:30:23.520 you come once once a week I'm I'm
01:30:25.159 machine gun now which is I'm outputting
01:30:26.719 9 10 videos a month okay so one
01:30:29.440 digression I wanted to ask you guys
01:30:32.520 psychology states that kids born after
01:30:36.239 the year 94 are very different from us
01:30:39.560 so they don't get driving licenses as
01:30:41.440 much people who are above the age of 18
01:30:44.199 and are applicable to get a license are
01:30:46.239 not applying as much they don't buy
01:30:48.360 homes as much they don't uh go on buying
01:30:52.199 homes as much no no they don't go on
01:30:54.199 dates as
01:30:55.440 often and they spend a lot of time on
01:30:58.560 their devices so if the new content
01:31:01.480 creators of today because the young
01:31:03.239 younger generation initially adopts
01:31:06.320 content that becomes cool if somebody is
01:31:09.560 starting in the content world today what
01:31:12.000 does he build to cater to this
01:31:13.920 generation this is a very coddled
01:31:16.320 generation right uh they're more about
01:31:20.239 rights less about contribution these are
01:31:23.320 people born in a post 911 world where
01:31:26.159 they grew up not knowing what was going
01:31:28.600 on uh they know about right post truth
01:31:31.239 world now yeah they they've had
01:31:32.719 anti-bullying in school they've been
01:31:35.239 they've not been allowed to go out and
01:31:36.800 play like you remember when we were kids
01:31:39.280 like your parents would tell you come
01:31:40.639 home by 9:00 p.m. right correct correct
01:31:42.400 like right now that doesn't happen
01:31:43.760 anymore right now the kids are Totally
01:31:46.960 Tracked uh they they have to tell their
01:31:49.560 parents what they're doing at every
01:31:50.960 point of time
01:31:52.280 so this will change the consumers of the
01:31:55.679 content that is getting created today
01:31:58.400 and the people who build from now on
01:32:01.440 have to bear this generation in I me
01:32:03.040 short video is a direct result of this
01:32:04.880 it's lower attention spans right is that
01:32:06.960 all I i' break that down a little
01:32:08.679 further the one uh human need that stays
01:32:11.560 constant is storytelling the second
01:32:13.159 human need that stays constant that's
01:32:14.520 not spoken about is feeling something
01:32:17.440 extremely emotional something that Peaks
01:32:19.080 your emotion a lot and emotion could
01:32:20.920 also be just laughing really hard on T's
01:32:23.199 reaction videos something that Peaks
01:32:24.760 your emotion heavily also this
01:32:26.520 generation like the new the younger
01:32:29.080 people that I have come across the ones
01:32:30.719 that work with me I've seen generally
01:32:33.920 have more problems dealing with
01:32:35.159 loneliness than people I aged did uh it
01:32:38.199 says that there is some kind of vacuum
01:32:40.480 there which I've seen gets filled with
01:32:42.280 emotional content and really raw content
01:32:44.119 which is also why I think podcasts are
01:32:45.360 taking off in the country people want
01:32:47.280 realism I there's a fantastic podcast
01:32:49.800 called untriggered it's something like
01:32:51.400 this but more like chill likei yeah more
01:32:55.080 genzi uh blowing up just consist
01:32:57.840 consistently catering to uh the lonely
01:33:01.080 Urban Indian because when people listen
01:33:03.000 to it they feel like hey I'm hanging out
01:33:04.080 with my friends but if these kids have a
01:33:05.840 lot more time on their devices I'm
01:33:07.719 saying they're not going out and playing
01:33:09.159 because they're on their devices so much
01:33:10.800 more strangely enough another data point
01:33:14.600 here is
01:33:16.040 there their necessity or how they
01:33:19.040 perceive work is 20% less than our
01:33:21.960 generation like when we were at that
01:33:23.639 their age we were thinking work work
01:33:25.679 work they prioritize healing a lot more
01:33:28.960 and they they are a lot more healing
01:33:32.040 from what from been injured yet by life
01:33:35.000 to be healed no but the thing is the
01:33:36.560 strange thing is when you tell someone
01:33:38.600 when you teach a kid that if tan says
01:33:41.360 something about me I can let it offend
01:33:44.040 me so much even though he's expressing
01:33:47.159 his point of view that I can have mental
01:33:49.440 trauma because of it and then I can be
01:33:51.199 depressed or one of a 100 different
01:33:53.400 things why me as an
01:33:55.360 example so I actually kind of have a
01:33:57.639 different opinion I actually don't think
01:34:00.239 today's young kids are like this like
01:34:02.320 hurt and emotion and all that stuff I
01:34:04.119 don't think that're actually I feel like
01:34:06.639 they're much stronger they get offended
01:34:08.280 a lot no I just think offended people
01:34:11.480 have a bigger voice I don't think the
01:34:13.239 number of offended people are actually
01:34:15.040 agree with that I feel like the
01:34:16.600 ecosystem has changed in such a manner
01:34:19.080 that people take offense not just to
01:34:22.760 what is said to them people take offense
01:34:25.760 to what is happening around them and it
01:34:28.520 affects them in a significantly more uh
01:34:32.520 significantly deeper manner than it did
01:34:34.840 my generation and people hold on to pain
01:34:36.360 a lot longer because they've been
01:34:38.360 thought and conditioned to believe this
01:34:40.800 generation that I'm talking about that a
01:34:43.480 it is right to get offended B it is good
01:34:46.600 to you know demand for your rights but
01:34:49.520 nobody has ever asked him that what what
01:34:51.560 is your contribution to anything for
01:34:54.639 which you're demanding the rights that
01:34:56.320 you expect you should have so I'm
01:34:57.719 looking at the glass I think half full
01:34:59.639 and I'm looking you're looking at like
01:35:00.840 right here I think that behavior
01:35:03.360 actually does affect change you think
01:35:05.800 naturally we're just going to have a
01:35:08.159 nice country no it comes from a lot of
01:35:10.520 hard like disagreements and and fights
01:35:13.119 but what are you disagreeing about
01:35:14.560 you're disagreeing about things
01:35:16.840 like I don't like this city I don't like
01:35:20.360 this I don't like that when people when
01:35:22.800 enough people come out and say I don't
01:35:24.199 like the traffic in Bangalore what's
01:35:26.719 going to happen that's going to create
01:35:27.600 some pressure on the city council to fix
01:35:30.040 traffic the question I'm also seeing you
01:35:32.119 have a point there but the the point I'm
01:35:33.880 trying to make is this person who is
01:35:35.520 complaining about the traffic in
01:35:37.320 Bangalore has become the kind of person
01:35:39.920 that you put him in any ecosystem will
01:35:42.440 spend a lot of time complaining because
01:35:44.199 the the path the part to likes has the
01:35:47.760 least resistance today than it did
01:35:50.159 earlier h earlier the path to like to
01:35:53.280 getting likes was through literally
01:35:55.600 getting a fancier job was to literally
01:35:57.320 do you would you would want likes in the
01:36:00.000 domains that were accessible to you now
01:36:04.040 just that in today's world you're able
01:36:06.199 to get quicker dopamine hits by saying x
01:36:09.560 y and Zed things as someone once said
01:36:11.760 saying you you get likes if you're
01:36:13.960 pretty witty or outrage the are these
01:36:16.679 are the three these are the three
01:36:17.840 quickest parts to like so I don't blame
01:36:20.760 the generation for for being that way
01:36:22.880 cuz that's the quickest part to like
01:36:24.520 also I feel like a lot of the young
01:36:26.600 people like he said right now because of
01:36:28.400 the loneliness that they are uh kind of
01:36:30.760 going through a lot more than we did are
01:36:32.920 looking for companionship in
01:36:36.199 causes uh like I remember a time and I
01:36:39.119 hate to say put it like that but I
01:36:40.440 remember a time where it was cool to
01:36:42.880 talk about depression now is that time
01:36:46.080 when it started it was cool to talk
01:36:48.639 about um uh bullying you know you know
01:36:51.480 there came a time where one person would
01:36:53.480 speak up about it and then everybody
01:36:55.119 would speak up about it and it became
01:36:56.679 the term started getting used so loosely
01:36:59.480 yeah uh that weed a point yeah like the
01:37:03.040 sensitivity from it kind of went away so
01:37:05.440 I feel like at this point a lot of our
01:37:06.920 young audiences are also looking for
01:37:08.920 these groups and these communities praka
01:37:11.679 that is my point I'm not seeing this
01:37:14.080 trend is a good thing or a bad thing I'm
01:37:17.239 seeing as a content creator beginning
01:37:19.239 today what is a hack to hit this market
01:37:22.440 so okay and get them to follow you we
01:37:24.480 have to make a distinction between
01:37:26.400 complaining about something and feeling
01:37:28.280 like a victim about something feeling
01:37:30.639 like a victim I agree with you no one
01:37:32.199 should feel like a victim I'm a victim
01:37:33.840 help me help me for example traffic in
01:37:35.560 Bangalore okay you can either say
01:37:37.639 because of the traffic in Bangalore my
01:37:39.440 mental health is is is is killing me and
01:37:41.599 then I cannot show up to work that's a
01:37:43.239 victim mentality right but you could
01:37:45.000 also be a change maker mentality and say
01:37:47.080 I don't like the traffic in Bangalore
01:37:48.719 because of this and this and this and
01:37:49.880 this I agree with you I'm I'm talking
01:37:51.599 about the victims so maybe we should
01:37:53.480 victim that's happening a lot now I'm
01:37:56.000 wondering because n there is there's
01:37:58.719 likes in victimhood
01:38:01.599 there's no no but the real question here
01:38:04.280 at the bottom of this is what content do
01:38:07.159 you build to hit this Market because we
01:38:09.920 know this Market is there but we
01:38:11.159 shouldn't make content to hit this
01:38:12.360 Market no but get them to resonate with
01:38:14.400 you people are people are outraging
01:38:17.000 outraging and being victim gets
01:38:19.040 likes a 2023 this answer would have been
01:38:22.159 different last in the year before that
01:38:24.239 uh right now the key to growth is
01:38:25.560 Instagram reals what's working on
01:38:26.800 Instagram reals is emotional content
01:38:28.639 what's working within emotional content
01:38:30.360 is well-made content so the bottom line
01:38:33.639 here is that the skill that should be
01:38:34.880 focused on now is how you can become a
01:38:37.239 better video content creator how can it
01:38:39.400 be better looking how can you tell a
01:38:41.239 story in a short amount of time and at
01:38:43.599 the end of your real do you leave
01:38:45.280 someone feeling like they want more from
01:38:47.400 you or from the St if you want to grow a
01:38:49.840 base on LinkedIn or Twitter you don't
01:38:51.119 don't need to necessarily make video but
01:38:52.760 if you're
01:38:54.080 outraging you think that's the way to
01:38:56.599 resonate with this Marketplace if I'm on
01:38:59.280 social media I'm seeing the best of
01:39:00.800 other people's lives would I not
01:39:02.920 automatically feel like I deserve that
01:39:04.679 too yes you would of course you would of
01:39:07.280 course you would let me give you an
01:39:08.520 interesting anecdote okay and I'm pretty
01:39:10.400 sure it will check out statistically the
01:39:13.040 ATT yeah I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure
01:39:14.960 of this like if someone does this the
01:39:17.320 attrition rate among talent management
01:39:19.360 companies is that its highest it's ever
01:39:21.320 been all right why is that you explain
01:39:24.440 what attrition rate I'll explain
01:39:25.679 attrition rate is when people leave a
01:39:27.040 company which is the employees churn now
01:39:30.040 you ask you ask vage from Monkey you ask
01:39:32.880 you ask Vijay from Collective why is
01:39:35.440 that because 20 years ago if I was
01:39:37.480 managing talent for example if I was
01:39:39.960 managing Aran right would there be that
01:39:42.679 much Envy for Aran as a manager I'd look
01:39:45.000 at Aran make 3 CR rupees per show I
01:39:47.360 would not have that much Envy but today
01:39:49.199 if I'm managing a Creator who makes
01:39:50.520 short video video or Mak sketches on
01:39:52.760 Instagram what and this person is taking
01:39:54.880 10 lakhs per real how high do you think
01:39:56.960 that Envy is it's insanely high right
01:39:59.400 that is why attrition is going going
01:40:00.800 higher and higher because more managers
01:40:02.320 are managing Talent who are doing things
01:40:04.159 that seem a lot more accessible and
01:40:06.040 doable how do you utilize that if you're
01:40:08.920 a content creator and you know the
01:40:10.599 generation you're creating for is a bit
01:40:13.560 more entitled is a bit more victimized
01:40:16.520 is a bit more all they are alluded by
01:40:18.920 flashy life we already do this why why
01:40:21.080 do flexing on the internet get more
01:40:22.719 likes yeah sales 101 you solve for their
01:40:25.080 problems which is this I I'll Define who
01:40:27.440 I want to solve the problem for I am a
01:40:30.599 20-year-old girl in Bangalore who is
01:40:35.840 going to college not really interested
01:40:37.920 in education that much but going because
01:40:40.159 my parents have drawn that path for me I
01:40:42.840 have 50,000 Rupees a month of income I'm
01:40:46.639 earning from some side thing that I'm
01:40:48.320 doing I have 20,000 rupees to spend I
01:40:51.239 have 4 hours a day to consume content I
01:40:53.719 spend 7 hours a day on my cell phone
01:40:56.080 doing
01:40:57.080 ABC this is a different category of
01:40:59.880 people than 5 10 15 20 years ago what
01:41:04.280 kind of content will resonate with this
01:41:06.639 crowd nuanced different from 10 years
01:41:09.960 ago I think every Creator will have a
01:41:11.960 different answer firstly I'll tell you
01:41:13.920 my answer yeah these problems are
01:41:16.199 happening with younger people because
01:41:17.639 there's overthinking you solve for their
01:41:19.280 overthinking how by talking about your
01:41:22.360 own story as a Creator this is also
01:41:24.520 personal branding that I was also at the
01:41:26.119 stage this is what I did and this is the
01:41:28.480 solution I had that's something that
01:41:30.119 works for me a lot the second thing that
01:41:31.719 I've noticed people want a lot I don't
01:41:33.480 know whether it's an Indian thing or not
01:41:34.760 nas please chip in uh people are
01:41:37.760 extremely hungry for knowledged and
01:41:40.280 unbiased media like raw media so you
01:41:43.159 throw a bomb of rawness through the
01:41:44.960 podcast and in terms of this
01:41:46.679 overthinking and these emotional
01:41:47.880 problems that's where I have my
01:41:49.679 Instagram game but is there only one
01:41:51.480 kind of content that they want to cons
01:41:53.040 no no there'll be a bunch of options I
01:41:54.639 want you guys to tell me what they this
01:41:56.520 girl so we're looking at this girl as a
01:41:58.960 glass not half empty empty we're looking
01:42:01.679 at this girl as somebody who wants to
01:42:03.000 feel entitled who wants to like be like
01:42:04.800 have a have a has terrible opinions this
01:42:07.239 girl actually what she really wants she
01:42:09.440 wants to travel to 50 countries around
01:42:11.040 the world before she's age 30 She Wants
01:42:12.920 To Be A Millionaire before she's 30 okay
01:42:14.639 she doesn't want to get forc AR go one
01:42:16.560 level deeper why does she want to travel
01:42:19.159 because it's a human B basic desire to
01:42:22.360 be free and experience the world is it
01:42:24.679 validation amongst her peer group a bit
01:42:27.159 more than it was 10 years ago no I think
01:42:30.199 I think it's a it's a basic human desire
01:42:31.960 I don't think it's validation I don't
01:42:33.400 think it's like I want to travel just to
01:42:34.639 tell my friends I traveled I think
01:42:35.679 that's a minority I think independently
01:42:38.000 everybody wants I think data would prove
01:42:40.040 otherwise that because of social media
01:42:41.920 and posting when you travel you travel
01:42:44.840 so much more like we going after the
01:42:46.280 Nuance now we saying what can you sell
01:42:48.800 to that girl very inde no no it's also
01:42:50.760 Wern thing
01:42:51.920 it's American I think in America living
01:42:55.360 in say Suburban whatever Mississippi I
01:42:58.520 refuse to believe people want to travel
01:43:00.239 just so they tell their friends travel
01:43:01.880 just but also because they can added
01:43:04.360 benefit but but people want to travel
01:43:05.920 just because they want to travel you
01:43:06.960 know I go to males sometimes it's very
01:43:09.360 close from Bangalore in our flight
01:43:11.920 Chinese couples come to males not to
01:43:14.719 check out males they come there to take
01:43:16.960 pictures of themselves because social
01:43:19.719 validation is such a big commodity in
01:43:22.520 China to the extent that who you marry
01:43:25.719 who you date what job you get all of
01:43:28.960 these kind of like are so correlated to
01:43:31.040 how much Social following why is this
01:43:32.679 new talk no it's not new because we've
01:43:34.760 been socially validating to each other
01:43:36.239 since we were tribal since we had a
01:43:37.960 tribe and people put different makeup
01:43:39.679 I'm saying it's new what I'm saying it's
01:43:41.280 the same I'm saying this category Beyond
01:43:43.679 94 95 these kids are different in this
01:43:47.960 nuanced manner does the content created
01:43:50.880 for them have to change have to look
01:43:52.840 look different my answer is definitely
01:43:55.040 not I there's nothing different between
01:43:57.239 somebody born after 94 or somebody born
01:43:59.800 in 1794 we all want social validation we
01:44:03.320 all want a signal to others that we're
01:44:04.800 good that we're pretty that we're
01:44:05.880 whatever even tribes in Papa New Guinea
01:44:08.880 okay there's always that guy who's like
01:44:11.159 best dressed has a feather look at me
01:44:13.400 look at me look at me now you can say
01:44:15.800 Look At Me by having a nice picture in
01:44:17.360 the Maldives it's easier to say look at
01:44:19.560 me but the fundamental of humans have
01:44:21.920 not changed in 1994 you know just adding
01:44:23.960 on to what he said and going back to the
01:44:25.480 content bit I remember when we were
01:44:27.400 shooting when mismatch came came to us
01:44:29.960 and we started reading the text uh the
01:44:32.080 scripts of mismatch we were shooting it
01:44:34.000 muscan who's uh one of the actors on
01:44:35.880 mismatch with me we used to keep
01:44:37.159 discussing how this is so similar to the
01:44:39.280 content we watched when I was a teenager
01:44:42.040 like we watched shararat and we watched
01:44:44.280 D mil these are these were amazing
01:44:47.960 shows uh we watched Sanji
01:44:51.520 uh
01:44:53.800 yeah uh what was the one that had sha in
01:44:56.800 it um all of them
01:45:00.400 yeah so and we realize that the content
01:45:03.320 that is getting made in 2019 came out on
01:45:05.679 Netflix on in 2020 was so similar to
01:45:09.599 what I was watching when I was 12 and 13
01:45:12.239 right and that came from a whole kind of
01:45:16.520 um
01:45:17.960 um peak of all the crimes dramas all the
01:45:21.239 True Crime all um slightly darker grayer
01:45:25.000 content so when you speak when you speak
01:45:26.760 about all this that maybe has has the uh
01:45:30.080 Machinery changed or do we approach a
01:45:32.960 different angle when you're telling
01:45:34.239 these stories then I want to hear what
01:45:36.320 you guys have to say about this that how
01:45:38.119 come then a simple piece of content that
01:45:40.960 was very new at the time that it came
01:45:42.599 out because most of the content was very
01:45:44.679 unlike that
01:45:46.400 resonated with an audience that is post
01:45:49.480 94 but it was also something that
01:45:51.719 resonated with us when we were that age
01:45:54.320 I think
01:45:56.119 broadly first principles thinking when
01:45:58.520 it comes to content creation broadly I
01:46:00.199 agree with n that yes broadly I agree
01:46:03.280 that yeah fundamentally brains haven't
01:46:05.480 changed brains and the chemical
01:46:07.320 reactions in the brain when you when you
01:46:08.880 perceive something that hasn't thousand
01:46:10.880 of that hasn't changed do you think woke
01:46:12.719 dat woke content will work more today
01:46:14.760 than it but I was just getting to the
01:46:16.199 nuances some of the nuances you should
01:46:18.159 you should keep in mind is that the
01:46:21.080 things that a hyperconnected world that
01:46:24.840 the big difference between 794 and now
01:46:27.000 is that we are hyperconnected right so
01:46:29.159 content uh moves a lot faster so know
01:46:31.520 that we're in a PO post truuth world
01:46:34.080 right we're not in a world where
01:46:35.800 anything gets verified we always we in a
01:46:38.360 post truth world so this this is the
01:46:40.000 Nuance from today which is that
01:46:41.719 gets boring a lot quicker yeah yes right
01:46:44.280 as opposed to 1794 correct uh tricks get
01:46:47.000 older a lot quicker now as opposed to
01:46:48.760 1794 correct the this that's the kind of
01:46:51.199 nuance I was trying to look at which is
01:46:53.119 you got to reinvent reinvent a lot more
01:46:55.560  gets boring a lot quicker yeah but
01:46:57.440 it's not a sexy answer that nikel was
01:46:59.080 looking for is there a is there a sexy
01:47:00.840 answer like I want to tell the
01:47:02.599 20-year-old girl what to go and create
01:47:05.800 which will do better than 100 years
01:47:07.920 ago okay like should we brainstorm on
01:47:10.520 different categories like I'm assuming
01:47:12.400 what is Define her access like what
01:47:14.199 makes her unique yeah exactly nothing
01:47:17.360 unique more generic like fashion say
01:47:21.080 she's
01:47:22.080 a she's ma very specifically India
01:47:25.560 focused she's studying bcom in a tier 2
01:47:30.080 College in Bangalore let's say pocket
01:47:32.480 money is not 50,000 let's say it's
01:47:34.320 10,000 rupes doesn't matter yeah but
01:47:37.040 what is what are her interests She Likes
01:47:39.520 music
01:47:41.719 Bollywood uh Stock Investing and content
01:47:45.719 creators all right so off the top of my
01:47:47.480 head Bollywood she could review movies
01:47:49.679 yeah is that an opportunity because
01:47:51.920 there are there are so many people
01:47:53.560 already reviewing movies yeah what's
01:47:55.440 what's the manner in which they're
01:47:56.440 reviewing movies a format idea is you
01:47:58.639 could review movies either straight like
01:48:00.280 hey this is what I thought of the movie
01:48:01.599 or you review movies in a format like I
01:48:03.199 would do a format like things I thought
01:48:05.040 of while watching Rocky or Rani that's
01:48:07.199 my format that's how I do movie reviews
01:48:09.679 I just tell you the thoughts in my head
01:48:11.000 so it's just a series of jump Cuts Like
01:48:12.800 I thought this this this this this this
01:48:14.520 this this or she can do something that's
01:48:15.880 unique to her Stock Investing for women
01:48:18.199 that are broke that's
01:48:20.800 St investing for women that are broke or
01:48:22.520 just simplifying communication around
01:48:23.960 stocks we weren't taught that tell me
01:48:25.719 how to do my taxes the sexy answer for
01:48:28.560 me is New Age journalism start talking
01:48:30.920 about world events it's very risky to
01:48:32.199 get you canceled a lot but if you and
01:48:33.679 you what are you
01:48:35.360 saying New Age new I'm not like taking
01:48:37.800 away nothing from journalism degrees I
01:48:39.000 think you need to be trained to be a
01:48:40.560 journalist etc etc but um dude I don't
01:48:44.360 care it's where the world is going no
01:48:45.719 actually resonate with him I feel like
01:48:48.360 journalism inherently as has a idea
01:48:50.960 sitting behind a corporation does not
01:48:52.719 work because every corporation has bias
01:48:56.199 it has to eventually become more
01:48:57.760 fragmented every journalist that wants
01:48:59.840 to survive as a journalist has to go
01:49:01.199 independent in the next 10 years I agree
01:49:03.639 with you I feel like especially when
01:49:05.360 you're starting off and I I I agree to
01:49:07.199 what you're saying but I feel like it'll
01:49:08.320 take a 20-year-old Creator who's
01:49:10.239 starting off a really long time to reach
01:49:12.960 there to a also have the guts to put it
01:49:14.840 out like that it's not easy to put
01:49:17.679 yourself out there because it's ruthless
01:49:21.040 and why do we forget that at the end of
01:49:22.800 the day it is a job it's much more
01:49:24.920 ruthless for women than men yeah and you
01:49:26.800 have to turn your laptop off and you
01:49:28.800 have to have a life where you are not
01:49:30.960 messed up in your head because something
01:49:32.520 is what he said is it a lot more
01:49:34.119 ruthless for women uh I'm always the
01:49:37.440 wrong person uh to answer this and I'll
01:49:40.360 get to that in just a minute but like
01:49:41.599 finishing what I was saying so I feel
01:49:43.440 like for for anyone new actually woman
01:49:45.599 or man start start or any other gender
01:49:47.679 starting off uh right now I feel like
01:49:50.119 it's important and it goes back to what
01:49:52.040 we said a while ago it's important for
01:49:53.560 you to G get that confidence and
01:49:55.480 validation and credit for yourself to
01:49:57.880 kind of keep going because it's a much
01:49:59.800 longer Journey so I feel like if she had
01:50:01.400 to start to reach what you are saying
01:50:03.760 she will have to do something as basic
01:50:05.639 as report things as is and then start
01:50:08.679 pushing out opinions then start giving
01:50:11.400 um perspective then start sharing
01:50:13.239 personal stories see what the community
01:50:15.520 is saying but would she get traction if
01:50:17.320 she reports things as is so many
01:50:19.719 channels are there are so many channels
01:50:22.480 right now that are only doing YouTube
01:50:23.800 news yeah reports things as is as in in
01:50:26.239 the most boring way possible no in the
01:50:28.199 not in the most boring way obviously so
01:50:30.360 the new comes in but things as they are
01:50:32.520 like truth is often very boring but with
01:50:34.960 a different format with a bit more
01:50:35.960 energy what if she does it what she jump
01:50:38.040 Cy and if it's it's not the kinds that
01:50:40.520 she's sitting in front of a green screen
01:50:41.880 and reading out of a folder but she is
01:50:44.280 say it is a vlog where every hour of the
01:50:48.360 day suppose she Vlogs for 10 10 hours a
01:50:50.560 day and every hour of the day she gives
01:50:51.760 you a fun fact this is Vlogs is the
01:50:53.760 answer also really yeah is not the
01:50:56.719 answer I know Vlogs had become really
01:50:58.560 big a few years ago right and then it
01:51:01.440 disappeared least friction for likes
01:51:04.599 vlogging vlogging yeah in India for sure
01:51:07.360 like but your life has to be interesting
01:51:09.440 making a vlog is much harder you've not
01:51:11.400 seen Indian Vlogs and it has to stay
01:51:13.119 interesting every day okay for people
01:51:16.119 who don't know what is the Vlog it's a
01:51:18.599 video log
01:51:20.920 it's basically filming your life from
01:51:22.239 when you wake up until when you sleep
01:51:23.840 it's a 10 to 20 minute long video and it
01:51:26.360 basically means you have your camera
01:51:27.679 with you the whole godamn time it's life
01:51:30.719 so the thing is vlogging can either be
01:51:32.960 higher for vlogging or it could just be
01:51:34.599 documenting your life it is the like
01:51:37.320 it's a it's it's the quickest way of
01:51:39.239 outputting something which is you just
01:51:40.320 document everything that's happening so
01:51:41.440 there are lots of incredibly boring
01:51:42.880 blogs and there are folks who make it
01:51:45.199 interesting as well um second question
01:51:48.320 give a good example Indian blogs Indian
01:51:50.560 Vlogs of what like anything who's doing
01:51:54.119 well yeah so India's biggest vlogger is
01:51:56.400 this guy called Sor Joi uh super
01:51:59.239 interesting right like he lives with his
01:52:01.400 family in a small town called Hali um he
01:52:04.679 lives with his mom dad his younger
01:52:06.239 brother some extended family extremely
01:52:08.280 relatable like he puts out a video every
01:52:10.280 day that does that clocks like 5 to 7
01:52:12.280 million views every single day so for me
01:52:14.639 as a viewer what's working there just
01:52:17.800 pure relatability he's just like
01:52:19.880 millions and millions of other families
01:52:22.239 in this country so people love is that
01:52:24.440 what's working for anit yes yes yes also
01:52:28.639 anid is also like a mission driven
01:52:30.400 Creator Mission driven Creator is also
01:52:31.920 very aspirational like so if I were
01:52:34.440 again a 20-year-old boy instead of a
01:52:36.239 girl and I want to start on the Journey
01:52:38.880 of logging to build distribution yeah
01:52:42.000 what kind of life should I project what
01:52:43.440 will work uh not only life but I think
01:52:45.920 the quickest way to get a former
01:52:47.960 Community is to find a mission like if
01:52:49.800 if you were starting um saying I'm going
01:52:52.280 to get sixpack abs 75 hard 75 hard like
01:52:55.560 I'm I'm going to get this in the next in
01:52:57.800 the next X number of days the viewer
01:53:00.040 automatically roots that you you get it
01:53:01.920 so is that going back to your earlier
01:53:03.840 point where you have to have a reveal at
01:53:05.800 the end that it helps when people want
01:53:08.360 to find find out what's the end of the
01:53:10.159 story if there's an end goal uh people
01:53:12.599 want to watch it till the end right Pro
01:53:14.520 if you had to start a blog that would
01:53:18.760 work I would I would do that uh working
01:53:21.880 out for 100 days and I Vlog my workout
01:53:24.560 Journey every single day like there's a
01:53:25.840 really popular YouTuber called Ryan Tran
01:53:27.800 right who became massive he started a
01:53:30.400 series called traveling across America
01:53:32.159 using one penny right correct me if I'm
01:53:34.119 wrong traveling across you 30 days in 30
01:53:36.159 days traveling across America using one
01:53:37.800 penny so every episode he would begin
01:53:39.480 with one penny and be like I'm going to
01:53:40.719 go from 8. A to B it makes the episode
01:53:43.840 automatically that much more why go far
01:53:45.320 I mean n daily that's how it was it was
01:53:46.639 a thousand day Journey around the world
01:53:48.800 so you start to see I started to see
01:53:50.639 that the numbers of likes and Views
01:53:52.199 started to go up in the last 20 days
01:53:54.280 because people are like oh how is he
01:53:55.440 going to end his thousand day journey is
01:53:57.079 he going to break a day and what's going
01:53:58.599 to happen on day 1000 on day 1000 I got
01:54:00.719 the most number of likes I ever got so
01:54:02.880 that's the reveal 75 hard 75th day most
01:54:05.639 number of views now he's a lot more than
01:54:07.239 75 now he's a lot more now he's just
01:54:08.920 continuing you do a lot of stuff around
01:54:11.599 ran does a lot of spirituality uh
01:54:15.360 religion uh you know the whole UFO uh my
01:54:20.480 and all of that is there a big audience
01:54:22.560 for that is that a hack um there is a
01:54:25.920 big audience for that because it
01:54:27.760 interests a lot of people it genuinely
01:54:29.599 interested me since I was a kid and I
01:54:31.599 get to explore these subjects as an
01:54:33.000 adult so I think the genuinity of it is
01:54:34.960 what that massive Tam connects with the
01:54:37.239 one thing life has taught me is never
01:54:38.679  on anything because nobody knows
01:54:41.440 what you don't know so I don't want to
01:54:45.040 like comment about it from that lens but
01:54:48.159 if I were a
01:54:50.320 uh Creator who wants to build Traction
01:54:52.920 in that segment what should I really
01:54:55.040 talk about the truth is that at least
01:54:57.560 what I sense in India is that that phase
01:54:59.880 has gone now yeah yeah religion not
01:55:03.280 religion religion will never go the
01:55:04.800 other stuff you mentioned alien yeah
01:55:07.400 people want depth in content now but
01:55:09.760 there can be depth there too right so if
01:55:11.040 you can bring depth great but there
01:55:12.159 aren't enough people to talk about it
01:55:13.599 now so what what does ran think today
01:55:17.119 will work in the next one year the next
01:55:19.440 one year because years elections are
01:55:21.520 coming up so political content young
01:55:23.199 people are getting into politics uh
01:55:25.199 older people don't have the balls to
01:55:26.400 speak about politics nowadays so if some
01:55:29.400 kid speaks about politics it'll actually
01:55:31.320 Garner a lot of attention and what else
01:55:34.159 that's one massive one geop extres
01:55:36.440 extremes get views yeah geopolitics is
01:55:39.079 the other one same and when you're
01:55:40.719 talking about politics Will the anti
01:55:43.960 view get a lot more traction I think at
01:55:46.719 this point it's about depth uh think
01:55:48.840 school great example
01:55:50.360 deep content that's selling you can't do
01:55:52.520 surface level content at least I'm
01:55:53.960 speaking from a very India perspective
01:55:55.760 but I think this is the case from
01:55:57.239 International uh uh you know in
01:55:59.840 international vs as well we see that
01:56:01.159 with Andrew huberman we see that with
01:56:02.920 even Andrew Schulz and all these guys
01:56:04.280 they go deep with their conversations so
01:56:06.320 now is that point where Joe Rogan was in
01:56:09.800 2018 where he started doing three-hour
01:56:11.520 podcasts and people are willing to
01:56:13.159 listen to it so if you bring depth to
01:56:14.800 your content what worked for Jo Rogan
01:56:17.000 quantity you think yes I've been
01:56:19.639 listening to Jo Rogan since I was in
01:56:21.480 college which is 2011 or 2012 and he
01:56:24.119 used to get 30,000 views and I've seen
01:56:25.480 him going from there to this $100
01:56:27.000 million Spotify contract before I began
01:56:30.320 content creation it was a dream of mine
01:56:32.199 to have a podcast but I always thought
01:56:33.360 dude India either will never be ready
01:56:35.159 for a podcast or it's not ready for
01:56:37.560 podcast yet and I started my cuz we
01:56:41.320 were doing two channels work was getting
01:56:42.840 too much for me I wanted to switch off
01:56:44.040 one channel team said listen what's the
01:56:45.840 easiest form of content you can do I
01:56:47.719 said I'll talk to people and turn that
01:56:49.239 into content and then we just hit a wave
01:56:52.320 okay next question how big of a hack is
01:56:55.679 making content in Regional languages big
01:56:59.119 hack big huge hack huge hack huge I give
01:57:03.000 I give you a stat Nas daily has 65
01:57:05.719 million followers 30 million of our
01:57:08.000 followers don't speak English they
01:57:09.760 cannot speak English we have 2 million
01:57:12.239 followers in Vietnam that's 2% of the
01:57:14.440 country and I don't speak a single word
01:57:16.639 of Vietnamese 14% of Russia
01:57:20.159 watch his nce daily every month on
01:57:21.480 YouTube the kids mainly why is because
01:57:25.000 take the same content that we done in
01:57:27.040 English and we localize it to 13 other
01:57:29.520 languages you using AI or like uh we did
01:57:32.520 subtitles we did the beginning we did
01:57:34.079 subtitles and now we do dubbing which we
01:57:35.880 pay $100 per minute and now we're using
01:57:38.199 AI but all of that has has unlocked a
01:57:41.320 massive Market the question is why can
01:57:43.199 you can you also give some tools after
01:57:44.960 you say yeah why does Nas daily have two
01:57:48.079 million followers in Vietnam because the
01:57:50.199 demand for content in Vietnam is very
01:57:52.520 high you have 100 million people each
01:57:54.360 one of them has 10 hours every day they
01:57:55.840 want to watch videos but the people
01:57:57.840 making the videos in Vietnam are very
01:57:59.520 low there's only state media it's like
01:58:02.400 TV which is boring and a couple of
01:58:04.280 content creators and every Hollywood
01:58:06.599 movie doesn't actually make it to
01:58:07.719 Vietnam all this content you make does
01:58:09.639 not make it to Vietnam all this podcast
01:58:11.480 you make does not make it to Vietnam so
01:58:13.000 there's no supply of content when you
01:58:15.520 add this content in Vietnamese the
01:58:18.480 supply is so low you get so many views
01:58:21.719 that is called a hack like equilibrium
01:58:24.560 there's no equilibrium in content supply
01:58:26.280 and demand so in English there is an
01:58:28.239 equilibrium there's enough supply of
01:58:29.679 content there's enough demand for it you
01:58:31.040 mean in the middle yeah in Vietnamese
01:58:33.920 Supply is so low the demand is so high
01:58:36.679 it's true uh when you speak to people's
01:58:39.400 identity it generates it generates a
01:58:42.480 just a higher engagement rate right be
01:58:45.079 it in their native language or be it
01:58:47.320 about who they are for example if I if I
01:58:51.280 say you know 10 things only Engineers
01:58:53.400 will understand right you'll get a lot
01:58:55.239 more shares from Engineers 10 things
01:58:57.119 that only Vietnamese people will get
01:58:58.840 that's interesting go go deeper in that
01:59:01.079 if you speaking to someone's identity
01:59:04.079 just gets gets more like like BuzzFeed
01:59:06.960 pioneered this ages ago right BuzzFeed
01:59:09.320 did uh take this quiz if you're
01:59:11.480 overweight or 15 things that fat girls
01:59:13.639 will will relate to right like they
01:59:15.280 pioneered this and it became obvious
01:59:16.760 eventually that's why nationalistic
01:59:18.960 Contex does really well that's why
01:59:21.480 geopolitics does really well right cuz
01:59:24.400 geopolitics you can't speak about
01:59:25.880 geopolitics without attracting an
01:59:28.159 identity touch point of the two
01:59:29.840 countries that you're that you're
01:59:31.360 talking about I do pakistanis are Savage
01:59:33.239 why do I put Pakistani are Savage in the
01:59:34.639 title because I know Pakistani people
01:59:36.040 are going going to click on it yeah
01:59:37.880 right um so that's another hack which is
01:59:40.920 when you speak to people's identities
01:59:42.320 they they engage and Sh and how do you
01:59:44.000 identify Niche identities there's just
01:59:46.639 large islands man there's so many
01:59:48.199 identities how figure that out like if
01:59:50.119 I'm a content creator the language you
01:59:51.920 speak at home that's one identity the
01:59:53.920 job you do that's one identity the
01:59:55.440 family you grow up around that's one
01:59:56.599 identity you went to na identity is the
01:59:58.560 easiest One Nation identity is the
01:59:59.760 easiest one what in India there are so
02:00:01.440 many because we have 5,000 identities
02:00:03.320 there are 5,000 Islands ICC cbsc how do
02:00:06.880 I find a small enough identity why do
02:00:09.840 you need to find a small why do you need
02:00:11.040 to find a small because the smaller it
02:00:12.679 is the more they'll share you said right
02:00:14.000 no no the biggest one the biggest one is
02:00:16.560 country then the most specific are the
02:00:19.599 most specific that that kind of help I'm
02:00:21.599 taking specific as smaller so what are
02:00:23.320 these identities which are unutilized
02:00:25.000 it's countries you have no idea when
02:00:26.400 people actually start content creation
02:00:27.960 like influencers in America they go
02:00:30.960 where they go to the Philippines because
02:00:33.159 when a white guy collaborate with
02:00:35.000 Indians now when a white yeah and then
02:00:36.520 when a white guy goes to the Philippines
02:00:37.719 says I ate Filipino food yeah huge huge
02:00:41.199 huge huge same with India actually I got
02:00:44.320 I got push back I got cancelled because
02:00:46.360 I made so many videos in the Philippines
02:00:48.159 because they were like oh you just using
02:00:49.360 us to get views which it wasn't true I
02:00:51.159 actually really like the Philippines but
02:00:52.679 anyway that was thing also
02:00:55.199 yes also no I want to 70
02:00:58.480 countries can I can I say something
02:01:01.159 there's something that I've realized
02:01:02.520 with the whole Regional targeting of
02:01:05.199 content right and I'm correct me if I'm
02:01:07.520 wrong this is just something
02:01:09.360 also this is something I've felt uh in
02:01:12.760 the past 2 three years and that has
02:01:14.360 helped me as a Creator in taking the
02:01:16.040 pressure off of
02:01:17.480 numbers for example
02:01:20.079 when I started off I in my head content
02:01:23.800 creators had a pyramid right if you had
02:01:26.320 more numbers you were on top and then as
02:01:28.280 you had lesser numbers you were on the
02:01:29.520 bottom of the food chain it's a reverse
02:01:31.199 pyramid reverse
02:01:33.000 pyramid yeah I like that one go on but
02:01:36.079 at this point I feel like it's a globe
02:01:38.719 where one person's top is other person's
02:01:41.320 bottom if a brand has to come to me to
02:01:45.560 Market a product in a certain language
02:01:48.719 that is spoken in a certain part of the
02:01:50.560 country that I don't speak I could have
02:01:53.119 millions and millions of followers but
02:01:54.599 I'm useless doesn't matter it does not
02:01:57.079 matter of a a Creator who speaks the
02:01:59.880 regional language has the regional
02:02:01.679 references and has 100th of my numbers
02:02:04.840 could charge a premium could charge a
02:02:06.440 premium and get that much Roi yep for
02:02:09.800 the brand so at this point Regional
02:02:13.040 content has reached a point where the
02:02:15.040 whole dynamics of the Creator economy
02:02:18.599 have shifted it to really depends on
02:02:20.920 where you're coming from and whom do you
02:02:22.960 want to talk to and Supply is lower so
02:02:24.679 you can also charge more exactly Nelson
02:02:26.719 Mandela said an amazing quote if you
02:02:28.639 speak to me if you speak to a man in a
02:02:31.040 language that he learned it goes to his
02:02:33.320 brain yes if you speak to a man in his
02:02:36.079 native language it goes to his heart I
02:02:38.920 have something to add to that from the
02:02:40.119 Indian context I've always believed that
02:02:42.800 the in India the English content you do
02:02:45.119 it for the money the Hindi content you
02:02:46.639 do it for the power yeah that makes
02:02:48.520 sense it goes go to the heart you can
02:02:51.000 actually influence people's lives like
02:02:52.440 Hindi content you do for money no no
02:02:54.280 English content you for forone it's
02:02:56.079 higher brand value brand brand managers
02:02:57.880 can speak English that that's true brand
02:02:59.840 managers can speak the decision makers
02:03:01.760 when it com to influenc marketing we
02:03:03.119 know no also also rir higher arpu for
02:03:05.440 English speaking people also before we
02:03:07.440 leave this topic I want to ask what are
02:03:10.079 the tools a new Creator can use today to
02:03:13.400 translate like what works what doesn't
02:03:15.719 AI has Sol this hey Jen hey
02:03:19.520 is now ai dubbing spell it h e y g n GN
02:03:23.960 uh actually I built a company called is
02:03:25.920 that is that better than dubbing paying
02:03:27.679 somebody to dub uh it's very expensive
02:03:29.599 so paying somebody to you need an agency
02:03:31.159 it's $100 per minute also maybe I mean I
02:03:34.360 please give your opinions I don't know
02:03:35.840 if it's the best decision to dub
02:03:37.239 straight from the beginning of your
02:03:38.360 content yeah do not do that yeah just
02:03:40.000 start with one language don't even
02:03:41.480 consider it is content as a skill it is
02:03:43.360 a skill it's it's different from film
02:03:45.559 making like you need to understand how
02:03:47.400 social media works and evolves yeah so
02:03:49.440 maybe at the start just create your
02:03:51.480 initial only did this when after I hit
02:03:54.000 15 million followers so then you use
02:03:56.760 something like then you start 13
02:03:58.159 languages yeah different langu and you
02:03:59.440 you're saying AI works just as well as
02:04:01.679 dubbing to in the next two months it
02:04:03.719 will be just as good it be so damn cheap
02:04:06.239 is already very good look cost to make
02:04:09.280 and duplicate content is going to zero
02:04:11.760 we're almost there but doesn't it look
02:04:13.000 weird when your mouth is doing anymore
02:04:15.000 no not anymore it's going to get built
02:04:16.760 in on YouTube Nik there's going to be a
02:04:19.000 button where you can select a language
02:04:20.599 and your mouth will move in that
02:04:21.840 language it's going to come into YouTube
02:04:23.199 it's going to take forever cuz YouTube
02:04:24.599 is a slightly slower moving beast but
02:04:26.280 it's going to come do subtitles work so
02:04:28.760 interestingly enough there's two types
02:04:30.199 of countries in the world there's a
02:04:31.320 subtitle country and a dubbing country
02:04:33.040 Germany is a dubbing country that's why
02:04:34.639 when you go visit Germany nobody speaks
02:04:36.320 English because they watch Hollywood
02:04:38.239 dubbed but in Serbia and in my country
02:04:42.119 it's at subtitle country so I would
02:04:43.800 watch movies but I would read subtitles
02:04:46.119 that's why my I speak English thank God
02:04:48.800 I was born in a subtitled country and
02:04:50.440 this is what scares me about dubbing
02:04:51.880 it'll make you not learn the
02:04:54.159 language what works in India India is a
02:04:56.840 subtitle country I think I think only n
02:05:00.079 will have the answer um actually may be
02:05:02.280 a dubbing cont hey what what about viral
02:05:04.599 signaling I know a lot of actors in
02:05:07.400 business people do can you explain what
02:05:08.719 virtue signaling is pretending to be a
02:05:12.559 saint whereas you are as human as all of
02:05:14.960 us like signaling how virtuous you are
02:05:17.639 on social media if you survive long
02:05:19.400 enough on social media people know
02:05:20.679 exactly who you are yeah exactly what
02:05:22.280 signaling works nikil it does work but
02:05:25.440 it creates an expectation out of you
02:05:27.440 that's hard to sustain because not
02:05:30.000 everybody is as virtuous as they claim
02:05:31.719 to be nobody is nobody is so you can
02:05:34.480 virtue signal and it does it does work
02:05:36.520 which is people will like you and people
02:05:38.559 will think a certain way of you yeah but
02:05:39.880 I'm talking about somebody who wants to
02:05:42.000 become a Creator 20y old will virtal
02:05:44.840 signaling work for someone like that not
02:05:47.320 I think at that stage is important just
02:05:48.880 stand out all this comes later I think
02:05:51.000 it's a way to hack the yeah what's the
02:05:52.679 point of signaling your virtues in
02:05:54.400 emptiness like you need a large audience
02:05:56.079 to Signal your do get your audience then
02:05:58.239 virtu you also not know what the virtue
02:06:00.159 is for a very long
02:06:02.840 time begin by being anti anti anti
02:06:06.400 whatever and when you have an audience
02:06:08.280 become more virtuous and resonate with
02:06:10.040 whatever societ Society if you have a
02:06:11.800 large enough audience you will need to
02:06:13.360 display your virtue at some point or
02:06:15.000 you'll find the need to when is that
02:06:16.559 point it could be when when audience
02:06:18.960 start to ask you to virtually signal
02:06:20.840 when your audience start to ask you
02:06:21.880 what's your opinion about Israel and
02:06:23.119 Palestine yeah when they start speaking
02:06:24.480 back cross that point I've crossed that
02:06:26.320 actually all of you have crossed that
02:06:27.480 point your audience will expect what
02:06:30.320 they think you will respond to yes right
02:06:33.159 if you continuously virtually signal
02:06:34.960 about my thoughts on what the political
02:06:37.719 Affairs are and if you keep talking
02:06:39.320 about that at some point if you go quiet
02:06:41.280 your audience will be like yo what
02:06:42.199 happened why aren't you op opining about
02:06:44.159 this or even something as simple as
02:06:46.239 relationships when creators share about
02:06:48.599 their relationship online and then they
02:06:51.159 go all out uh sharing talking about it
02:06:54.159 even doing brand deals things like that
02:06:56.199 and then when that falls out and your
02:06:59.119 audience expects you to answer I don't
02:07:01.639 think that's a time you can take a stand
02:07:03.280 saying oh no I want my space yeah but
02:07:05.960 what I recommend to people is that the
02:07:07.800 image that they are in real life should
02:07:09.719 be online is so important yeah I I have
02:07:12.719 a that's interesting
02:07:15.119 uh with social media so much of you is
02:07:18.280 out there okay um because of the show I
02:07:21.920 met a lot of people who mentored me in
02:07:24.079 many ways uh and I tried being the best
02:07:27.760 possible dude in real life wasn't
02:07:30.119 successful everywhere made mistakes but
02:07:32.679 a lot of that rubbed off for example
02:07:34.800 like it began like my channel began as a
02:07:36.760 fitness channel maximize your Fitness I
02:07:39.760 worked on my mental health in order to
02:07:41.239 talk about mental health content I won't
02:07:43.079 make yoga content until I've mastered
02:07:45.000 yoga and I've begun yoga since the last
02:07:46.400 year so if you have a vis vision of what
02:07:49.000 kind of content you want to make start
02:07:50.760 working on it right now you can fake it
02:07:53.159 till you make it but for how long I mean
02:07:55.520 it's possible to fake it till you make
02:07:56.639 it yeah you can I mean that's true I
02:07:59.320 also feel like collaborations are very
02:08:01.159 very powerful when you start a creative
02:08:04.520 Journey that's interesting go into that
02:08:06.199 how does how does a new person
02:08:07.840 collaborate and who do they collaborate
02:08:09.559 with with other new people like people
02:08:11.360 who are near your numbers how do you
02:08:13.159 find them or you can be ambitious like I
02:08:15.159 remember shooting Lily a text as as
02:08:18.559 often as I could till it happened yeah
02:08:20.199 we all have short liia text at some
02:08:21.559 point until it actually happened I
02:08:23.800 remember shooting uh or like just kind
02:08:26.760 of manifesting in my head and wanting to
02:08:29.440 do something with Ric rash and I'm a
02:08:31.040 huge fan till that happened but that's
02:08:33.079 that took a long long time I'm just
02:08:35.079 saying in general I have learned so much
02:08:37.520 what works when you message these people
02:08:39.079 what can one say that will work hi I'm a
02:08:42.079 Creator and this is what I do and I
02:08:44.040 really really like your work and if you
02:08:45.559 have some time I would love to share
02:08:47.880 something with you doesn't work it
02:08:49.159 doesn't work though it's just whenever
02:08:50.960 you asking someone anything their time
02:08:54.119 money especially their time especially
02:08:56.040 their time you got to understand what
02:08:58.159 would incentivize them you must give
02:09:00.400 them value yeah when I speak about
02:09:02.159 collaborations I also speak about
02:09:03.679 friendships and uh allies in the Creator
02:09:06.679 Community see I'm a Creator beginning
02:09:08.800 today I want to be a part of a ecosystem
02:09:13.119 with other curators and creators how do
02:09:15.599 I find them when I started off I don't
02:09:17.800 know I don't think YouTube does that
02:09:19.320 anymore but when I started off I
02:09:20.719 remember telling my partner manager at
02:09:22.320 YouTube or just shooting text to YouTube
02:09:24.360 saying what is the partner manager at
02:09:25.880 YouTube you'll have a partner manager on
02:09:27.239 YouTube who's looking after your account
02:09:28.800 and is who you can sit down with every
02:09:30.880 now and back anymore back in the day
02:09:33.800 there were fewer creators now to get a
02:09:36.040 to be eligible for a partner manager you
02:09:37.440 need to have X th000 hours of watch time
02:09:40.040 x number of subscribers Etc ET it's hard
02:09:42.159 now the number of partner managers per
02:09:44.159 Creator is like is very low a lot uh so
02:09:46.440 I I remember telling her that if there's
02:09:47.920 any kind of of social Gathering any kind
02:09:49.920 of uh panel discussion any kind of
02:09:52.639 Creator um Workshop happening please
02:09:55.920 please sign me up for this because I
02:09:57.760 want to go and meet other people and I
02:10:00.239 want to do that what we can do now is uh
02:10:04.480 I I feel like a lot of creators like a
02:10:06.239 lot of newer creators now I meet at
02:10:08.400 social events done by YouTube or
02:10:10.159 Facebook or Instagram and I just feel
02:10:12.280 like is that a good hat to show up at
02:10:13.840 these events in show up at yeah like
02:10:18.400 like finding these finding these hubs
02:10:21.880 where conversation relevant to what you
02:10:23.880 are doing or in the realm of your life
02:10:26.760 as a Creator are happening and kind of
02:10:28.199 wanting to be in those places there is
02:10:29.800 something called non-consensual
02:10:31.520 collaboration what is that okay for
02:10:33.800 example this is a growing Trend now
02:10:36.040 which is if you want to collaborate with
02:10:38.159 someone you get your you start talking
02:10:40.960 about how you want to collaborate with
02:10:42.159 this person and you get your whole
02:10:43.679 follower base to go start spamming them
02:10:45.599 in message saying this person wants to
02:10:47.079 do something with you right all so what
02:10:50.320 the algorithm is doing is the algorithm
02:10:51.880 is recognizing that this person is
02:10:53.800 talking about this person so the video
02:10:55.400 automatically starts getting recommend
02:10:56.559 to people who follow this person this
02:10:58.159 happens on YouTube all the time it start
02:10:59.679 happening on Instagram Etc ET like why
02:11:01.559 rat COI like why rat Coy that's
02:11:03.760 nonconsensual collaboration this dude
02:11:05.440 just kept talking about you know vat I
02:11:07.760 love that uh so non-consensual
02:11:09.719 collaboration is one but generally
02:11:11.840 speaking you want to collaborate with
02:11:14.440 people you are more likely to get a yes
02:11:16.719 to collaborate one so people want to
02:11:19.119 collaborate up but that's hard so you
02:11:21.360 want to start collaborating sideways
02:11:23.079 yeah makes sense thumbnails and titles
02:11:25.639 how important are they very important
02:11:29.119 not
02:11:30.079 important not really at all
02:11:34.159 zero should we debate yeah go ahead why
02:11:37.400 is it
02:11:38.320 important
02:11:39.840 um Sizzle matters as much as
02:11:45.159 steak uh Sizzle Sizzle matters
02:11:48.760 um I mean there's enough documented
02:11:51.719 evidence that suggests that I mean Mr
02:11:53.760 Beast is a great example just last week
02:11:55.360 he was tweeting about how videos where
02:11:57.480 he closes his mouth get a lot more views
02:12:00.000 than video than thumbnails where his
02:12:01.599 mouth is open I thought he said the
02:12:03.239 other thing thumbnails when his mouth is
02:12:05.280 open get more views cuz then people
02:12:07.760 either on either on basically he changed
02:12:09.360 oneth is open people think he's saying
02:12:11.320 something and want to click it yeah so
02:12:13.639 either or which is oh he changed one
02:12:15.199 variable and that that made a big
02:12:16.840 difference both I mean there's no how
02:12:19.599 can you disagree boring title I mean of
02:12:21.520 course short on short video it's the
02:12:24.159 short video is completely different I'm
02:12:25.520 trying to say is there's only one
02:12:27.040 platform and one type of video where
02:12:30.000 thumbnail and title matter which is a
02:12:31.920 long video on YouTube on YouTube yeah
02:12:34.400 the majority of people watching this are
02:12:36.320 going to be uploading Instagram reals
02:12:38.760 yes on an Instagram reals the title
02:12:40.400 doesn't matter thil thumnail doesn't
02:12:41.960 matter doesn't matter in fact no one
02:12:43.440 should be stressing over this at the
02:12:44.880 beginning just stress over the first 3
02:12:47.239 seconds of the video the first sentence
02:12:49.000 that you say in the video yeah so on Tik
02:12:50.920 Tok thumbnails don't matter on Instagram
02:12:52.920 thumbnails don't matter and on Facebook
02:12:54.400 thumbnails don't matter and in YouTube
02:12:55.760 short THS don't matter only on YouTube
02:12:59.000 long videos so for YouTube videos what
02:13:02.920 do you do how do you make a thumbnail
02:13:04.880 and a title that works I've delegated
02:13:07.440 everything in my organization when it
02:13:08.960 comes to video content other than
02:13:10.040 actually coming on screen titling and
02:13:12.679 thumbnails are things I've not been able
02:13:14.840 to delegate and I have I have two like
02:13:17.639 other channels I have B biceps which is
02:13:19.719 English ranir Hindi there's TRS clips
02:13:22.280 English and TRS Clips Hindi the titles
02:13:24.599 are done by me and the thumbnails also
02:13:27.000 suggested just want to suggest some
02:13:28.360 things that people could follow you
02:13:29.440 should probably check out Paddy Galloway
02:13:31.559 he does um he does a YouTube course and
02:13:34.119 he talks a lot about titling and
02:13:35.239 thumbnail follow this guy called Papa
02:13:36.719 okus on Twitter he's an Indian kid who
02:13:39.679 is deeply into it sorry I just wanted to
02:13:41.639 throw in so when it comes to titles
02:13:43.599 there's very easy wins okay how why what
02:13:48.400 start the title with how and why because
02:13:51.679 the average human really wants to know
02:13:55.199 why Greenland is not actually
02:13:57.599 green the human brain really wants to
02:14:00.119 know how aquariums work okay so how and
02:14:04.079 Y is a very easy win the second easy win
02:14:06.520 is superlatives and we teach all this at
02:14:08.159 NAS Academy I've done this 50 times
02:14:11.119 superlatives everybody wants to know the
02:14:13.520 story of the world's tallest man yeah
02:14:16.840 everybody wants to know who is the
02:14:18.559 world's youngest billionaire yeah who is
02:14:21.559 it you know
02:14:24.639 so so so so extremes and how and why and
02:14:29.400 the last one is uh uh Paradox so the the
02:14:35.239 the the unhappy
02:14:37.639 billionaire well you ass assume a
02:14:39.760 billionaire is always happy right why
02:14:41.960 they unhappy contradictory so that's the
02:14:44.239 three biggest categories for things that
02:14:45.960 going to click on is there a tool that
02:14:47.440 you can use that will help in this
02:14:49.719 pattern recognition if you take if you
02:14:51.599 pirate the nas Academy course and put it
02:14:53.520 into
02:14:54.440 CH share it why I just like pay money
02:14:58.400 why I the call is there a course on how
02:15:01.760 to put good thumbnails and titles uh
02:15:04.639 yeah yeah like it's a module but but
02:15:06.360 there I don't know if there's a and how
02:15:07.400 much do you
02:15:08.480 charge the price is not India friendly
02:15:11.079 tell tell us it's $3,000 for five months
02:15:14.199 but it's five month five month cohort
02:15:16.040 what somebody just wants to learn this
02:15:18.239 you can't just go to YouTube get you
02:15:19.920 pirate it and you get it for free stop
02:15:23.040 it because you we don't make money okay
02:15:25.840 you guys tips thumbnail and
02:15:28.480 titles I have for me these things didn't
02:15:31.400 work like after a point maybe it's
02:15:33.840 because I have a larger quantity of
02:15:35.480 content so then I need to bring novelty
02:15:37.400 to the titles and all that I try
02:15:39.520 focusing on first three words that's all
02:15:42.599 and what do you do in the first three
02:15:43.960 words actually learned it from you I
02:15:45.559 think you had suggested this first three
02:15:46.880 words it it's to it has to match the
02:15:50.480 content of the video um shocking secret
02:15:55.480 is what works in India um dark these
02:15:59.440 kind of words that create an emotion
02:16:01.360 give us some more shocking secret dark
02:16:03.920 then
02:16:06.320 Twisted um because when you say that
02:16:08.880 people in you you're playing the
02:16:11.000 inquisitiveness SC yeah yeah but again
02:16:13.639 this I I used to believe in set formulas
02:16:16.440 for titles and TRS clips English and
02:16:18.800 Hindi taught me otherwise it was just a
02:16:20.520 very brutal experience for me and it's
02:16:22.639 still a brutal experience I think some
02:16:24.599 things that could help people are just
02:16:26.320 observe your own behavior when you're
02:16:27.840 when you're clicking on videos If just
02:16:29.440 that one moment of self-reflection
02:16:31.000 saying what made me click on click on it
02:16:33.200 outside of what noar also said I agree
02:16:35.080 with that uh The Tam of your video
02:16:37.439 really matters which is totally
02:16:38.478 addressable market like you could have a
02:16:40.200 paradoxical title about something that
02:16:41.920 nobody cares about and it would not get
02:16:43.638 views it should be it should be a broad
02:16:46.080 Tam um yeah that's what what I want also
02:16:48.519 also copy uh successful videos so look
02:16:50.799 at a a viral video like go to like like
02:16:53.080 a VX Channel and sort the videos by
02:16:55.959 popular popularity great hack and then
02:16:57.920 just a copy the thumbnail and copy the
02:16:59.558 title yeah yeah so one hack is you could
02:17:01.840 go to any YouTube channel of the genre
02:17:04.959 that you are operating in so if if ranir
02:17:06.799 was starting out and he was talking
02:17:08.040 about Fitness I would say go to the top
02:17:10.000 10 Fitness channels that that are
02:17:11.920 existing go to videos click on most
02:17:13.920 popular and just see the subjects that
02:17:15.879 have done really well it Auto starts
02:17:17.920 your first 20 videos are already there
02:17:19.439 it's just the first I really hope
02:17:21.718 anybody watching this I cannot stress it
02:17:23.318 enough do not start your career by
02:17:25.040 making Long YouTube videos it will ruin
02:17:28.280 your dream there's no discoverability
02:17:30.160 engine in this like just like this is
02:17:32.599 only when you're big enough for now
02:17:34.519 focus on Tik Tok Instagram yeah but this
02:17:37.398 comes with caveats for example for
02:17:39.478 example you want you you could do long
02:17:42.638 videos for example if you're a bunch of
02:17:44.160 friends you want to start a podcast you
02:17:45.679 could but you optimize for for short
02:17:48.080 video output yes that's what you
02:17:50.080 optimize for you could do long form
02:17:51.558 video but likelihood of success is very
02:17:53.120 low you you optimize for short video
02:17:55.359 output yes in fact now a lot of people
02:17:57.920 actually do podcast very much keeping in
02:17:59.718 mind that I'm actually not shooting a
02:18:01.519 2hour podcast I'm shooting 20 Clips yeah
02:18:03.879 that's fine you were say like when we
02:18:05.760 used to do this right when we started
02:18:07.200 off we would upload a YouTube video and
02:18:09.160 back Instagram had just started video on
02:18:12.359 it so we used to cut a 20 second trailer
02:18:16.439 from our video and and then put it on
02:18:18.799 Instagram and say full video on YouTube
02:18:21.558 but that did wonders for us so I feel
02:18:23.760 like you can use that model right now by
02:18:26.840 what he's saying like make a longer
02:18:28.200 video but then optimize it by cut tiny
02:18:31.318 bits of it and putting but make the
02:18:32.718 short video ha not like a teaser hul
02:18:36.160 like from beginning to end a story not
02:18:38.359 saying hey go to YouTube to see the rest
02:18:39.799 cuz nobody will go to YouTube these days
02:18:41.280 that doesn't work no if you put a part
02:18:43.920 of something and say go here to watch
02:18:45.558 full it could depends on it depends on
02:18:48.240 what it is I have seen that plays into
02:18:49.718 your early story of that 3 2 one one
02:18:51.920 being the big thing yeah it it it can
02:18:54.558 work changing apps to do that is a
02:18:57.240 Monumental T from YouTube short to
02:18:58.920 YouTube full yeah that there CU there's
02:19:00.840 a feature now which can just one click
02:19:02.519 and you go to the main last week as of
02:19:04.638 last week that's fine but before that it
02:19:06.200 was very hard yeah projector tips title
02:19:09.318 and thumbnail what worked for you I
02:19:11.359 don't know I really don't know uh I
02:19:14.359 think I was just winging it I don't
02:19:15.760 think I was putting any sort of logic
02:19:17.599 science to it when I was doing it I
02:19:19.318 would go week to week if there's a video
02:19:21.280 that worked I was so focused on the
02:19:26.638 engagement under the video and
02:19:28.478 understanding the content that I think
02:19:30.040 what I could have done better was that
02:19:32.080 also put some focus on the title and
02:19:33.638 thumbnail I don't think I did that this
02:19:35.318 I don't know thing is key because
02:19:36.638 actually everyone's building their own
02:19:38.000 inherent communities and often if it's a
02:19:39.760 content creator only the content creator
02:19:41.558 not even like the second in command
02:19:42.799 third in command understand the
02:19:43.920 community's pulse as well so there is an
02:19:47.200 ID I don't know even like when I'm
02:19:48.318 starting to write the titles I don't
02:19:49.359 know where they come out from but they
02:19:50.479 come out well right give me one unique
02:19:54.399 hack each that you guys learned along
02:19:58.920 your illustrious Journeys like decade
02:20:01.120 decade decade decade plus
02:20:03.760 right what the have we been doing this
02:20:06.080 far it's all been insights that we have
02:20:08.760 learned over the last DEC one hack one
02:20:11.399 hack to a 20-year-old boy or girl who
02:20:13.840 wants to become a Creator um when you're
02:20:17.000 starting off don't care as much about
02:20:20.800 expensive equipment setups money
02:20:24.479 investment marketing when you're
02:20:27.000 starting off equipment doesn't matter
02:20:28.600 that much no as long I mean you have
02:20:30.080 cell phones right now that have cameras
02:20:31.720 with good sound good video even if it's
02:20:33.600 a basic one whatever you're
02:20:37.319 using most of them are good most of them
02:20:39.439 are good as long as your video is crisp
02:20:42.280 clear visible and your sound is audible
02:20:45.680 I think you're good to start off do you
02:20:47.600 think increased
02:20:49.800 Clarity leads to increased views like
02:20:52.880 the production quality production
02:20:55.359 quality doesn't lead to at some point it
02:20:56.880 becomes inverse that's what we've
02:20:58.880 observed is I remember ban talking about
02:21:01.479 it where buan used to shoot on his phone
02:21:03.680 all his videos and he spoke about how he
02:21:05.680 moved to a camera setup and his
02:21:07.399 engagement went down I think people use
02:21:09.560 Instagram with the intention of relating
02:21:11.439 a little bit at least with Instagram
02:21:13.200 reals we've noticed that when we create
02:21:15.399 a real with SLR footage it doesn't
02:21:17.280 doesn't work as well as when you do it
02:21:18.520 with iPhone footage like phone footage
02:21:21.080 in general I don't we I don't know why
02:21:23.399 that is here's my hack um the problem
02:21:27.000 actually for most creators is they are
02:21:29.640 too shy to hit publish and or they take
02:21:33.280 too long to publish a video so they like
02:21:35.520 ah I work on this video today it's not
02:21:37.319 perfect yet I'll work on it tomorrow and
02:21:38.840 then tomorrow tomorrow work expands to
02:21:41.319 the time allowed for it work expands to
02:21:44.240 the time allowed for it which means if
02:21:46.200 you give yourself a deadline line of 10
02:21:48.080 days to make a video you will make that
02:21:50.040 video in 10 days and it'll take you 10
02:21:52.200 days of work but if you commit to make a
02:21:54.359 video every five days and this is my
02:21:56.840 deadline on the fifth day I must hit
02:21:58.920 publish yeah no matter what happens
02:22:00.800 you'll make it you'll make the same
02:22:02.160 quality video in five days in fact I was
02:22:04.280 when you were asking for hacks I was
02:22:05.760 going to say that uh most people who are
02:22:08.880 most people who come to me and ask me
02:22:10.240 for tips to do YouTube actually all they
02:22:12.240 want to hear is just just hit publish
02:22:14.280 just hit publish just do it most people
02:22:15.880 want to ask for advice thinking there's
02:22:17.399 some secret thing that YouTubers or
02:22:19.680 creators know it's really not not a
02:22:22.040 thing there's nothing that will teach
02:22:23.160 you more than uploading five times so so
02:22:25.319 with n daily my deadline was 24 hours
02:22:27.439 every 24 hours I must hit publish even
02:22:29.479 if I if I really really hate the video I
02:22:31.640 must publish it and so that pushing to H
02:22:34.840 you to and you must commit publicly to
02:22:36.880 it and another thing is when you say oh
02:22:38.960 privately I'll just do a video every day
02:22:41.080 but actually when I found work the
02:22:43.040 pressure of when you go and tell all
02:22:45.080 your family members and all your friends
02:22:46.720 and every on Facebook I've committed to
02:22:48.960 losing weight or I've committed to
02:22:50.399 making 100 videos in 100 days you will
02:22:52.600 do it also adding on to that I feel like
02:22:54.840 if you are getting into it as a creator
02:22:56.439 for a longer Run please treat it as a
02:22:58.720 job and get that discipline into it I
02:23:01.840 but how do you how do you make that
02:23:02.960 switch like today if I have college or a
02:23:05.160 job and I'm earning say 50,000 Rupees a
02:23:07.880 month I'm spending some money my spare
02:23:11.399 time creating content when do I make
02:23:14.439 decis spare time tell yourself that if
02:23:16.760 I'm working work say a 9: to5 I come
02:23:18.880 home I say chill with friends or work
02:23:21.000 out and stuff like that but I'm going to
02:23:22.080 give myself a 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. to
02:23:23.920 sit and ID at content when you're
02:23:25.720 starting off another question who do you
02:23:28.520 learn from because we looked online and
02:23:31.200 could not
02:23:32.319 find anything useful really in how to
02:23:35.399 become a Creator my next hack sorry my
02:23:37.359 next hack if you're about to start
02:23:38.880 content creation ditch your friends say
02:23:41.880 goodbye to your friends your friends
02:23:43.960 will be a hindrance to you because your
02:23:47.160 friends are doing N9 to-5 jobs lawyer
02:23:48.920 accountant KPMG engineer okay when
02:23:51.279 you're uploading that video you will
02:23:52.600 feel so alone you'll never have felt
02:23:55.279 lonier in your life so the first thing I
02:23:58.040 did when I started Nas daily I literally
02:23:59.680 said to all my friends in New York
02:24:02.560 goodbye I'm going to Kenya by myself and
02:24:05.760 I'm going to make videos and so that's
02:24:07.600 my my recommendation is one ditch your
02:24:10.399 existing friends CU you're about to
02:24:11.640 enter a whole new industry and two
02:24:13.640 surround yourself with new types of
02:24:15.160 friends that are from the creative
02:24:16.640 industry the ones that don't shame you
02:24:18.720 for screaming in front of a video my
02:24:20.720 existing friends shamed me I don't know
02:24:22.520 if that can be like a blanket advice to
02:24:24.560 everyone I want to be controversial of
02:24:25.960 course with a one minute
02:24:28.640 video no what I'm saying about every
02:24:30.920 kind of content I don't think that could
02:24:32.800 be advice that could be used by everyone
02:24:34.479 making every kind of content that's how
02:24:36.800 you started but for me when I started
02:24:38.600 off I needed those two friends of mine
02:24:40.319 because one of them came to hold the
02:24:41.720 camera for me the first time so they're
02:24:43.560 helping you with the content okay so
02:24:45.680 this your friends that don't help you
02:24:46.840 with with the content yeah ditch your
02:24:48.000 friends who aren't unconditionally
02:24:49.520 supportive all the time that you should
02:24:51.640 ditch
02:24:52.720 anyway be a Creator to ditch those
02:24:55.120 friends yeah right you could be a lawyer
02:24:57.120 you could be a teacher and if they're
02:24:58.240 not supportive you should dit them true
02:25:00.800 fair enough yeah more one more I
02:25:04.640 actually don't know if it's a this is a
02:25:06.200 thing that a lot of people
02:25:07.720 ask should I quit my job what is the
02:25:10.359 optimal time to to like to leave your
02:25:13.920 job like nikil I think touched on this
02:25:15.600 like is it when you start making as much
02:25:18.080 money as your job does and or when you
02:25:20.960 start making slightly lesser money but
02:25:22.600 you think there's the there's the
02:25:23.600 potential potential for it what do you
02:25:25.560 think I'm asking you oh for me okay I
02:25:27.680 actually don't think about it in terms
02:25:28.920 of money I think about it in terms of
02:25:30.479 time so the question is if I don't have
02:25:32.399 a job today how many months do I need to
02:25:36.200 figure out a new career in content
02:25:38.120 creation so I I needed one year to test
02:25:41.359 content creation how much money do I
02:25:42.960 spend in one year I need to save that so
02:25:45.000 the question the answer was like 30,000
02:25:47.040 $40,000 in New York which is a lot of
02:25:48.920 money so I saved that and then I was
02:25:50.720 like okay I have one year of Freedom
02:25:52.720 let's just go all in on content but the
02:25:54.960 end of the year it doesn't work I'm back
02:25:56.720 to a job very few people are able to
02:25:59.000 succeed while also doing another thing
02:26:01.240 yeah it's it's NE NE it's very tough to
02:26:03.840 do that if you do you're really talented
02:26:06.279 Elon Musk yeah you're really talented at
02:26:08.200 being able to figure out in your spare
02:26:09.880 time how to crush it at the content
02:26:11.240 thing so it requires you to make that
02:26:14.680 jump to actually fully succeed while
02:26:17.240 you're doing something start yeah get a
02:26:20.040 sense of we talked about the and economy
02:26:22.279 you can still be a doctor and a Creator
02:26:24.200 if you make one video per week yeah but
02:26:26.080 if you make one video per day there's no
02:26:27.720 space for anything yeah I have warnings
02:26:30.359 rather than hacks uh two warnings first
02:26:34.080 don't do it if you're too sensitive and
02:26:36.160 don't do it if you don't enjoy the
02:26:38.080 actual process of creating videos at
02:26:40.479 this stage maybe later on animated
02:26:42.479 content will become more mainstream and
02:26:44.040 doable but right now it's a lot about
02:26:46.200 shooting
02:26:47.319 lighting thinking what you want to show
02:26:49.200 in your video so unless you're you're
02:26:51.560 truly having fun with creating something
02:26:53.600 and showing it to people don't do it
02:26:55.920 also I feel like be okay with the fact
02:26:58.000 that you'll never completely get it
02:27:00.960 you'll never completely have a grip on
02:27:02.760 it you will constantly be learning you
02:27:05.760 will constantly be evolving and be okay
02:27:08.439 with that
02:27:09.359 change um because I feel like if you
02:27:11.920 enter being a content creator thinking
02:27:13.680 okay I've got it I know how to do it I
02:27:16.160 have it all in place it's I think you're
02:27:18.319 just going to fall flat it's a very
02:27:20.120 cliche thing but be original is too too
02:27:23.560 cliche but I think a better way to say
02:27:25.680 it is blind copying can only take you
02:27:29.080 this far blind copying can take it can
02:27:32.359 take you to a distance but beyond that
02:27:35.040 you got to have your your own spin on it
02:27:37.120 otherwise it's not long
02:27:39.319 lasting money uncomfortable question we
02:27:42.240 love money we should all say exactly how
02:27:44.359 much money we make right here okay good
02:27:46.000 good idea start
02:27:49.359 we know 77,000 tomorrow but what about
02:27:52.880 other days so my financial journey is
02:27:55.120 actually very transparent and I love
02:27:56.720 sharing it because it's so I started
02:27:58.760 with $30,000 in savings I spent one year
02:28:01.040 I didn't make any money until I started
02:28:03.399 to make $1,000 $2,000 a month from jobs
02:28:06.800 when I had 100,000 followers a job brand
02:28:08.800 deal comes here a brand comes here I was
02:28:10.080 charging $1,000 $2,000 then Facebook
02:28:12.279 introduced monetization I started to
02:28:13.920 make money from my uh Channel I started
02:28:16.240 to make $10,000 a month and that was for
02:28:19.160 me like I made it and how much traction
02:28:21.040 did you have I had a million followers
02:28:23.040 so a million followers on Facebook I was
02:28:24.479 making $10,000 a month and then the
02:28:26.640 beauty of the Creator economy is that it
02:28:29.040 doesn't go in a straight line your
02:28:31.279 salary goes up in a straight line if you
02:28:33.359 have a job 10% 10% 10% every month but
02:28:36.359 if you're a content creator your salary
02:28:38.439 will go up like this and so this is what
02:28:41.080 happened to me so 1 million followers
02:28:42.319 became 10 million followers okay
02:28:43.560 Facebook started to give me $30,000 a
02:28:45.359 month okay then my brand Deal started to
02:28:47.399 be another $330,000 a month then
02:28:49.080 speaking engagements another $20,000 a
02:28:50.840 month so now I was averaging $8,000 a
02:28:52.920 month I finished 1,000 days three years
02:28:55.279 in I was making $80,000 a month
02:28:58.800 amazing okay I became a
02:29:00.960 millionaire first time in my life at age
02:29:03.439 26 amazing then I was like let's build a
02:29:07.520 company because there's much more to
02:29:09.200 this than can be so then we build a
02:29:11.160 Company the company started to make
02:29:12.200 $20,000 making videos for other people
02:29:15.399 you've seen my social media vide
02:29:17.120 let me do it for you your brand okay
02:29:19.840 behind the scenes okay so you start to
02:29:21.680 offer services then you start to
02:29:23.560 monetize your community offer Nas
02:29:25.920 Academy classes Nas Summit Nas travels
02:29:28.200 okay so all in all in all I think this
02:29:30.680 month so I have two companies the
02:29:33.840 combined revenue of that is roughly now
02:29:36.000 $900,000 to a million dollar a month wow
02:29:39.479 and it's from like six seven different
02:29:41.439 sources so it's highly Diversified and
02:29:44.359 probably the profit is roughly 200 K
02:29:47.640 200k 200k USD per month from one company
02:29:51.200 and then other company is losing money
02:29:53.240 so losing 300K is that the company I'm
02:29:55.000 an
02:30:00.000 invested great track
02:30:02.720 record nck genus investor I'm using your
02:30:07.319 money all right that's so uh so that's
02:30:10.479 transparency now let's let me see you be
02:30:12.319 financially naked guys go ahead I I'm
02:30:14.200 not going to yeah me neither why not
02:30:17.840 wiely different but I I I want to be I I
02:30:20.640 want to talk about numbers right um so
02:30:24.640 people I think grossly underestimate how
02:30:26.399 much money YouTube can pay yes right uh
02:30:29.240 in my experience based on India cpms if
02:30:31.640 you get one million uh if you get 1
02:30:34.840 million views you can make like one 1
02:30:39.520 million to 1 lakh Rupees is that is that
02:30:43.479 they varied on the CPM they varied on on
02:30:45.399 the cpms but last largely at some
02:30:47.720 somewhere around that if you get 1
02:30:48.840 million views you can make up to one
02:30:50.600 lakh one lak rupees 1 lak rupes at
02:30:52.520 million but the lower cap is also lower
02:30:54.560 cap can be huh what's it what's lak
02:30:58.240 100,000 100,000 rupees no
02:31:00.399 800,000,000 views in $1,000 in India no
02:31:04.920 way Jose yeah it's $200 H depends again
02:31:08.640 it's it's a it's a a lower he's saying
02:31:10.880 up to a, if you make Financial content
02:31:13.560 for billionaires you'll get $1,000 at
02:31:16.439 neily it really depends on the the ads
02:31:18.279 on your channel for example on my
02:31:19.520 channel uh 80% of the viewers are from
02:31:22.080 India the remaining 20% are from around
02:31:23.960 the world so my cpms are higher a big
02:31:25.920 chunk of my viewers have YouTube premium
02:31:28.160 a big chunk of the people from around
02:31:29.720 the world are actually from the from USA
02:31:31.760 but tell me duration as well like you're
02:31:33.560 saying 1 million views yeah 1 minute 10
02:31:36.800 minute 1 hour that should determine how
02:31:39.800 much you get paid so I the average view
02:31:41.800 duration on my channel is about 9 and a
02:31:43.439 half minutes a video yeah that's why you
02:31:45.200 make yeah that's why
02:31:47.399 probably probably make more um but it's
02:31:49.680 possible to make it's possible to make
02:31:51.399 this much right like and how many views
02:31:53.439 do you get in a month um depends on the
02:31:55.479 month but 20 million is 20 million is
02:31:58.319 comfortable I $220,000 a month $20,000 a
02:32:00.920 month is very very possible um
02:32:03.600 unfortunately India the the businesses
02:32:05.560 that monetizes the audience unless you
02:32:07.160 are selling like finance courses or
02:32:08.800 attech courses um it's it's tough to
02:32:11.479 sell to an audience when you're playing
02:32:13.160 at that scale there's very there's not a
02:32:15.399 lot of stuff that that you can do but
02:32:17.279 branded Revenue wise if you're in the
02:32:19.399 top 5 10% of creators you can make over
02:32:22.840 a million dollar a year come you can you
02:32:25.640 can do that um you can do that in if
02:32:28.080 you're getting how many views not how
02:32:29.840 many views if you're in the top 10
02:32:31.120 percentile creators you're able to make
02:32:33.160 7 10 crores from that means brand
02:32:35.240 influencer marketing is $50 million
02:32:37.080 Market a year no it'll be more than that
02:32:39.279 I think it's more than that already I
02:32:40.359 think it's about 200 million 250 million
02:32:42.520 yeah so I don't think it's less than 50
02:32:44.200 I think about 100 at least 100 plus
02:32:46.240 creators are making more than that from
02:32:47.960 from Brands I'm talking purely from
02:32:50.120 Brands I think from Community they're
02:32:51.279 making billions yeah there are by the
02:32:53.439 way I know many creators who are making
02:32:55.600 uh more from monetizing through courses
02:32:58.840 and that kind of stuff uh that can go
02:33:01.080 that can go higher a lot of lot of uh
02:33:03.960 influencers have affiliate income that's
02:33:06.439 coming from you know what what is the
02:33:08.399 regulation around that what is the
02:33:10.000 confusion around it there's General talk
02:33:13.520 about can we regulate influencers from
02:33:16.439 disseminating financial information if
02:33:18.439 they're not registered with the with
02:33:20.800 with the National
02:33:22.040 Authority um but my thought is also you
02:33:25.600 know mainstream media has been doing
02:33:26.880 this for for very long um you should
02:33:29.720 probably also also look at that a bunch
02:33:31.640 of these TV channels have been have been
02:33:33.359 doing what effectively influencers are
02:33:36.319 accused of accused of doing this for for
02:33:38.160 very long now at a time where media was
02:33:41.120 not as decentralized now so the effect
02:33:44.319 of disseminating financial information
02:33:46.399 during centralized media time was a lot
02:33:48.120 higher that we're all
02:33:49.720 discounting um secondly I actually uh I
02:33:53.359 actually think that netn net influencers
02:33:56.279 have have had a positive impact because
02:33:59.279 there's a whole generation that CNBC was
02:34:01.800 not talking to yeah I agree with you
02:34:03.560 100% there's this this just a large
02:34:05.240 generation that and by the way the
02:34:07.520 information asymmetry was capitalized on
02:34:11.000 yeah right whereas information has has
02:34:12.760 gotten decentralized and accessible to
02:34:14.640 way more people now so I think
02:34:16.600 influencers have done more for for the
02:34:19.080 for the education than TV channels ever
02:34:20.960 did so my personal gut is that you know
02:34:24.560 look at your own backyard for the last
02:34:26.319 you know two decades and then maybe
02:34:28.200 maybe make these challenges and by the
02:34:29.560 way a lot of this will uh you know a lot
02:34:32.439 of Legacy Media houses are not going to
02:34:34.319 like this fact that someone can wake up
02:34:37.080 start making Instagram reels get more
02:34:39.399 distribution than them because I know
02:34:41.040 influencers are making more Revenue than
02:34:43.720 full media houses combined
02:34:46.720 and getting more views making more
02:34:48.120 Revenue there's no reason there there's
02:34:49.520 a reason why they're doing that they're
02:34:51.040 putting out better quality they're
02:34:52.200 putting out better quality so is there
02:34:54.800 Envy yes and are you going to use that
02:34:57.840 muscle to go after people yes and are we
02:35:00.279 going to see more of it yes it's going
02:35:02.520 to happen more and more and more like
02:35:04.560 how we said brands are not your friends
02:35:06.560 Legacy Media houses are not your friends
02:35:09.720 this goes for all influencers they're
02:35:11.880 not your friends your own the lines
02:35:14.520 should not be crossed I feel like
02:35:16.680 of course at some points they were and
02:35:18.479 there should be measures taken to
02:35:20.240 curtail and you know have some kind of a
02:35:22.319 line of course but net net have and
02:35:24.960 apply those rules to everyone yeah apply
02:35:26.920 those rules to everyone rules have to
02:35:28.279 apply commonly to yeah if someone if
02:35:29.760 someone's getting getting slaughtered
02:35:31.319 for promoting a certain exchange go
02:35:33.359 after all the newspapers that also did
02:35:35.160 the same yeah you know agree why why
02:35:37.520 aren't you doing that apply the rules to
02:35:38.800 everyone yeah agreed you you're making a
02:35:42.040 fair point so you make $20,000 a month
02:35:45.240 from YouTube you can make there are
02:35:47.120 months that are better there are months
02:35:48.439 that are worse and from Brands you
02:35:50.000 probably make yeah I think the upward
02:35:51.520 cap is it's it's possible if you have a
02:35:54.160 more than 10 million across different
02:35:55.479 social media profiles you can uh I have
02:35:58.640 so you can make you can make upwards of
02:36:00.399 a million dollars a year the market can
02:36:02.680 can price you dynamically yeah you are
02:36:05.040 worth what the person who's willing to
02:36:06.800 pay you that's what outside of the fact
02:36:09.840 that you're my friend and I'll say good
02:36:11.240 things I think your ads are the ads that
02:36:15.279 I remember yeah in many many years thank
02:36:18.439 you appreciate that after a really long
02:36:20.279 time if we have ads that have the recall
02:36:22.479 value that used to have of the all of
02:36:24.359 all the iconic ads that we studied in
02:36:26.279 bmm it's yours bmm yeah because we had
02:36:29.760 advertising and we would have these case
02:36:31.279 studies that we would study about Pepsi
02:36:32.840 and Coke and
02:36:33.880 everyone bachelor in stud ficol all
02:36:37.880 those campaigns we used to study like so
02:36:40.359 the the agency that I run it's it's
02:36:42.120 called Moon there are a couple of
02:36:43.160 agencies that I'm that I'm a part of the
02:36:44.960 one that specifically does television
02:36:46.720 commercial it's called moonshot i' I'm
02:36:48.600 very lucky that I've had collaborators
02:36:50.960 over the years who have decided to make
02:36:52.760 my co-founder this by the way is a is
02:36:55.080 something that I recommend to every
02:36:56.240 influencer right especially those who
02:36:57.720 are you know who have who have large
02:36:59.200 distributions so I was very lucky that
02:37:01.479 uh I had a lot of collaborators in the
02:37:03.200 past who you know after uh you know
02:37:05.920 after a few years they started their own
02:37:07.319 business some of whom I invested in and
02:37:09.720 I became a co-founder in in one agency
02:37:12.720 and some that I started with like moon
02:37:14.960 is with DEA that's where write
02:37:16.240 television commercials I actually
02:37:17.840 recommend a lot of um you know digital
02:37:20.840 creators to find co-founders to team up
02:37:23.960 with because the biggest leverage that
02:37:25.560 you have is distribution right so if you
02:37:28.240 focus on the that you're really
02:37:29.560 good at uh you can offload a bunch of
02:37:31.800 other stuff on other co-founders it
02:37:33.520 becomes easier for most digital creators
02:37:36.080 to punt on a business or try a new
02:37:37.920 business if there's someone else who can
02:37:39.359 who you can do it with but if you're
02:37:40.880 alone it becomes very hard to run
02:37:42.399 multiple businesses because running your
02:37:44.399 own distribution channel is is also a
02:37:46.359 full-time job it's it's it's hard enough
02:37:48.200 to do that it's tough for you to think
02:37:50.120 that I'm going to continue building this
02:37:51.479 distribution and I'm going to launch a
02:37:52.760 fashion line and I'm going to do this it
02:37:54.120 becomes hard so want to make it easy for
02:37:56.359 people watching this okay there's three
02:37:57.840 Avenues you can take and you see a lot
02:37:59.399 of us are taking different Avenues one
02:38:00.880 you can say I am a Creator I'm a
02:38:02.600 successful Creator uh my next step is I
02:38:05.120 want to build my own business and
02:38:06.520 control my own business then do by
02:38:08.120 myself right that's like that's Nas
02:38:09.840 daily Nas company everything I'm doing
02:38:11.920 is like building an entrepreneur
02:38:13.720 building my own stock basically another
02:38:15.800 thing is say I have distribution I love
02:38:17.880 being a Creator and I want to partner
02:38:19.560 with others and I want to build five
02:38:21.399 businesses and I be a co-founder with
02:38:22.880 other people and so that's your the path
02:38:24.680 that you've taken another one says
02:38:26.240 actually I want to continue to build a
02:38:28.479 business out of my my talent and my
02:38:31.399 creativity and create more content and
02:38:34.279 and and what that's what you're doing
02:38:35.720 writing a book creating TV show and all
02:38:38.319 that stuff so you continue building you
02:38:40.200 are the business right here is your
02:38:42.319 co-founders are the business here is me
02:38:44.640 and my team are the business right right
02:38:46.160 but each way is valid yeah there's no
02:38:48.960 right or wrong it's forward there's no
02:38:50.240 right or wrong but one you are a
02:38:51.560 combination of the three but I don't
02:38:53.200 know he is he he he's doing a bunch of
02:38:55.120 these but one thing I can assure you
02:38:56.640 right you want to build a business under
02:38:59.040 your distribution no matter what because
02:39:01.479 wealth is made through owning through
02:39:03.319 owning equity and not through renting
02:39:04.880 your time out and unfortunately the
02:39:06.720 Branded content part of our business
02:39:08.640 it's B it's effectively high rent corre
02:39:10.920 so you definitely want to do it and I
02:39:12.439 recommend creators who you know you
02:39:14.000 spend the first 3 four years really
02:39:15.279 growing really enjoying that but the
02:39:17.200 second you start feeling like maybe
02:39:18.560 there's a ceiling start thinking about
02:39:20.080 start think about a business immediately
02:39:21.880 in fact I would't even wait for the
02:39:23.160 second you start feeling like there's a
02:39:24.399 cap to it you want to start doing it
02:39:26.120 before and the way to think about it is
02:39:27.640 your main sources of income are going to
02:39:28.880 be brands that pay you you got to
02:39:30.439 immediately think what are my sources
02:39:32.160 number two three 4 how else am I going
02:39:34.560 to make money and you got to try
02:39:36.240 everything you want to try affiliate you
02:39:38.439 want to try branded content you want to
02:39:39.960 try building your own business you want
02:39:40.960 to try consultancy you want to try
02:39:42.439 selling merch you got to try all of it
02:39:44.399 cuz you don't know what stickes and what
02:39:45.680 audience will buy do you know what you
02:39:46.960 invested in in my company so your money
02:39:49.600 I'm using we're building this platform
02:39:51.439 that you've invested in okay I know Nas
02:39:53.880 nasio so Nas doio platform is basically
02:39:56.760 saying okay in the future Brands will
02:39:59.640 not be your friends Community will be so
02:40:01.720 nasio basically helps you take your
02:40:03.760 community and turn it into a business
02:40:06.080 that's what is really important helps
02:40:07.720 you sell those digital courses helps you
02:40:10.000 create a membership helps you make so
02:40:12.080 we're seeing hundreds of people making
02:40:14.000 tens of thousands of dollars on niio
02:40:15.880 from their community and that is the
02:40:18.800 future of business building it's in the
02:40:21.319 past 20 years ago I want to start a
02:40:23.720 business on the internet I build the
02:40:25.600 product I use Shopify and I sell the
02:40:28.040 business through marketing today is I
02:40:31.640 create content I get a community I sell
02:40:34.800 I find a product for this community it's
02:40:37.359 a whole new way of making money and so
02:40:40.840 that's what nasayo is designed for and I
02:40:42.960 think that's what a lot of creators will
02:40:44.600 build businesses around I agree with him
02:40:46.359 nice plug I was about to say
02:40:49.760 that good good good sell I feel like one
02:40:53.479 thing that nasara does so well is really
02:40:58.560 sell himself and I feel like as no and I
02:41:01.160 mean that in a very good way I'm so bad
02:41:03.000 at it no I think the fact that you doing
02:41:05.240 it again dude by repetition and that's
02:41:08.359 what I learned as a creator that
02:41:10.720 sometimes you don't you have to be your
02:41:13.200 loudest cheerleader you have to scream
02:41:16.359 your like your own
02:41:17.960 post shut up double tap on your own
02:41:20.640 pictures I'm saying you have to tell the
02:41:23.319 world what you're doing and exactly how
02:41:25.319 you're doing you have to have a clear
02:41:26.560 message as well yeah you got to you got
02:41:29.439 to know your brand what's the brand
02:41:30.920 that's sing and you have to keep
02:41:32.560 repeating it because what is yours oh
02:41:35.520 like And
02:41:38.000 subscribe what is your brand that you
02:41:40.040 keep screaming or that you think is a
02:41:42.319 good idea to so I feel like as a Creator
02:41:44.600 it never really stops no matter how many
02:41:46.600 numbers you get no matter how famous you
02:41:48.200 get no matter how much impact you get it
02:41:50.479 never stops you have to constantly keep
02:41:53.000 pushing whatever little small what
02:41:55.359 whatever it is a tiny thing you did it's
02:41:57.439 a tiny and that could go with Brands as
02:41:59.160 well one thing to kind of also retain
02:42:01.600 Brands and have longer relationships
02:42:03.200 with them is to subtly overd
02:42:06.760 deliver yeah oh yeah this a great tip
02:42:09.880 yeah always certainly don't don't don't
02:42:12.319 make it look like a ban and everything
02:42:14.760 you say will say
02:42:15.960 but slightly I've promised you three
02:42:18.279 stories I'll give you five because you
02:42:20.600 know this is something a lot of creators
02:42:21.760 are really bad at you know they look at
02:42:23.520 they look at the transaction with the
02:42:25.040 brand as hey you paid me this much this
02:42:27.399 what you get right but really at the end
02:42:29.520 of the day it's people people at the
02:42:31.560 other end who are trying to have a
02:42:33.479 relationship with you and if you truly
02:42:35.080 go out of a way to build that it really
02:42:37.359 pays off cuz you know brand manag very
02:42:40.040 useful tip right yeah it's super useful
02:42:42.399 and a lot of people think that you know
02:42:44.720 U lot of people like hey I won't work
02:42:46.279 unless these these these these things
02:42:47.439 are required but you won't realize you
02:42:49.200 know you it happens with me where I love
02:42:51.080 talking to Brand managers I love it I
02:42:53.040 love spending time with them really
02:42:54.399 understanding what want a lot of times
02:42:55.359 conversations gets easier when you do it
02:42:56.840 right way easier cuz there's no five
02:42:58.160 Middle Men A lot of people like having a
02:43:00.200 manager between you and what is a brand
02:43:02.319 manager like say Adidas yeah so Adidas
02:43:05.640 has a brand so Adidas will have a main
02:43:07.920 brand manager then they might have like
02:43:09.520 a person who runs deploys their
02:43:11.279 influencer marketing capital and then
02:43:13.680 they sometimes have an agency they we
02:43:15.560 have an agency you want to but these
02:43:17.279 guys have favorites they have favorite
02:43:18.640 creators correct and so you want to be
02:43:19.800 their favorite you want to be their
02:43:20.880 favorite uh like they literally decide
02:43:23.319 on where to deploy dollars based on
02:43:24.760 their timeline so you're saying favorite
02:43:26.200 is not necessarily traction but also how
02:43:29.279 Rel relationship fully the way it works
02:43:31.680 with Brands is three ways one night
02:43:33.760 stands dating or marriage yeah one night
02:43:37.000 stand is give me money I'll give you a
02:43:38.960 service bye-bye by and they never come
02:43:40.960 back again dating is let's make 10
02:43:42.840 videos in 10 months together marriage is
02:43:45.080 I'm your brand ambassador yeah you want
02:43:47.240 marriage you want marriage you you want
02:43:49.160 marriage with everyone and that's also
02:43:50.560 the most effective R
02:43:53.840 sorry that is also the most effective
02:43:56.600 kind of uh translation that will happen
02:43:58.680 of a relationship with a brand I've I've
02:44:01.399 found out that when you do longer
02:44:03.760 associations it also benefits you as a
02:44:05.720 Creator and to your credibility for sure
02:44:08.040 because I will see creators who will
02:44:09.960 speak about three brands in the same
02:44:13.080 sector in a span of one month M yeah and
02:44:16.160 that immediately takes their credibility
02:44:17.720 away from them like but AB you said that
02:44:20.160 that one was the best face wash now
02:44:22.040 you're saying it's this one so like
02:44:23.520 which one do I but if I sell the same
02:44:25.240 face wash for 3
02:44:27.319 years that brings my credibility up for
02:44:29.720 other brand products do you would you
02:44:31.760 also only sell what you like or would
02:44:33.960 you sell
02:44:35.520 Hoopes most creators would sell hoes
02:44:38.040 come on let's not me yeah yeah there's
02:44:40.800 there's a number for most creators but
02:44:42.279 there's some like obvious category
02:44:43.800 blocks like you want to avoid betting
02:44:45.600 and you aoid you want to avoid some
02:44:47.120 stuff fness scams and that that do you
02:44:49.439 think do you think this also become more
02:44:52.000 relevant because people have lost faith
02:44:54.640 in Bollywood and Cricket because they
02:44:55.960 sold everything for so long so people
02:44:58.319 don't buy from them anymore I think it's
02:45:00.080 because the cricket player doesn't tell
02:45:01.279 a story The Cricket player just wears a
02:45:02.840 T-shirt and smiles N I don't think it's
02:45:04.960 about them using the product in the
02:45:06.240 first case it's all about legitimacy if
02:45:09.359 I see a brand with shauk I'm not
02:45:11.120 thinking shauk uses this I'm thinking
02:45:13.160 this brand can afford shauk they're not
02:45:14.800 going any but when you see pra using it
02:45:17.120 do you think she uses it yeah I think
02:45:18.720 even in the Creator segment you know
02:45:20.560 some creators are uh you know more
02:45:22.840 either add more legitimacy or they know
02:45:25.600 that this Creator is really big so this
02:45:27.040 must have been expensive to to buy this
02:45:28.800 slot so it's it's spending power of a
02:45:31.279 brand determines trust and trust and
02:45:33.600 legitimacy what is Shah ruk doing
02:45:35.520 right oo so many things see again he's a
02:45:39.160 biggest fan who shuk he's his biggest
02:45:42.200 fan yeah he is pushing everything he's
02:45:44.920 doing doing and he is not being humble
02:45:46.800 about it he is he's there he's like I am
02:45:49.720 good and I'm doing this and that is and
02:45:51.359 I feel like that is what I love about
02:45:53.319 and that's what I want to learn from
02:45:54.240 this is something that shuk has said
02:45:55.479 before which is his relationship with
02:45:57.279 Brands um I think it was Hyundai that he
02:45:59.920 spoke about saying that hyai did not he
02:46:01.760 used those cards like visibly he visibly
02:46:04.040 used those cards and he went out of his
02:46:05.840 way and he had a very long partnership
02:46:08.120 with them like he launched it with them
02:46:09.920 and he has publicly said that there are
02:46:11.479 you know Brands like Hyundai supported
02:46:13.080 him even during the bad times look it's
02:46:15.439 you forget at the end of the day most of
02:46:17.160 these industries are really small the
02:46:18.240 same people work in like 10 15 different
02:46:20.080 brands right like very rarely do do
02:46:23.359 people just stick around with one place
02:46:24.920 for 20 years people move around this is
02:46:27.399 so rare that creators develop
02:46:29.640 relationship with brand managers it's
02:46:31.200 very rare yeah some of it is because you
02:46:33.720 know agencies in the middle are very
02:46:35.240 scared that if a Creator talks to a
02:46:36.720 client directly they going to miss their
02:46:38.600 brokerage they'll know how much
02:46:39.920 brokerage is G they know how much
02:46:40.920 brokerage is gone that kind of thing
02:46:42.840 this is why I push creators to talk to
02:46:44.479 the brand guys
02:46:46.880 don't put all your eggs into one manager
02:46:49.840 because your manager may not have your
02:46:51.240 best interest in mind I've never had a
02:46:52.880 manager in my entire life nothing wrong
02:46:55.359 with having a manager I know you have a
02:46:56.520 manager you have a manager nothing wrong
02:46:58.200 with that but be careful because when I
02:47:00.520 am a brand and I give creators money if
02:47:03.080 a manager comes to me and be like you
02:47:05.439 can't talk to my client and my client
02:47:06.680 doesn't do anything for less than
02:47:07.479 $10,000 I give them the middle finger
02:47:09.319 and I move the on so you don't want
02:47:11.560 to that guy yeah vage is your manager UL
02:47:15.000 my
02:47:15.640 co-founder yeah you it's important to
02:47:17.920 get your manager's incentives aligned
02:47:19.399 with you yeah that's some things you
02:47:21.319 want to do for free but your manager
02:47:23.160 doesn't make any money on it because
02:47:24.640 they take a commission but it's good for
02:47:26.359 your branding like going to Davos yeah
02:47:28.279 Davos doesn't pay but it's important
02:47:30.479 that we go to Davos to increase a brand
02:47:32.279 so the manager's incentive is only to
02:47:34.399 work on brands that make money so that's
02:47:37.080 where the problems start to happen yeah
02:47:38.760 but these These are the top of the pile
02:47:40.560 right you guys are top of the pyramid
02:47:42.920 that's true I I would call it survivors
02:47:44.560 we surv survivals it's a survival game
02:47:46.800 it's not like about there's likes in
02:47:52.000 victimhood made it
02:47:54.319 through when do you start making
02:47:57.279 money meaningful money or any money any
02:47:59.800 money I think within like two months
02:48:02.120 yeah I actually didn't make any money
02:48:04.800 for like almost a year wow yeah I made
02:48:08.439 $200 after two months if you I think if
02:48:11.600 you if you start getting upwards of you
02:48:14.560 know 50,000 views on YouTube you can you
02:48:17.640 and if you get that regularly YouTube
02:48:19.279 will start paying you how much will they
02:48:20.960 pay you let's say you put out four
02:48:22.560 videos in a month which get one gets 50
02:48:26.000 another gets 10 another gets five I had
02:48:28.840 then you make nothing 55 10 and all you
02:48:30.520 make nothing yeah no no yeah that is why
02:48:33.640 it took me that long you want to make I
02:48:36.040 think you want to make at least you want
02:48:37.640 to get at least 100,000 views Plus for
02:48:40.439 you to make a few thousand rupees on on
02:48:43.279 YouTube in India wow this is why I get
02:48:45.479 back to the same point on YouTube you
02:48:47.720 need a million people to make $100 in a
02:48:50.200 community you need a hundred people to
02:48:52.200 make $1,000 in a community each one of
02:48:54.600 your members will pay you $10 that $10
02:48:56.880 time $100 is $1,000 your community is
02:48:58.960 where you make the money not from the
02:49:00.160 brands and not from YouTube any hint
02:49:02.319 hack on building that Community yes own
02:49:05.479 the audience how it's so important my
02:49:09.279 biggest mistake was for seven years I

02:49:36.160 their phone number great now I can reach
02:49:38.560 those people for the next 10 years while
02:49:41.239 I can never reach them again on YouTube
02:49:43.359 so now it's in the platforms interest to
02:49:45.120 not let you own the audience they never
02:49:46.399 let you so now I have 20,000 people I
02:49:48.000 email them I email them using Nas
02:49:50.040 subscriber subscriber audience sub
02:49:52.840 here's the interesting part on YouTube
02:49:54.399 if someone subscribe to subscribes to
02:49:55.920 you you don't get any details about them
02:49:57.760 like do you have an audience whose
02:49:59.080 number email I have 400,000 now I don't
02:50:01.600 have that you need to start building
02:50:03.640 that I have a mind performance app so
02:50:06.040 they go there they use the app yeah I
02:50:08.680 don't have that either you need that too
02:50:11.160 I need I need that very badly I wish
02:50:13.000 somebody told me this when I started I
02:50:14.800 would have 5 million numbers now but I
02:50:16.560 only have 400,000 but 80% of my Revenue
02:50:19.560 now comes from these 400,000 emails may
02:50:22.200 maybe I mean correct me if I'm wrong I
02:50:24.880 the way I look at it is if you're
02:50:26.439 getting the numbers and names uh and
02:50:28.520 also giving them some utility in return
02:50:30.960 it's much more long-term and Powerful
02:50:33.399 yes and I I think that's how young
02:50:36.239 content creators should look at it yeah
02:50:37.800 that's what it means to build a
02:50:38.760 community off of social media no I'm not
02:50:41.000 not talking about but generally I think
02:50:42.439 a lot of people just send out
02:50:44.800 newsletters and all I don't know how
02:50:46.640 effective newsletters are anymore and I
02:50:47.880 might be entirely wrong oh very
02:50:49.120 effective like my ex-girlfriend alen
02:50:52.160 right she has let's say 300,000
02:50:53.640 followers on on I'll give you the number
02:50:55.040 because she's off public about her
02:50:56.200 numbers 300,000 followers on Instagram
02:50:58.319 she's like any time join my newsletter
02:51:00.359 join my newsletter okay uh so naso helps
02:51:02.960 you do that so join my newsletter uh
02:51:05.800 in was designed for that so so so now
02:51:09.120 she has I think 10,000 emails of girls
02:51:11.560 interested in Retreats each product is
02:51:13.640 $3,000 wow $4,000 now she3 million of
02:51:17.160 potential Revenue yes so she makes for
02:51:19.680 $500,000 a year from that $10,000
02:51:22.800 mailing list selling Retreats wow and
02:51:25.640 she makes Zero from Instagram that's
02:51:28.439 where the real money is then yes yeah in
02:51:30.920 owning your audience yes I agree do you
02:51:33.920 feel any difference any different about
02:51:35.840 the Indian audiences and how they
02:51:37.800 respond to these things no I think it's
02:51:39.880 it's possible to get get the data I
02:51:41.840 think that's very possible you just need
02:51:44.080 the right character at the end of it
02:51:45.479 yeah I also think that Indian audience
02:51:47.479 arpu is lower but I think that if you
02:51:49.840 find the right product you're able to
02:51:51.399 monetize them like it's it's possible to
02:51:53.479 do uh it's just whether me and you can
02:51:56.239 do it depends really depend on the
02:51:57.600 product it's possible to do it what's a
02:52:00.000 really successful
02:52:01.920 Indian content creator Le product
02:52:04.120 Finance with Sharon Finance with Sharon
02:52:06.399 Sharon's done it really well I think a
02:52:08.520 lot of the guys who do courses are able
02:52:10.359 to monetize very easily because OPM
02:52:12.479 right which is oh you think that doing X
02:52:14.920 is going to help you do way better
02:52:17.359 products are harder to move because
02:52:19.880 physical products you mean yeah physical
02:52:21.600 products are harder to move like I know
02:52:22.840 Bollywood movie stars have launched
02:52:24.080 products and they most of them are tank
02:52:25.600 there are very few hits like it has to
02:52:27.439 be the right and Perfect Fit Rik and hrx
02:52:29.760 was was perfect that's why I recommend
02:52:31.760 experiences not a lot of creators are
02:52:33.279 doing that yeah experiences dance
02:52:34.960 creators are doing that no yeah like
02:52:36.520 learn dancing learn Dancing Yeah like
02:52:38.920 Nicole and um sonal are doing that yeah
02:52:42.399 yeah you can you can build a bunch of
02:52:43.640 service businesses
02:52:45.640 easily take your audience with you to
02:52:47.800 the himal for a sday Meditation Retreat
02:52:50.560 I would do it with you you're the guru
02:52:52.080 on the stuff how to be more connected
02:52:54.160 with yourself I mean I would do it with
02:52:55.800 you will will YouTube go after you when
02:52:58.200 you do that no it will not patreon is A5
02:53:01.000 billion company and that's the whole
02:53:02.600 idea of it they upload videos early
02:53:05.000 right what does patreon do patreon is a
02:53:08.120 different platform where you can pay a
02:53:09.880 Creator a certain fee to get certain
02:53:11.680 privileges memberships but basically you
02:53:14.080 take the data I mean taking the data
02:53:16.040 from YouTube it's fair and square if
02:53:18.160 you're doing it like inside the video
02:53:19.960 content if you put a link and people
02:53:21.479 click on it it's fair and square does
02:53:23.520 YouTube downgrade you if you're
02:53:25.319 monetizing versus being free no does it
02:53:28.840 upgrade you if you're monetizing no they
02:53:31.080 don't care I mean it's good for them if
02:53:32.800 you're monetizing because they are also
02:53:34.000 monetizing them YouTube takes 55% of AD
02:53:37.080 revenue and 30% of membership Revenue
02:53:41.560 okay so the last
02:53:43.359 section the penultimate section is how
02:53:47.680 to damn the last section of this
02:53:51.479 section just between us like we want to
02:53:54.200 cover the entire breadth of what a young
02:53:58.479 person wanting to build a following
02:54:00.920 needs what do you think we've missed
02:54:02.920 nothing see you next time any tools any
02:54:07.319 like hacks do you use CH GPD mid Journey
02:54:10.720 all of that is useful um all the AI
02:54:13.399 tools will be use rate in order of
02:54:15.720 useful the top three GPD is very useful
02:54:18.359 for um everything and everything
02:54:21.680 ideation writing like scripts are now
02:54:24.479 automated yeah uh we're going to have
02:54:26.760 oneclick llm training very soon it's
02:54:29.800 already out there it's just not Mega
02:54:31.399 simplified so what is llm training large
02:54:33.479 language model training which means you
02:54:34.960 can take potentially all the scripts
02:54:36.640 you've ever written in your voice feed
02:54:38.920 it into a large language model and it
02:54:40.399 can start spitting out content in your
02:54:42.720 style like it's doable like people have
02:54:44.520 already done it with comedians like
02:54:45.600 they've taken scripts of you know Bill
02:54:47.279 Hicks George khin and said what would
02:54:48.880 George khin say about why and if you
02:54:51.239 have enough data to train the llm this
02:54:53.200 is possible to do and it will be
02:54:54.680 eventually very very easy to do um
02:54:57.000 dubbing tools all just keep an eye out
02:54:59.120 on the AI stuff follow over powered um
02:55:01.640 that that's super helpful GPD is super
02:55:03.359 super useful all things content creation
02:55:05.160 it can help you ideate think of titles
02:55:07.399 uh what should be the thumbnail
02:55:09.319 everything right writing the full script
02:55:10.720 all that is useful one hack that I would
02:55:12.439 recommend is if you know how to Ed it
02:55:15.120 it's super useful yeah if you know what
02:55:17.640 how the end product is made after you're
02:55:19.680 done shooting it is very useful cuz
02:55:22.239 it'll start changing the way you
02:55:23.600 actually even start thinking about yeah
02:55:26.000 but will your editing quality be as good
02:55:28.359 as a professional in time if you edit
02:55:31.279 enough yeah I would say if you if you
02:55:33.640 can edit a short form video with
02:55:35.560 captions Cuts other footage you're
02:55:37.920 learning a lot in in a very quick time
02:55:40.560 yeah but actually my biggest
02:55:42.040 recommendation to people is your first
02:55:43.640 hire should be an editor if you can
02:55:45.920 afford to hire anybody hire an editor
02:55:47.600 because that's how you buy back your
02:55:48.880 time so when I was making the daily
02:55:50.040 videos I made the first 750 videos
02:55:52.520 myself it was taking me five hours of
02:55:54.399 editing every single day when I hired
02:55:56.560 that person it freed me five hours a day
02:55:58.439 to do everything else build a business
02:56:01.319 get an editor if if you have really
02:56:03.399 talented team members like if your
02:56:05.080 editor is really good people are going
02:56:06.840 to try and post this editor immediately
02:56:09.080 people are literally going to try and
02:56:10.359 copy post do all that so one thing
02:56:12.319 that's really helped me is I have a
02:56:13.359 small team of five folks who've been
02:56:14.760 with me for the last 3 four years and
02:56:16.000 you hide them huh you hide them in and
02:56:17.920 hide them they get credited in every
02:56:19.520 video their names and Instagram IDs are
02:56:21.560 public uh but one thing that I did is
02:56:23.880 every time I do like a every time I do
02:56:26.760 like a sponsored thing everybody
02:56:28.680 involved in the video uh gets a gets a
02:56:31.040 piece of it uh so the editor gets paid
02:56:33.439 editor gets paid bonus on on a sponsored
02:56:35.239 video the cast members get get a get a
02:56:37.200 piece of this thing right from Shankar
02:56:39.319 to the editors to the cast members
02:56:40.560 everybody gets a piece of the sponsored
02:56:42.160 cont that comes in because it's just you
02:56:44.680 know the the vibe of the room changes
02:56:47.120 when I say there's a sponsored video cuz
02:56:48.880 everybody who's working on it feels like
02:56:50.439 all right good Payday for me um so a
02:56:53.720 good idea I recommend that I would
02:56:55.399 highly recommend it cuz I know my guys
02:56:58.040 like you know they months that I have
02:57:00.640 had a great month they've had a great
02:57:02.600 month too months where I've had an okay
02:57:04.600 month they've had an okay month I feel
02:57:05.880 like that's what I mean when I say that
02:57:07.520 collaboration is so important when you
02:57:09.160 become a creator that eventually you are
02:57:10.760 going to have to make your band of
02:57:12.880 people who believe in your content and
02:57:15.160 want to cont want to contribute to it as
02:57:17.279 much as you do most of the content
02:57:18.800 creators who went mainstream and then
02:57:20.279 faded away often it was an outcome of
02:57:23.080 the teams leaving them I've noticed this
02:57:24.960 a lot and most people don't do this I
02:57:27.120 I've I say this a lot to other creators
02:57:28.960 and everyone's always like oh oh you do
02:57:30.760 that I'm like yeah we do we do this but
02:57:32.600 we do 7% profit share so every month 7%
02:57:35.600 of the profit goes back to the team as a
02:57:36.800 bonus yeah it gets tricky when the the
02:57:39.560 team is too big because you don't want
02:57:40.680 the editor to make the most money and
02:57:42.080 the executive assistant not to make any
02:57:43.760 money yeah correct correct so you want
02:57:45.160 to make sure the whole team get get it
02:57:48.239 it's very easy when it's just small team
02:57:51.000 and if somebody watching this if you
02:57:52.399 don't want to be a Creator and you say
02:57:53.880 oh my face is not designed for this my
02:57:55.640 personality I'm too shy for this right
02:57:57.560 then become an editor for every one of
02:57:59.680 us we have created together 200 300 jobs
02:58:04.040 right so there's 200 Creator economy
02:58:06.200 jobs from four channels so you can be an
02:58:09.120 editor you can be an executive assistant
02:58:10.760 you can be a producer you can be a
02:58:12.120 script writer there's many jobs the
02:58:14.080 creat economy if you're still watching
02:58:15.720 until the end of this video it really
02:58:17.680 means you should apply for one of these
02:58:19.200 jobs does how you look what you wear
02:58:23.319 matter makeup no makeup how you look
02:58:26.600 what t-shirt you're wearing what dress
02:58:28.479 you're wearing I mean nire wears the
02:58:30.680 same thing every day every single day
02:58:32.800 depends if you're a guy or girl to be
02:58:33.960 honest yeah depends if you're a guy or
02:58:35.520 girl looks matter a lot for women but
02:58:37.319 you know I remember when I started off
02:58:41.479 uh on YouTube and I started uploading
02:58:43.239 content
02:58:45.600 it was oh if you're going on camera you
02:58:47.319 have to put makeup on if I'm shooting a
02:58:49.399 video I have to put makeup on I have to
02:58:51.200 dress a certain way I have to speak a
02:58:52.760 certain way and then I think three or
02:58:56.680 four weeks into making making my videos
02:58:59.399 I did one video where I sat down in my
02:59:01.520 pajamas and I wasn't wearing any makeup
02:59:03.279 and my hair wasn't real talk Tuesday
02:59:04.880 Real Talk Tuesday my first Real Talk
02:59:06.279 Tuesday video I was replying to hate
02:59:08.800 comments and all the comments under were
02:59:11.600 oh my God you really it's so nice to see
02:59:13.960 you like this because you're more
02:59:15.680 relatable like that and ever since then
02:59:18.479 my idea of associating the way I look to
02:59:22.920 what I do has really changed and that
02:59:25.239 only happened because I put myself out
02:59:26.560 on the internet so it can work either
02:59:28.239 ways wow p is pretty like real that way
02:59:32.040 like she's sweating and working out and
02:59:34.000 she's like and that's why people love
02:59:35.239 you cuz you're very relatable Rel yeah
02:59:37.439 but and I've also had a time where I
02:59:39.840 went on a because I felt that pressure
02:59:41.760 at one point and I was like everybody's
02:59:43.479 posting such nice pictures maybe I
02:59:45.040 should get styled and you know I should
02:59:46.399 also do like hair and makeup all the
02:59:48.040 time and all the pictures have to be SLR
02:59:49.560 pictures and I put them out and the
02:59:51.920 first picture did really well and then
02:59:53.279 the second dipped and then the third
02:59:55.080 dipped and the fourth dipped and then I
02:59:56.200 put out a selfie of me eating Chinese at
02:59:58.800 the yashraj galii and that one shot up
03:00:01.479 and that's when I realized that you know
03:00:02.720 what it's different for everyone and I'm
03:00:05.800 so happy that I'm in a position where I
03:00:08.120 can
03:00:09.640 dink the two things very cool so it
03:00:12.880 really depends on how you
03:00:14.840 approach it and what precedent you want
03:00:17.040 to set with it female influencers have
03:00:19.040 it rough like there a headcount that
03:00:21.560 comes with the pressure of always
03:00:22.960 looking good is like yeah yeah and the
03:00:25.560 comment section yeah and the comment
03:00:27.279 section how much money does it cost to
03:00:28.920 produce videos when you're beginning
03:00:31.520 depend on the kind of videos Niki you
03:00:32.920 have should be zero yeah just your time
03:00:35.840 so okay last last
03:00:38.080 question we we told people we we tried
03:00:41.760 to teach people how to become an
03:00:43.239 influencer answer how the monetization
03:00:45.560 world Works last question how to stay
03:00:49.160 relevant how to continue to get traction
03:00:52.040 and grow once you have become an
03:00:53.920 influencer keep Reinventing have some
03:00:56.880 form
03:00:58.359 broad keep some form of reinvention
03:01:01.040 going every 6 months for example either
03:01:04.000 you think of switching genres I'm just
03:01:05.920 telling you based on what's worked for
03:01:07.040 me or in the product that you're
03:01:09.000 creating which for me in this case is
03:01:10.319 the podcast you have to bring something
03:01:12.479 new some new J ra uh if you're
03:01:14.920 constantly bringing one narrative bring
03:01:16.239 the opposite narrative you have to serve
03:01:18.680 novelty and personally um I feel the
03:01:22.319 core of this is in your real life as a
03:01:24.200 human you have to keep evolving either
03:01:26.600 find new friend Groups travel more um
03:01:29.319 learn a new skill you have to do new
03:01:31.439  because the content at the end of
03:01:33.840 the day is coming out of your heart so
03:01:35.680 that's the core at least that's what
03:01:37.120 work for me to break it down into a
03:01:39.040 really tiny piece listen to your
03:01:41.880 audience your audience that's the good
03:01:44.399 thing about putting yourself on the
03:01:45.560 internet they are extremely honest
03:01:48.200 nothing will humble you yeah nothing
03:01:50.359 will humble you like your audience if
03:01:52.880 it's working they're going to shout it
03:01:54.960 and they're going to tell you that it's
03:01:56.040 working the minute it stops working
03:01:58.000 they're going to shout that also how
03:01:59.720 does it sound when it stops working oh
03:02:01.680 my
03:02:02.800 God uh videos are not fun anymore we
03:02:06.399 used to like the kind of videos used to
03:02:07.760 make before go back to doing that this
03:02:09.840 is not working they it's very blatant
03:02:11.920 you won't have to sit and decipher it's
03:02:14.239 in the words it's written that many
03:02:15.680 words to you and these are people and I
03:02:17.880 I look forward to this because this is
03:02:19.359 the community that has held me through
03:02:21.600 all the new things that I said the Kali
03:02:23.239 Pula that he was talking about it was a
03:02:25.200 short film that was so away from the
03:02:27.319 content that I'd ever made I I was very
03:02:30.040 scared but I couldn't have the guts to
03:02:33.000 make it if I didn't have the uh
03:02:35.479 confidence that my audience will tell me
03:02:37.359 the truths whether it works or not also
03:02:40.640 yeah if if your engagement goes down
03:02:42.080 that's also a metric of people AR liking
03:02:43.880 this yeah your relevance just so it's
03:02:46.319 very easy actually to keep a reality
03:02:48.399 check on how well your content is doing
03:02:49.960 or how relevant you are based on what
03:02:51.720 your audience is telling you I like to
03:02:53.960 think of it as spikes and waves which is
03:02:58.279 if you want to be all the consistent
03:03:00.680 stuff that you keep putting out those
03:03:02.439 are waves and you got to keep thinking
03:03:03.920 about what's your next Spike these what
03:03:06.800 this means is you're forced to
03:03:08.319 experiment or you're forced to do
03:03:09.800 something that's going to get the next
03:03:11.439 new unique users on onto your platform
03:03:14.680 so if you live to make videos if your
03:03:17.640 number one goal of living is to make the
03:03:19.640 videos it's unsustainable because at
03:03:21.760 some point you'll be so tired of this
03:03:23.800 you don't want to make another cooking
03:03:25.120 video you don't want to make another
03:03:26.239 travel video you're done that's why my
03:03:28.680 number one advice to stay relevant is to
03:03:31.040 live your best life keep living a very
03:03:34.840 interesting life and make videos about
03:03:37.200 that life instead of living life to make
03:03:39.200 videos live an interesting life and take
03:03:41.120 the audience with more so for example
03:03:43.279 when I was traveling the world the
03:03:44.439 audience came with me now I'm building a
03:03:46.439 company the audience must come with me
03:03:48.479 some will don't want to stay behind but
03:03:50.600 this is where I'm going and the audience
03:03:52.319 must come with me because there's no
03:03:54.040 option because I ain't going back to the
03:03:55.200 old days right and then when I do the my
03:03:57.239 next my third act the audience will have
03:03:59.000 to come the audience love to see a hero
03:04:01.399 fall and a hero succeed they love to see
03:04:03.720 a hero like go up so the most
03:04:05.520 interesting thing about Nas da is where
03:04:07.840 is it going to go next because you don't
03:04:09.800 know that so don't live to make videos
03:04:12.840 live interesting life and make videos
03:04:15.000 about it smart makes a lot of sense okay
03:04:18.800 guys at the end of every episode we try
03:04:21.560 and do something to help the community
03:04:23.479 we are teaching on that particular day
03:04:26.239 we hope this is in a manner
03:04:29.040 College uh that many people most people
03:04:32.399 do not have access to uh we looked far
03:04:35.439 and wide online on how to be a
03:04:37.239 influencer we didn't find much but when
03:04:40.120 we asked people this is such a
03:04:42.520 profession that young people want to get
03:04:44.359 into now uh what for me as a kid was
03:04:47.439 being a pilot or an astronaut things I
03:04:49.560 knew about but I said it because it
03:04:51.920 was cool back then today that is being a
03:04:54.840 social media content
03:04:57.160 creator uh so I'd like to request you
