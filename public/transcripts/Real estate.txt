00:00:44.559 ready thank you guys for coming uh I
00:00:48.440 know all three of you fairly well
00:00:50.960 because we live in the same city and we
00:00:52.960 have met many times dozens of times for
00:00:57.199 the people who do not know you uh I
00:00:59.680 don't think there are many of those but
00:01:02.559 maybe we can start with Iran Uncle tell
00:01:05.960 us a bit about growing up in Bangalore
00:01:11.240 and how you came
00:01:13.880 about and became this uh Original
00:01:17.960 Gangster of the real estate
00:01:20.840 industry I like that where did you get
00:01:23.840 that that's I like that I like that I
00:01:28.119 love that
00:01:30.439 you know Nik I never ever thought that
00:01:33.520 I'll be a developer or a real
00:01:38.320 estate professional in whichever
00:01:41.640 way of course Bangalore in our days
00:01:44.680 because I'm
00:01:45.799 ancient was a very very sleepy old city
00:01:49.200 so were you also born in Bangalore yeah
00:01:51.600 I've been born in Bangalore bred in
00:01:53.960 Bangalore parents moved to Bangalore
00:01:56.799 parents my grandparents came in from
00:02:00.560 B that is about more than 100 years ago
00:02:04.280 my parents also were born in Bangalore
00:02:06.880 they studied in s Joseph's I studied in
00:02:09.199 St Joseph's I did my college in the
00:02:11.440 Commerce College in St Joseph's
00:02:13.800 graduated from so this even those days
00:02:16.920 today kids the moment they finish the
00:02:18.879 school the next thing they'll be looking
00:02:20.280 at which you need to go which part of
00:02:21.920 the world they need to go and study we
00:02:24.360 never had such Concepts the only concept
00:02:27.319 was okay after you finish this what what
00:02:30.000 do you do next so you have to graduate
00:02:32.680 you do that and then later on it was for
00:02:34.720 me I I had a passion for numbers I had a
00:02:37.440 passion for law so I did my stint in uh
00:02:41.400 year plus in the law college and then
00:02:44.560 dropped out and I did also an article
00:02:47.440 ship for uh my ched accountant which I
00:02:50.920 again opted out because I got sucked
00:02:52.959 into my parents business so that's what
00:02:56.040 happened and that was fashion men's way
00:02:58.560 fashion I made nira's dad's uh wedding
00:03:02.319 clothes really right she she wouldn't
00:03:04.640 know about it because she she wasn't
00:03:06.680 there so when her dad walked in the
00:03:09.599 whole family see the we used to get all
00:03:11.680 the coffee Planters from different part
00:03:14.680 from this section we used to get the
00:03:17.799 industrialist the businessmen including
00:03:20.799 the the the the where we are sitting Mr
00:03:24.120 Malia himself used to come and make his
00:03:26.640 clothes with us on Commercial Street
00:03:28.840 yeah yeah yeah and of course a lot of
00:03:31.280 VIPs that that's how we have that
00:03:33.439 connect we know all the who's who that
00:03:36.120 made things easy also so why did you
00:03:39.120 think of starting a real estate company
00:03:41.400 from Quirk of Fate
00:03:44.400 Destiny this happened in the year 1980
00:03:48.080 81 we sold a family
00:03:51.280 property so I was maybe as old as
00:03:56.159 current
00:03:57.319 here my parent my dad and my two uncles
00:04:01.480 wanted to sell that they put me and said
00:04:03.560 you now you do the entire
00:04:05.599 transaction so that was way back in
00:04:08.480 18 so they
00:04:11.680 said some Bombay developer wanted to buy
00:04:14.599 it in fact there were several people
00:04:16.959 somebody from Delhi somebody from Bombay
00:04:18.839 finally we chose someone and then that
00:04:21.320 entire process
00:04:23.080 of doing the agreement of sale getting
00:04:26.199 the entire money out from the developer
00:04:30.280 and then again the
00:04:31.639 reinvestment the reinvestment that was
00:04:33.960 what made it all very attractive you see
00:04:36.600 once the money came and of course my two
00:04:38.360 uncles took their share and we had to
00:04:41.639 reinvest for ourselves and did something
00:04:43.680 and that in that quest of selling and
00:04:47.240 buying we got this little bit of taste
00:04:50.880 of real estate where you know we we did
00:04:52.880 some quick profits in some flipping over
00:04:56.000 and what year was this this is 1980 so
00:04:59.280 that is
00:05:00.639 good 44 years ago which which property
00:05:03.639 was the Infantry Crossroad where it's
00:05:05.919 now this called the Blue Cross Chambers
00:05:08.639 that's what that was a family home right
00:05:11.160 so one led to the other the whole thing
00:05:13.440 started as a reinvestment even today you
00:05:15.440 have the same model where you can
00:05:17.520 reinvest and get get the exemption for
00:05:20.800 capital gains so back then also though
00:05:23.120 the tax rate was much higher which is
00:05:25.560 now lower at 12 and a half% people are
00:05:27.600 crying f f has done a disservice by
00:05:30.440 doing it at 12 and A2 I believe whatever
00:05:32.400 she has done is done well without
00:05:34.520 indexing 12 and 1 12% on long-term games
00:05:37.360 is I think uh pretty decent so those
00:05:40.400 days we had to reinvest for my uncle one
00:05:43.600 Uncle of course took his money did
00:05:45.240 whatever we didn't have any say on it
00:05:47.120 between my father and my one Uncle we
00:05:48.880 tried to do all that so in that quest of
00:05:51.680 doing that we came to know about how
00:05:54.240 things went about values were much less
00:05:57.120 all houses were sold for lcks and I
00:05:59.440 bought bought my my first plot for my
00:06:01.560 own house in nand Road at 135 rupees a
00:06:05.039 square foot today it's all thousands
00:06:08.080 people will say 23,500 or 33,500 don't
00:06:11.800 know what the rate is that's how things
00:06:13.919 were back then what defines the value of
00:06:18.240 land Uncle If Today somebody says the
00:06:21.960 value of land let's say on this road is
00:06:24.360 30,000 40,000 per square
00:06:27.039 fet is it the monetization capacity of
00:06:31.680 the land that attributes that value to
00:06:34.520 it see now very different from what it
00:06:38.360 was way back way back it was
00:06:40.639 affordability and how can I uh you know
00:06:43.280 do I can afford that and everything else
00:06:46.120 I know in 1973 my father bought a piece
00:06:49.599 of land in Ali Asar Road cross you know
00:06:52.199 what happened was 7 Element Restaurant
00:06:54.880 yeah see what happened was that time you
00:06:56.400 got the Urban Land ceiling act 76 73 the
00:07:00.440 ACT came in so all the big landlords who
00:07:04.560 had these huge houses they had to
00:07:06.560 quickly dispose of the excess land so
00:07:08.879 they converted them into plots and
00:07:11.879 that's how these layouts came into
00:07:13.520 Bangalore that's the Advent I mean
00:07:15.479 that's a historical thing about layouts
00:07:17.240 in Bangalore now what defines today what
00:07:20.120 it defines is it's depending on what's
00:07:22.639 the selling it's all about FSI on that
00:07:24.960 road it all depends on uh what's the
00:07:27.639 selling price of the product would be
00:07:30.160 and the construction cost so that the
00:07:32.879 entire way of calculating is very
00:07:35.319 different now than back then it it's
00:07:38.560 very different so you did the first land
00:07:41.360 transaction 1980 81 or 82 and then you
00:07:45.280 made some money and then and then one
00:07:48.360 led to the other we did trading in real
00:07:50.919 estate for about 5 years okay then I
00:07:53.720 said this is too boring we must really
00:07:56.080 do something which makes a difference
00:07:58.120 which will be noted for M so I told my
00:08:00.680 brother I said let's do some see there
00:08:02.479 was no good Office Buildings in
00:08:05.080 Bangalore so what ironically I did not
00:08:07.560 do my residential buildings first what
00:08:10.319 we did was we said I felt that office
00:08:14.000 was a nicer way to do it you are more
00:08:17.120 known for it you can either get rental
00:08:19.000 income or you can sell starta offices
00:08:21.759 those days and the office those days
00:08:23.360 were very different from offices today
00:08:25.800 today you have these large large
00:08:28.639 multinational plant having needing
00:08:31.319 hundreds of thousands of square feet
00:08:33.719 those days even an office of a, or 2,000
00:08:37.039 or 5,000 square ft was big because it's
00:08:40.599 who was the occupiers were professional
00:08:42.679 small businesses small industrialists
00:08:45.519 and all of
00:08:46.720 it and from where did it change was in
00:08:49.600 the late '90s
00:08:52.640 19889 offices changed so we we started
00:08:55.600 building office my first building was on
00:08:58.200 KH Road was called The Prestige Court
00:09:00.560 then we did some two buildings one is
00:09:02.399 copper Arch on Infantry Road and the
00:09:04.880 other is House of Lords on St Marks Road
00:09:07.600 now House of Lords unfortunately we sold
00:09:09.800 it and then we realized you don't
00:09:11.800 maintain it it goes to seed in fact we
00:09:14.600 installed the first escalators there
00:09:16.399 right uh but uh what year was that uh 80
00:09:21.519 88 89 maybe 1990 M then that c change
00:09:26.880 you see then we started getting more and
00:09:28.959 more opportunities on doing office in
00:09:31.480 premium locations where you see we now
00:09:33.760 we we also invented this joint
00:09:35.720 development concept where I told in fact
00:09:38.560 the first one I did was my own
00:09:40.079 father-in-law he wanted to sell his
00:09:41.839 family house I said what I said do you
00:09:44.279 have any use for that money he said no I
00:09:46.800 said if you don't have any use for the
00:09:48.399 money don't sell it because money comes
00:09:50.279 in your hand it'll vanish so I'll do
00:09:53.880 this joint development for you that's
00:09:55.399 how I did this copper Arch so I invented
00:09:58.720 that had to literally tell the lawyers
00:10:01.839 how we had to do the jda agreement and
00:10:05.360 then of course one once you invent one
00:10:08.279 thing then from there it's very easy to
00:10:10.680 replicate and it becomes better and
00:10:12.800 better as time
00:10:14.600 elapses so so that was the thing that
00:10:17.920 happened so when did you structure it as
00:10:19.839 a real estate company when did that
00:10:21.640 happen yeah 85 85 886 was the prestige
00:10:26.160 Estates and properties and Prestige
00:10:28.600 constructions two separate
00:10:32.519 um uh partnership firms were born uh one
00:10:37.160 was to buy land in the other one was to
00:10:40.040 do the construction in but then finally
00:10:42.079 it all got merged became one one firm
00:10:45.000 easy have to operate and then of course
00:10:46.760 now we've got some spvs that's a
00:10:48.959 separate story that you see what
00:10:50.880 happened is based on the need Everything
00:10:53.639 Changes Everything evolves and of course
00:10:56.120 we became a private limited company in I
00:10:58.760 think around 2000 and then publicly
00:11:01.880 listed in
00:11:04.480 2010 and publicly listed and doing very
00:11:07.360 well in the last 3 or 4 years how are
00:11:09.399 you all friends uncle I remember 5 years
00:11:12.399 or six years ago we were at dinner in
00:11:14.600 Dubai in some
00:11:16.560 restaurant and four or five of your
00:11:19.560 competition your competing real estate
00:11:23.680 companies uh you were all telling me
00:11:26.760 that you go on one holiday together
00:11:28.959 every here you catch up this is
00:11:32.760 strange this is something I have not
00:11:34.959 seen in any other industry how does that
00:11:37.360 work but only only in Bangalore this is
00:11:40.320 no not not all over one holiday even I
00:11:42.680 was there with them and I was like this
00:11:44.279 is weird like what is going on it's not
00:11:46.560 weird is he all men with big Egos and
00:11:49.200 lots of money four five of them
00:11:51.160 competing no big egos actually ego is
00:11:53.560 the one that kills you see I always said
00:11:56.720 if you learn how to bend you'll not
00:11:58.880 break M but if you are stiff you you can
00:12:03.200 break and you know we are according to
00:12:05.760 me we all in the same space whether his
00:12:07.920 dad or with her dad like I said I I we
00:12:11.560 grow up we didn't both of us when we got
00:12:14.160 into this business ironically after I
00:12:17.440 did his wedding suit this that I was in
00:12:20.240 my dad shop making clothes and doing
00:12:23.480 suits for people who want to get married
00:12:25.800 and this gentleman was a coffee planter
00:12:27.639 one day he decided to do a build put up
00:12:30.959 a building on Brigade Road and that's
00:12:32.720 how the word Brigade came and presti
00:12:35.839 came from the store that I have right in
00:12:38.639 uh in in Commercial Street so so what
00:12:42.160 happened was we used to go to the same
00:12:45.320 BDA office for one file he wanted a
00:12:48.959 change of land use for his Brigade Road
00:12:50.920 property I wanted to have a change of
00:12:52.600 land use for my St Marks Road property
00:12:55.240 residential to commercial his industri
00:12:57.560 some semiu to commercial
00:12:59.880 so then I always believe there's enough
00:13:02.880 and plenty to do for everybody I that is
00:13:05.639 how I believe in and I think that's how
00:13:07.199 we've taken that
00:13:09.360 leadership it's just it's just that okay
00:13:12.279 if if he's got a client even now today
00:13:14.399 in leing when we doing so much work I'll
00:13:17.680 say okay buddy you've got this Cent now
00:13:20.360 the next one will be mine because your
00:13:21.880 space is
00:13:22.839 over or if it's in we are doing
00:13:25.440 residential each one's got their own
00:13:27.279 unique location unique type of property
00:13:31.600 for that I need not to have daggers and
00:13:33.839 one thing that we have learned in this
00:13:36.160 city at least of course I think now I
00:13:38.040 work in many other cities even in a
00:13:40.279 Mumbai have not nobody has come to trip
00:13:42.680 me down fortunately touchwood that's
00:13:45.519 been the thing because you have to know
00:13:47.320 how to carry people along with you and
00:13:49.920 you should support I've always supported
00:13:52.440 wherever the somebody is in a little bit
00:13:54.040 of trouble you talk to them and see how
00:13:56.000 you can get them out of it and if
00:13:58.120 somebody sensible enough they listen for
00:14:00.079 their own good if you tell them
00:14:01.240 something and they don't listen then
00:14:02.839 they bad luck the one thing everybody
00:14:04.920 does say about you
00:14:07.839 is in social interactions and
00:14:10.480 conversations whenever a lot of people
00:14:12.560 talk about real
00:14:14.079 estate they say Iran is a man of his
00:14:17.720 word and that story has really permeated
00:14:21.920 Society at large where does that come
00:14:24.440 from no no see it's not see you if you
00:14:28.560 have the right intent everything will go
00:14:31.639 well now otherwise if you've got a wrong
00:14:33.720 intent you get the world's best lawyer
00:14:35.600 to do a document and you want to somehow
00:14:38.440 do something wrong it will go wrong and
00:14:40.920 it's always I've seen if you keep up to
00:14:43.399 your word even if it hurts you long term
00:14:46.519 it's a benefit short term there may be a
00:14:49.360 loss or the I would call a perceived
00:14:52.199 loss or a uh you know something that you
00:14:55.079 feel that but then in the long term what
00:14:57.959 really happens is it's that you build
00:15:00.639 Goodwill and I think all the developers
00:15:03.000 in bangalo for that matter that's why
00:15:05.160 they all sort of respected there is that
00:15:08.519 respect so that is I would say worth any
00:15:12.279 money in the world and once that respect
00:15:15.399 develops business grows Everything grows
00:15:19.000 and uh there is a sense of uh you know
00:15:21.680 sort of do you just think it was a way
00:15:23.600 of doing business also back then it was
00:15:26.360 just on a handshake with a handkerchief
00:15:30.759 just you say then of course you see see
00:15:34.160 now I even in today I have a something
00:15:36.920 called when when some land owner comes I
00:15:39.759 take out a book I write down the terms
00:15:42.040 after it's done I pass it on to my legal
00:15:44.040 guys and then afterward that gets into
00:15:46.000 one huge structure document whatever
00:15:48.360 else that is required legally for so
00:15:51.279 many reasons I mean comp plces so many
00:15:54.079 reasons you need it but it's what you
00:15:56.199 have agreed on is what is most important
00:15:59.040 M and if you stick to that there is that
00:16:02.040 so much respect that comes in so much
00:16:04.160 comfort that comes in and I think it's
00:16:06.639 not only us I mean I think the others
00:16:09.040 also who are in this business today in
00:16:11.800 the I mean at least the larger companies
00:16:13.959 are following the same principle even
00:16:15.720 her dad follows the same I think you
00:16:17.519 have to right I think if you're selling
00:16:19.560 somebody their home who's bringing their
00:16:21.319 life savings with you if you don't stick
00:16:24.000 to your word and you um sort of go off
00:16:26.880 of that I think word will get around and
00:16:28.720 I I think it's a downward traj still
00:16:31.680 below nupa I'm talking about you know
00:16:34.199 the larger transactions that you do yeah
00:16:36.680 because what happens you're tying up
00:16:38.079 some land yeah you're you're getting
00:16:40.880 some you're you're either agreeing on a
00:16:42.880 joint development percentage or some
00:16:45.720 deposit or whatever or some
00:16:48.040 specifications with that guy and then
00:16:50.040 you just go through and then it just
00:16:52.399 Falls in place there's a conversation
00:16:54.600 between four of us okay so don't expect
00:16:56.519 me to ask all the questions you can
00:17:00.360 also finishing up his story first yeah
00:17:03.160 then I will come to your story but you
00:17:04.559 can also ask him
00:17:06.319 questions how is it Uncle to manage
00:17:10.839 family in business this applies to all
00:17:13.079 of you I know your brother your father
00:17:16.000 your wife I know nera's Dad I know your
00:17:19.199 kids uh nephews nieces it seems to be a
00:17:25.679 very what was this TV show I was
00:17:27.959 watching uh
00:17:29.360 succession
00:17:33.320 succession like different versions of
00:17:35.559 succession in each of your households
00:17:37.960 how complicated is that so succession is
00:17:40.640 a show I haven't watched because I found
00:17:42.240 all the protagonists quite annoying so I
00:17:45.039 didn't take a liking to any of them but
00:17:47.280 um I think like if you look at it right
00:17:50.600 most businesses are family businesses
00:17:52.360 right 80% of businesses globally start
00:17:55.120 off as family businesses and then they
00:17:56.840 get professionalized and then they um go
00:17:59.960 public so we all start off as family
00:18:02.159 businesses and then you have to decide
00:18:04.280 if second gen wants to continue or not
00:18:07.720 so only I think I was reading somewhere
00:18:09.400 that 36% of businesses get into second
00:18:13.159 gen and then maybe about 11 or 15% get
00:18:17.080 into third gen and maybe only 4% get
00:18:19.720 into fourth gen so I think the um the
00:18:23.640 challenges in the like you were saying
00:18:26.559 managing egos or managing people and
00:18:29.159 managing uh relationships because you
00:18:31.640 might have the perfect or structure but
00:18:33.400 if the human element is not looked into
00:18:36.159 then the disruption happens the way we
00:18:39.080 have done it is my dad was very smart in
00:18:41.520 the sense that he gave my sister and I
00:18:43.640 she's older than me different verticals
00:18:46.280 and then we also have a cousin in the
00:18:47.880 business and we also have another family
00:18:49.520 friend who's like a brother to me anyway
00:18:51.960 and an uncle and then my mother was in
00:18:53.880 the business but all of us handled very
00:18:55.919 different sections and verticals of the
00:18:57.880 business so there's no stepping on each
00:18:59.919 other's toes but like every other family
00:19:03.960 yeah when let's say 10 family members
00:19:08.880 being humans at the end of the day like
00:19:10.799 we all are people get insecure people
00:19:13.919 get jealous somebody gets more
00:19:15.960 validation somebody gets less the Next
00:19:19.520 Generation does not agree with the prior
00:19:21.480 generation in in the idealistic way of
00:19:24.360 thinking all of that how do you cope
00:19:26.559 with that and still stay together I
00:19:28.360 think you you should answer this since
00:19:29.919 you are like managing probably this at
00:19:33.000 the highest level no no I think similar
00:19:36.240 structure what nupa just now
00:19:40.559 enumerated very important thing is this
00:19:43.559 what he very rightly said about stepping
00:19:45.520 on each one's toes toes yeah so we have
00:19:49.200 a each one is doing their own thing and
00:19:51.960 they have the freedom to do it yes but
00:19:55.400 you're absolutely true emotions no I was
00:19:58.799 say that like at least from from our
00:20:01.559 perspective I've seen a break in the
00:20:04.280 family thing like my my my dad his
00:20:07.679 brother and my granddad split when we
00:20:12.080 were very young when my dad had uh was
00:20:14.960 building the business he was also I
00:20:16.520 think around 30 years old and that split
00:20:20.200 was a lot of ego there was like you know
00:20:24.240 maybe some differences of opinion
00:20:26.919 miscommunication also on what was you
00:20:29.159 know the right intention or what you
00:20:31.120 know was actually happening uh and and
00:20:34.159 today know my me and my brothers are
00:20:36.720 sort of coming into the business so
00:20:38.679 seeing how my dad is I think taking some
00:20:43.159 uh learnings or like context from you
00:20:45.640 know situation that he went through and
00:20:47.760 trying to figure out also the way it
00:20:51.039 should pass on and I think that that
00:20:52.760 passing on is extremely different in you
00:20:56.760 know every single family depending on
00:20:59.400 multiple factors you know today we are
00:21:02.039 three boys uh and there's no other you
00:21:05.600 know brother or or sibling of my father
00:21:08.600 in the business so it's maybe slightly
00:21:10.919 easier and we're all taking some
00:21:13.360 interest in you know building a part of
00:21:15.559 the business it gets more complicated
00:21:17.600 with every generation yeah it will it
00:21:18.919 will get more complicated
00:21:22.120 but it also I guess depends on what type
00:21:25.200 of intention ambition the generation
00:21:28.120 shows right that there there can be
00:21:30.640 people who are not interested at all in
00:21:33.320 coming into the business you know how do
00:21:35.840 they get viewed how do they get treated
00:21:38.279 being part of it or someone who's taking
00:21:40.039 more extreme like a lot of initiative
00:21:42.720 and you can really see them putting a
00:21:45.240 lot of effort in so I don't think it's
00:21:47.720 like a equal like I'm not sure if a
00:21:50.240 equals approach Works in all situations
00:21:54.840 but it is important to for some one
00:21:57.799 person like the head to make sure that
00:22:01.400 that Equalization is happening to as
00:22:04.640 Fair as as possible in the end if you
00:22:07.559 look at it everybody needs to have some
00:22:09.440 a certain level of maturity while
00:22:11.360 handling other members but also all our
00:22:15.600 if if you know for lack of a better
00:22:17.440 thing all our wealth or our careers are
00:22:19.440 tied with the success of the company so
00:22:21.279 if we are not mature about it um what's
00:22:24.760 you know what's in the best interest of
00:22:26.200 the companies in the best interest of
00:22:27.960 all the indiv idual as well right so one
00:22:30.679 one key question to ask always is what's
00:22:32.720 in the best interest of the organization
00:22:35.320 you know like you were asking whether to
00:22:37.760 do Residential or office or whatever it
00:22:40.200 is you have to see what is in the best
00:22:41.919 interest of how do you handle it I mean
00:22:43.640 you're sort of also you no see I tell
00:22:46.240 you what good thing is because of being
00:22:48.320 disted yeah I'll tell you everybody
00:22:50.440 knows their value their value now you
00:22:52.640 not listed you should get listed
00:22:56.320 sir there's something called the
00:22:58.080 minority rule M so if four of us are
00:23:01.400 individually of a certain psychology
00:23:04.320 when we come together as a group the
00:23:06.760 psychology of the group is completely
00:23:08.799 different from what we had individually
00:23:11.960 absolutely and three of us might agree
00:23:15.159 and be broadly okay with whatever is
00:23:18.640 happening but if that one person who is
00:23:20.720 the minority who
00:23:22.200 disagrees disagrees vehemently
00:23:25.320 enough we will have to tweak the company
00:23:28.679 or the decision of the group in a manner
00:23:30.640 that appeases the minority this happens
00:23:33.159 with many things right if you ask why is
00:23:36.200 most meat halal today why is Coke a
00:23:39.360 certain way why why are Kosher foods the
00:23:42.960 norm and not the exception you see it
00:23:45.279 across the world in different products
00:23:47.919 so in your family uh or in Iran's family
00:23:51.320 if he has four in the Next Generation
00:23:54.400 and the one who is minority is very
00:23:56.919 strong and very vocal about what he
00:24:00.279 believes how do you get him to go along
00:24:03.120 with the other three majority who are
00:24:04.919 more malleable in a way that's a tough
00:24:07.520 question right it is a tough question
00:24:10.200 fortunately we don't have that situation
00:24:13.080 yeah so right now I agree see right now
00:24:15.279 you're also there so everything
00:24:17.520 everybody listen to whatever you say all
00:24:20.559 decisions are resolved then but I think
00:24:23.360 like you said we are also looking to
00:24:26.039 have a executive Council where the key
00:24:28.039 member because decisions have to be done
00:24:30.320 unanimously and it's either convinced or
00:24:32.039 be convinced and there's a way to do it
00:24:34.200 right there's numbers there's facts I
00:24:36.120 think first generation or ogs as we call
00:24:38.799 them were more intuitive and I think as
00:24:41.520 the organization grows you have to grow
00:24:43.399 from a person dependent organization to
00:24:45.120 a more process driven one so then your
00:24:47.320 numbers will come into play logic will
00:24:49.159 come into play financing will come into
00:24:50.919 play there will be other factors it's
00:24:52.600 not I feel that this is the best
00:24:54.799 decision right we'll have to Showcase it
00:24:56.880 with logic argument number and hopefully
00:24:59.640 it's a convinced or be convinced if you
00:25:01.600 had to start a real estate company that
00:25:03.720 would Thrive
00:25:05.520 today will the thinking of your
00:25:08.279 generation work in that company or the P
00:25:10.520 prior generation binary question you
00:25:12.720 can't have little bit of this and little
00:25:14.240 bit of
00:25:16.240 that would Brigade prior prior I would
00:25:19.799 say prior yeah yeah yeah could you say
00:25:22.840 prior I would say prior because I feel
00:25:24.640 like building a real estate company you
00:25:27.159 need a lot of restate taking ability
00:25:30.159 like if you want to you know build sorry
00:25:32.919 I'm saying your generation no you need
00:25:34.520 to be intuitive no he I think his point
00:25:37.279 is intuition I have a couple of other
00:25:39.200 points which I will add up yeah I think
00:25:41.760 that uh today maybe our generation is
00:25:46.720 you know thinks a little bit too much
00:25:49.159 before getting into you know stuff
00:25:51.520 analysis paralysis and uh and the and in
00:25:54.240 real estate specifically I feel like you
00:25:56.840 do need to take these bold calls you do
00:25:58.880 need to take a lot of risk you do need
00:26:01.520 to build a very strong relationship with
00:26:04.799 you know Partners up front and I think
00:26:06.960 the previous generation was slightly
00:26:09.240 better at doing that I would say if I
00:26:11.799 had to start from scratch but to take
00:26:14.399 over a business and
00:26:16.520 to build a business maybe from a
00:26:19.120 platform or a foundation that it is at
00:26:21.760 today I would say our generation yeah
00:26:25.559 just more generation more ability to
00:26:28.440 tweak it and you know say they had more
00:26:30.679 risk- taking ability 100% I I feel they
00:26:34.200 I mean I've seen also was that because
00:26:36.000 they had lesser to lose yeah 100% one is
00:26:39.720 I mean yours is risk taking but I would
00:26:41.559 say the way they work like I've seen my
00:26:43.760 dad work like long hours 7 days a week
00:26:47.080 There's there is no break but his work
00:26:49.840 is his passion and there is when I ask
00:26:51.720 him is it your passion he's like there's
00:26:53.039 no passion is a luxury right at that
00:26:55.480 point in time when he started it was no
00:26:58.880 choice really are you passionate about
00:27:00.760 real estate n so growing up I I didn't
00:27:04.520 think I was I didn't know what I wanted
00:27:06.039 to do but I've had to learn to love what
00:27:08.760 I do right now so if you ask me today do
00:27:10.880 I love what I do yes I love what I do
00:27:12.799 today but it's been a journey it's been
00:27:14.880 a journey but because you learned to
00:27:16.960 love I learned to love it's like being
00:27:18.360 in a bad
00:27:22.200 marriage no there's so many um I mean
00:27:25.000 did I grow up dreaming of being a
00:27:26.520 developer no and neither did ifan
00:27:28.640 neither did our dads like you learn when
00:27:30.760 you see success you start loving what
00:27:32.360 you do if you see constant failure you
00:27:34.279 you'll hate even your passion I think
00:27:36.559 that's about all passion yeah so passion
00:27:38.960 cannot be your job is what I believe
00:27:41.039 okay so I have a different take on it
00:27:43.240 passion can feel like you're generally
00:27:46.240 passionate about something or your mind
00:27:48.200 feels this is your passion when you're a
00:27:50.399 little bit better at something than
00:27:51.880 other people around
00:27:53.559 you see there are two sides to it if we
00:27:56.840 just go back to the first part of the
00:27:58.519 question I have learned to love what I
00:28:00.960 do because if you don't love what you do
00:28:03.360 you can't put in the hours and I don't
00:28:05.159 think you can be become good at it
00:28:06.840 because your desire to learn and all
00:28:08.840 that won't be there but I have a flip
00:28:11.120 side it's also what are you willing to
00:28:12.559 suffer for you know is this worth the
00:28:14.880 suffering see it's not an easy business
00:28:16.960 I don't think real estate is easy and I
00:28:19.480 would say most it is a lot of donkey
00:28:21.679 work also you donkey work is the most
00:28:24.440 difficult business to be in most
00:28:26.440 thankless job and okay we are in it we
00:28:29.480 are in it uh we we thrive in it yeah we
00:28:33.559 like you said we love what we are doing
00:28:36.080 and you see what what I love most about
00:28:39.559 is you're creating something yeah it's
00:28:42.399 it's like an artist now see I see that
00:28:44.440 lovely painting there now that artist
00:28:46.240 will be looking at that painting looking
00:28:48.440 at every stroke trying to better it
00:28:50.640 making it nicer so I think that's what
00:28:53.039 we are doing we see it starts from one
00:28:55.399 just that Barren piece of land and then
00:28:58.120 you are creating you see scale every it
00:29:00.960 keeps changing with scale and it's it's
00:29:05.159 that creation what you're doing and what
00:29:06.960 you're putting up is what really gives
00:29:08.720 you that thrilled that energizes you if
00:29:11.840 I go to my side over if if I go to my S
00:29:17.000 what happens is it maybe you'll be going
00:29:19.039 through mud and dust and everything else
00:29:22.399 but to see it getting transformed it
00:29:24.519 just actually energizes you but like
00:29:26.720 nupa said it is the most difficult
00:29:29.440 business you can be in here every single
00:29:32.480 piece of land you purchase you need to
00:29:35.120 get all the licenses some hundreds of
00:29:37.080 them and then the most important part is
00:29:39.960 you have the other part of it you have
00:29:42.200 to do salute to all the people that you
00:29:45.519 need not so that that's you have to
00:29:48.640 learn to love all of that
00:29:50.880 come in fact sometimes we as parents we
00:29:54.080 say when we and then we say how will our
00:29:55.799 children be able to do whatever like
00:29:57.720 when we talk about it we talking about
00:29:59.360 you you and my children so it's it's a
00:30:01.880 tough one and then you have to have that
00:30:03.679 mindset if somebody is even bashing up
00:30:06.080 you have to have that ability to keep
00:30:07.720 smiling and being nice and being
00:30:10.760 diplomatic about it because if you're
00:30:12.440 not then again you you're in trouble so
00:30:15.360 that's that's a whole uh thing I like
00:30:17.120 what you said passion is overrated it it
00:30:19.600 sounds like the the intro line to
00:30:22.679 succession next
00:30:24.120 year but I would rather be okay I'll
00:30:27.320 give you two scenario
00:30:28.720 I would you rather be passionately doing
00:30:32.279 something which loses money or
00:30:34.679 dispassionately doing something that
00:30:36.279 makes you money easy option option b I
00:30:38.559 would
00:30:40.320 any please I make the money then I'll
00:30:43.000 find some other passion to do yeah I
00:30:45.799 believe that is true I every project of
00:30:48.640 yours can't make money sometimes you run
00:30:51.320 into trouble sometime there's some you
00:30:54.600 not not sort of taking into account some
00:30:58.440 expenses that come unforeseen but I
00:31:01.559 think no businessman whichever business
00:31:04.240 you in would like to lose money how good
00:31:06.960 would you be at a
00:31:08.919 dispassionate job I mean what you what
00:31:11.679 output you like put out will never be so
00:31:14.760 maybe there is no true thing such as
00:31:17.519 Talent OR passion but we all try a bunch
00:31:20.240 of things whatever we are slightly
00:31:22.720 better than our peers at we start to
00:31:25.279 believe that is our passion and that is
00:31:27.559 our t Talent it's more enjoyable right I
00:31:30.279 mean you want to be good at something
00:31:31.960 you don't want to keep because we all in
00:31:34.120 very competitive right yes you guys are
00:31:36.440 in a very tough position I believe in
00:31:39.200 society the hardest role to have is to
00:31:42.840 be the son or daughter of somebody
00:31:45.799 extremely successful famous
00:31:50.000 Rich because you're always in this
00:31:52.880 position where people look at you like
00:31:56.000 you're entitled but but in your own head
00:32:00.279 you have the psychology that for me to
00:32:02.480 find my own validation and respect cuz
00:32:05.440 everything you're born with is the
00:32:06.720 status quo right that's not going to
00:32:08.240 make you happy if happiness is each time
00:32:11.600 there is change a positive change it's
00:32:14.559 harder for you guys to get it no so I
00:32:17.480 think that's a valid statement I think I
00:32:20.960 we can talk about our Journeys but I
00:32:22.799 definitely went through that a bit of
00:32:25.200 that when I first came into the business
00:32:27.279 because I was like like okay my dad's
00:32:29.600 known he had a bit of a rags to Rich's
00:32:31.799 story and you know he's known as a
00:32:34.279 Visionary very high Acumen could can't
00:32:36.679 find faults with a guy and I was like
00:32:38.200 how am I going to fill in those shoes
00:32:39.799 right so it took me a while and like I
00:32:42.000 said for me it was a journey to be very
00:32:44.039 comfortable secure confident in this
00:32:47.120 role like it was a journey for me I've
00:32:48.720 been in the business now 15 years and it
00:32:50.919 was a journey and I real I realized I I
00:32:53.600 can't try to even like my role should
00:32:56.320 not be to fill in his shoes it'll take
00:32:58.039 an army to fill in his shoes I need to
00:33:00.080 just fill in my own shoes and add
00:33:02.279 something different you know that maybe
00:33:03.960 he doesn't do and to the previous
00:33:06.360 question you were asking what a company
00:33:08.240 needs to grow from A to B is different
00:33:10.240 from maybe what it needs from B to C and
00:33:12.840 so for me it was what do I need to do or
00:33:15.679 what do I need to do to help grow the
00:33:17.600 company from B to C or C to D it can't
00:33:20.120 be what my dad did there's no way in
00:33:21.799 hell I'm not in competition with him I'm
00:33:24.039 not trying to be better than him I need
00:33:26.000 to find what makes my space yeah what
00:33:29.639 makes me me and what value I can add and
00:33:31.880 but when Society tells you not openly
00:33:35.279 yeah but at some point your subconscious
00:33:38.120 get gets hit when people say sho got all
00:33:40.919 this yeah Silver Spoon doesn't that make
00:33:42.679 you feel competitive she's only with
00:33:44.760 your own father no no no so she the the
00:33:48.200 thing is that okay um she's only where
00:33:50.320 she is because it's her father she's
00:33:53.120 father's company she got a leg up yeah I
00:33:54.919 did get a leg up but I didn't screw it
00:33:56.960 up I was given a platform working hard
00:34:00.120 for it yeah we we're given a platform
00:34:02.720 and I can either screw it up or I can
00:34:05.960 take it to Greater Heights so there have
00:34:08.879 been opportunities where nobody talks
00:34:10.599 about those stories where the second gen
00:34:12.239 has screwed it up and maybe that's why
00:34:13.639 they don't go into second gen and third
00:34:15.599 gen you're talking to us because we've
00:34:17.560 been able to take it to the next level
00:34:20.199 generally third gen screws it up right
00:34:21.839 generally third gen so I'm a
00:34:23.879 little they have time I would say for me
00:34:27.320 it it has been a like a
00:34:30.440 defining angle to you know the path that
00:34:33.960 I always like definitely wanted to pick
00:34:37.359 even from when I was younger when I was
00:34:39.399 in college even to not jump in straight
00:34:42.119 into the family business to try to do
00:34:44.199 something even if it was small like just
00:34:46.119 set up you know a restaurant and do that
00:34:48.079 it was for me like a validation that I
00:34:51.839 could do something without having to you
00:34:55.719 know sort of like rely on
00:34:58.560 the the family business or or you know
00:35:00.839 kind of what my my dad's built I think a
00:35:03.320 big reason why I have like you know
00:35:06.880 tried to like have a branch out also of
00:35:10.240 the traditional real estate business
00:35:11.760 with just focusing on wework and
00:35:13.400 building that
00:35:15.160 was kind of a Best of Both Worlds where
00:35:18.000 under you know the umbrella and you know
00:35:20.800 with with the Legacy and able to sort of
00:35:23.160 like continue the Legacy you add some
00:35:26.160 contributing factor which you know
00:35:28.240 hopefully is end up becoming as big or
00:35:31.680 you know like will add something in
00:35:34.359 equal parts I think to the business I I
00:35:37.839 think that's my way of looking at it
00:35:40.680 where and I fortunate enough that I even
00:35:43.000 got the you know the ability the freedom
00:35:45.000 to springboard off the platform and then
00:35:48.480 be able to like you know do this which
00:35:50.359 has had its own journey and you know
00:35:52.880 touch with now that things are going
00:35:54.319 well I can say that but there could have
00:35:55.800 been you know very well situation where
00:35:58.319 it it just went completely under and uh
00:36:00.839 then I had to like retract back we all
00:36:02.960 have a chip on our shoulder have
00:36:05.079 something truly unfiltered dream is VOR
00:36:08.920 bigger than
00:36:09.960 Embassy I would love it to be but is it
00:36:13.440 is it now in your unfiltered dreams no
00:36:16.200 definitely not not yet what do you dream
00:36:18.000 about currently what do I dream about I
00:36:21.440 dream about I actually
00:36:25.280 uh I do believe that
00:36:28.480 the competition is like healthy in some
00:36:32.640 way and and growing up with three
00:36:34.920 brothers it's probably you know even
00:36:37.359 more so across like everything that
00:36:39.160 we've done but we have like such a
00:36:41.160 strong bond that it is like you know
00:36:45.040 love and each other success is probably
00:36:48.800 the defining thing that like I dream
00:36:52.720 about which is you know we each are able
00:36:56.119 to put or add something like what if it
00:36:58.880 was not like that and one of you could
00:37:00.640 pick like only one of you would be
00:37:03.119 picked to be successful then what
00:37:04.920 happens between the three brothers yikes
00:37:08.240 what happens to me or who gets the pick
00:37:10.520 no no do you do you still feel that
00:37:14.000 way um see you're assuming a scenario
00:37:17.319 where there is opportunity for all three
00:37:19.119 of you to be successful at different
00:37:20.920 things right what if there's only one
00:37:22.760 thing and one of you can lead it then
00:37:24.280 what happens because this is like a
00:37:26.760 succession kind of episode I
00:37:28.880 mean I think that that um it's it's
00:37:32.960 important for the person who is that to
00:37:36.760 keep their ego aside right if you really
00:37:40.960 truly want like to continue the Legacy
00:37:43.800 there are obviously like situations of
00:37:46.079 people who will you know let that get to
00:37:49.040 their head and you know completely move
00:37:51.760 the other way leaving everyone behind I
00:37:53.800 think there's two approaches to it you
00:37:55.280 can you can be the person that has that
00:37:59.319 and keep your ego aside for the larger
00:38:02.599 interest of you know what had come
00:38:05.720 before and then what should be the
00:38:07.920 situation later right like we spoke
00:38:10.000 about third
00:38:11.319 generation sort of like deteriorating it
00:38:14.000 but that doesn't have to be the case
00:38:16.040 there is ways and there have been enough
00:38:18.319 families that multiple Generations even
00:38:20.960 up to fifth or six Generations have
00:38:22.560 built huge Enterprises I mean you know
00:38:25.200 companies like Walmart and things like
00:38:27.880 that in the US not so many Indian
00:38:29.240 examples no but I feel like India is
00:38:32.240 sort of where and you know my dad also
00:38:34.640 says it's like where America maybe was
00:38:36.400 in the ' 80s or 7s or ' 80s where most
00:38:39.520 companies were family businesses they
00:38:41.760 will slowly transition into you know
00:38:44.480 being public I think your world also
00:38:46.400 gets to see how many are transitioning
00:38:48.280 into that into that field and then
00:38:50.920 they'll get professional and you'll have
00:38:52.560 boards and you'll have Charters and
00:38:54.560 structures and succession planning and
00:38:57.440 all of that will happen like it has in
00:39:00.319 many countries and China is another
00:39:02.800 example where you know similar things
00:39:04.839 happen where you don't really know the
00:39:07.280 faces of those companies but the wealth
00:39:10.640 has definitely passed on multiple
00:39:13.440 Generations right and um I seen a lot of
00:39:16.400 wealthy people Wealthy on paper uh techy
00:39:19.599 guys software
00:39:22.079 companies uh rich people in different
00:39:25.400 Industries nobody feels so nobody feels
00:39:29.000 even remotely close to as wealthy as
00:39:31.160 real estate people your houses your cars
00:39:35.359 your planes like why do real estate I
00:39:38.119 think it's like cash flow over valuation
00:39:40.960 that's the yeah I mean because like it's
00:39:43.640 the best investment class that's
00:39:45.960 why not really you see of course at
00:39:48.720 least today the bankers also have
00:39:50.560 learned the value of real estate because
00:39:52.480 that's the only asset that can't go up
00:39:54.280 in
00:39:55.200 smoke at least even if have something to
00:39:59.040 hold on to which they can if they hold
00:40:00.839 on longer they'll actually make money
00:40:02.520 out of it rather than lose money from
00:40:04.359 the whatever they have to recover you
00:40:06.359 know Uncle that is what scares me most
00:40:08.119 about real estate like if I were to put
00:40:10.880 five real estate developers in a room
00:40:14.160 the older they are the more they will be
00:40:16.200 forceful about this but every single one
00:40:19.000 of them will believe real estate prices
00:40:21.000 can never go down whatever happens no no
00:40:24.319 no see it it depends country to Country
00:40:26.839 population into population now take cut
00:40:29.760 and just come to
00:40:31.440 India with the type of population that
00:40:34.160 you have in this country and there's is
00:40:37.119 still according to me a tip of the
00:40:38.760 iceberg there's you know there's still
00:40:41.040 lot more urbanization that has to happen
00:40:43.800 lot more people who are aspirationally
00:40:46.599 wanting to buy a home yes there have
00:40:49.000 been periods real estate always has its
00:40:51.680 periods where suddenly price goes up too
00:40:53.839 high too fast then there's a plateau and
00:40:57.359 that Plateau continues for a little
00:40:59.119 while where price neither goes down
00:41:02.079 doesn't correct itself doesn't go up or
00:41:04.240 if somebody wants that's why we say real
00:41:06.000 estate is il liquid you want to sell
00:41:08.040 there's not too many buyers what the
00:41:09.480 what if the demographic and then with
00:41:11.280 the inflation it goes up again but with
00:41:13.760 the type of people that we have in our
00:41:16.040 country the type of job creation that's
00:41:18.400 happening the type of industrialization
00:41:20.400 we're talking about and and we are
00:41:22.960 seeing it real see now in initial days
00:41:25.960 when we got into this business who was I
00:41:28.000 selling to who was my buyer it was
00:41:30.160 people who were retired who had their
00:41:32.400 Provident fund or who had sold some
00:41:34.920 property somewhere in a larger City and
00:41:36.839 the bigger city and came here with that
00:41:38.800 little extra and wanted to buy a house
00:41:41.480 and then the the transactions were few
00:41:43.440 and far between just this morning I read
00:41:45.960 that the maximum housing sales have
00:41:47.839 happened in the last quarter why is that
00:41:50.640 it's only because there is their demand
00:41:53.599 is very real can I make a counter
00:41:56.280 argument make a counter what if the
00:41:58.760 demographic see let's say India's
00:42:01.920 population is X to retain that
00:42:04.680 population every couple has to give
00:42:06.520 birth to 2.1 children replenishment rate
00:42:10.280 40 years ago we were giving birth to
00:42:12.200 four five children per couple today that
00:42:15.599 number is 2.2 2.3 in in many states it's
00:42:20.160 under
00:42:21.520 2.1 the immediate effect of that will be
00:42:25.920 at any given point of time instead of
00:42:28.119 having four generations looking for
00:42:29.880 housing we'll start to have three
00:42:31.880 because even the women who are giving
00:42:33.400 birth are giving birth at 35 instead of
00:42:35.960 20 correct tomorrow if we get to that
00:42:40.119 point where India like Japan has a has a
00:42:45.000 large percentage of our population which
00:42:47.119 is older and there are lesser young
00:42:49.559 people coming in and older people I
00:42:52.119 would assume need lesser real
00:42:54.200 estate combined with that that somehow
00:42:56.800 we Buck the urbanization pattern that we
00:42:59.599 have witnessed in China because of work
00:43:01.640 from home and a bunch of different
00:43:03.359 things don't these don't these risks
00:43:07.640 need to be factored in into that
00:43:10.520 dialogue of real estate will always go
00:43:12.400 up yeah yeah that that's not going to
00:43:14.440 happen that's not going to happen in
00:43:16.520 very soon today not tomorrow in 30
00:43:20.559 40 anything that's consumption I mean
00:43:23.720 not necessarily just real estate it's
00:43:25.559 Lally everything then but I think as
00:43:27.960 people are becoming more affluent
00:43:30.400 they're consuming more energy they're
00:43:32.760 consuming more fmcg because that is
00:43:35.880 essentially attributable to the fact
00:43:38.240 that they can afford it now but
00:43:39.559 everything is like I want a better
00:43:41.000 quality of life now as of home is
00:43:44.319 included the thing is there is a
00:43:46.640 shortage real shortage there's the real
00:43:49.880 need and by the time we have that like
00:43:52.680 it's just like our
00:43:54.280 infrastructure the the population has
00:43:56.520 grown the business has grown the
00:43:58.520 development has grown and our
00:44:00.599 infrastructure is always trying to play
00:44:02.839 the catchup game now look at our roads
00:44:04.920 look at our traffic it's not that
00:44:06.599 infrastructure hasn't improved it has
00:44:09.400 but the traffic has improved that much
00:44:11.240 more
00:44:12.079 exponentially so it's similarly for us
00:44:14.640 you see there is a real demand and that
00:44:17.200 real demand it'll go that is why just
00:44:19.119 before we started this conversation I
00:44:20.800 was telling Raa I think always what we
00:44:23.440 need to have is an eye on who is my
00:44:26.599 customer
00:44:28.079 who can afford me what type of pricing
00:44:30.480 they can afford me and that has to be
00:44:32.640 from the mass if that is my product and
00:44:35.800 that is where I'm targeting I'll have
00:44:37.800 enough business to go around now if I'm
00:44:40.160 just doing very luxury housing okay that
00:44:42.920 also I can do but I should be happy to
00:44:45.680 just be very content with that niche
00:44:48.000 market where I'll do lesser Revenue
00:44:50.559 lesser business it's not that the
00:44:52.000 business will not happen it's not that
00:44:53.480 they are no takers for that they will be
00:44:55.520 takers for that but in know smaller
00:44:57.680 measure okay the satisfaction is like
00:45:01.280 you know is just doing something very
00:45:04.680 very unique something special and just
00:45:07.880 keeping it only as a collector's item
00:45:09.839 for a few people or whether I want to do
00:45:12.359 a product which is for the MK s if I may
00:45:14.920 just jump in on that um see just prior
00:45:17.480 to covid there was this whole thing of
00:45:20.079 this what you were saying right the new
00:45:22.359 generation doesn't want to own a car
00:45:23.839 they're going to rent a car with Uber
00:45:25.720 nobody's going to live in hotel rooms
00:45:27.839 it's going to be Airbnb so there was
00:45:29.559 this whole discussion and debate about
00:45:32.280 uh whether people will buy homes or only
00:45:34.200 rent homes right and now you know fast
00:45:37.240 forward to 2023 or 2024 we're seeing
00:45:39.720 decadal highs we've not seen this kind
00:45:41.559 of demand ever one reason of course is
00:45:44.079 urbanization what what anle was saying
00:45:47.440 right now Urban cities are at 35%
00:45:50.599 urbanized like 35% of the population
00:45:52.640 lives in urban cities which is about 480
00:45:55.440 million people m this is expected to go
00:45:58.040 up to 40% by some 20 30 or so which is
00:46:01.520 600 which is sorry yeah about 600
00:46:03.800 million people like where are all those
00:46:05.880 homes getting built Indian developers
00:46:07.800 put together probably put out in the top
00:46:10.480 eight cities about 500 450,000 to
00:46:13.040 500,000 units but you're talking about
00:46:15.680 120 million people coming into the
00:46:18.240 cities this the demand and the
00:46:19.960 macroeconomics are so favorable to real
00:46:22.599 estate no I agree there is demand I'm
00:46:24.280 trying to predict the curve that the
00:46:27.079 future curve of the demand are we
00:46:28.720 looking forward 5 years in seeing
00:46:30.359 there's demand or we looking forward 50
00:46:32.079 in seeing there's demand I mean I think
00:46:33.640 the volumes of the demographic is so
00:46:35.720 high that it's multi- decades right it's
00:46:38.200 I don't think it's like a fiveyear
00:46:40.480 situation if we were let's say in a much
00:46:42.200 smaller country where you were talking
00:46:43.800 about I don't know a million 2 million 5
00:46:46.160 million people being the population I
00:46:48.520 think it's a different discussion when
00:46:50.040 we're talking about 1 Point whatever 7
00:46:53.119 billion and such a you know only a small
00:46:56.440 percent it's at the upper pyramid and
00:47:00.000 such a huge volume like this tidal wave
00:47:02.880 that's moving upwards and you know our
00:47:05.119 aspirational want a better life are
00:47:07.839 moving to bigger cities it's not
00:47:11.000 physically possible to even just build
00:47:13.559 you know that type of capacity where you
00:47:16.440 would where Supply would outpace the
00:47:19.480 demand to the time it takes to just put
00:47:21.640 up an apartment or like get the
00:47:23.319 approvals and all that like you know 5
00:47:25.599 seven years when you talk about buying
00:47:27.400 the land getting all the approvals then
00:47:29.359 3 years to build it and then finally
00:47:31.880 sell it and you know all of that it's
00:47:35.240 it's such a long period that it would be
00:47:37.280 impossible for the supply to do you do
00:47:39.440 you agree that real estate prices today
00:47:42.880 for Land End finished product are
00:47:47.160 pricey see it's I we are being very very
00:47:51.280 conservative in our pricing according to
00:47:54.359 me it has to be very sensibly price
00:47:57.200 because otherwise affordability doesn't
00:47:59.200 hit in moment you become pricey the
00:48:02.200 number of customers reduce the number of
00:48:05.240 takers reduce so we have to balance both
00:48:09.319 together properly so that's why our
00:48:10.800 margins are all very very very minimal I
00:48:13.720 mean you go anywhere else in the world
00:48:15.160 the margins for Real Estate developers
00:48:17.040 are huge for the type of trouble they
00:48:19.240 take the last few years I think postco
00:48:22.000 there wasn't much of a price
00:48:23.160 appreciation right in 2020 21 22 there
00:48:26.240 wasn't too much of a price appreciation
00:48:28.559 last couple of years and and prior to co
00:48:30.800 we used to see what an average of 5 to
00:48:33.000 7% increase per year but in the last
00:48:36.119 couple of years I think we've seen 20%
00:48:38.520 increases 25% increases and that's
00:48:40.680 mainly because of just the latent demand
00:48:43.240 sometimes more no 100% yeah I'm saying
00:48:45.640 on not 100% but like say 20 25% and
00:48:49.760 that's a factor of two reasons one is
00:48:51.799 because there's just no inventory um in
00:48:54.960 our major cities like Bangalore has an
00:48:56.960 overhang of what three and a half
00:48:58.319 quarters which is 9 months or so and
00:49:01.359 just to get projects approved it takes 9
00:49:03.640 to 12 months 18 months okay 18 months in
00:49:06.640 some cases but on average about 9 to 12
00:49:08.839 months so there is like all the
00:49:11.040 inventory that we have will sort of run
00:49:13.280 out if we don't launch more and more
00:49:15.280 projects so that's the kind of demand
00:49:16.720 that there is um yeah so that's why I
00:49:19.720 think that I mean all players have
00:49:21.680 deeper Pockets willing to spend more lot
00:49:24.440 more listed companies need to grow
00:49:27.240 so there is some amount of little bit of
00:49:30.400 splurging also happening irres like not
00:49:33.000 everyone has been as responsible with
00:49:36.400 you know pricing and signing certain jda
00:49:39.520 terms or paying you know certain price
00:49:41.480 for land and and things like that I
00:49:43.640 think Mumbai the type of prices the way
00:49:46.520 the prices have you know sort of like
00:49:48.480 gone up it has a trickle in fact of how
00:49:51.400 much it cost to buy the land or or buy
00:49:53.720 fresh land which is I think why also a
00:49:55.640 lot of Developers prefer a j jda type of
00:49:59.359 you know structure because it's much
00:50:01.680 lighter I can I can put stuff up much
00:50:04.079 much quicker I have a different take on
00:50:06.440 this you know we developers do the hard
00:50:08.760 work yeah we create the wealth for
00:50:11.359 others yeah honestly who are the others
00:50:14.599 the others mean my buyers and land
00:50:16.720 owners no no land owners is one one side
00:50:20.760 it's you see I've never seen any of my
00:50:22.960 buyer who was bought for X who's not
00:50:25.920 gone 2x or 3x or
00:50:28.440 4X so it's it's easy if I mean okay we
00:50:32.160 sell on plan so what happens that
00:50:35.000 somebody has to have the belief in us
00:50:36.760 that we're going to produce whatever we
00:50:38.359 are promising and deliver it within that
00:50:40.480 time frame within that spec but if I've
00:50:43.079 really done that and which invariably we
00:50:46.520 have been doing year on year project
00:50:48.520 after project the end product the
00:50:51.000 customer who buys okay maybe 80% or 70%
00:50:54.520 buying for their own own use uh but
00:50:57.559 there there are people who are also
00:50:59.160 investing and their value just goes up
00:51:02.520 exponentially and these are the guys who
00:51:05.040 really benefit even for that matter land
00:51:08.880 you see land is X about 10 years ago or
00:51:12.599 five years ago it's it's a different
00:51:14.280 price today so it's it's basically all
00:51:17.680 the work that we do the type of
00:51:19.839 creativity that we do it and the type of
00:51:22.079 problem that we go through to put up
00:51:23.960 that development the benefici is
00:51:27.480 multifold first it starts with the
00:51:29.280 government then it starts with my buyer
00:51:31.160 then it starts with everybody else and
00:51:33.280 the user
00:51:34.480 also see so we we I should we should
00:51:37.839 take pride that we are doing all the
00:51:40.799 hard and dirty work and we are
00:51:43.440 responsible to see that we are creating
00:51:45.760 wealth I'm telling you don't smile
00:51:48.160 because if you want any product from SM
00:51:51.079 smiling because she's agreeing with me
00:51:53.319 unless she's disagreeing with me in in
00:51:55.559 the US and like that actually everything
00:51:57.960 is loaded onto the contractor the
00:51:59.839 contractor its TurnKey there the
00:52:01.359 developer just gives The Branding the
00:52:03.319 marketing buys the land all the uh Dirty
00:52:06.400 Work is actually done by the contractor
00:52:08.119 here everything is done by the Builder
00:52:09.839 isn't construction outsourced even here
00:52:12.000 construction is outsourced but they only
00:52:13.920 do conr companies like are also doing
00:52:16.960 the internal work sub contract but
00:52:19.960 everything is supervised by the
00:52:21.319 developer everything is supervised what
00:52:23.559 I'm saying is the contractors only do
00:52:25.400 the construction which even then if
00:52:27.400 something goes
00:52:28.480 wrong it's the developer's name that
00:52:30.640 will get tarnished so in the end we are
00:52:32.440 the principal uh employer don't you
00:52:35.400 agree we doing the Dirty Work yeah don't
00:52:37.839 you agree that we are creating wealth
00:52:39.520 for
00:52:40.440 others yes or no isn't your product that
00:52:44.040 you've sold on plan and what is now when
00:52:46.240 it's ready actually we should be getting
00:52:47.920 higher returns than we currently are
00:52:49.559 because agreed actually actually if you
00:52:52.079 look at the listed entities the margins
00:52:53.839 like you said profit after tax is very
00:52:55.760 slim make 11 12% margin that's it that's
00:52:58.680 in a yeah in a good year otherwise
00:53:00.680 sometimes it's high single digits also
00:53:02.760 Pat I'm talking about Pat why is there a
00:53:04.559 difference in that margin number between
00:53:06.920 different companies listed ones it's
00:53:08.799 around the same it's like maybe a
00:53:10.319 percentage or two different um it's just
00:53:12.480 operational efficiencies it's your jda
00:53:14.799 sharing ratios it's your procurement how
00:53:17.960 efficient are your procurement um yeah
00:53:20.640 cost of constru also the question we
00:53:23.040 want to answer today okay before we
00:53:25.079 finish our conversation
00:53:27.880 we always speak to Young WABE
00:53:31.400 entrepreneurs so we need to tell someone
00:53:34.200 young how do I start a
00:53:36.920 company anything real estate related or
00:53:39.760 a real estate
00:53:41.040 company and the second question is
00:53:43.799 should they invest for people who have
00:53:46.280 the means should it be commercial should
00:53:48.559 it be residential should they uh do
00:53:52.119 fractional real estate so we want the
00:53:54.599 answer primarily to the question I'm
00:53:56.839 young I'm 20 years old I want to start a
00:53:59.319 real estate company how do I go about it
00:54:02.400 if we were to start the Journey of real
00:54:04.720 estate
00:54:05.880 companies at some point it used to work
00:54:08.319 in the manner that you would design a
00:54:10.839 certain project you would go to a bunch
00:54:13.160 of people they would give you money and
00:54:15.160 they would buy and with that you would
00:54:17.000 execute the project when did that happen
00:54:19.760 up
00:54:20.960 until that's happening even
00:54:23.880 now see that that's how rules where you
00:54:26.720 need to have done acquired the land done
00:54:29.839 ABC before you sell right yeah yeah yeah
00:54:32.000 see the thing is yeah you're right to a
00:54:34.160 certain extent that's why everything
00:54:36.319 went wrong in real estate also where
00:54:38.400 when people probably thought they had
00:54:41.200 the land they thought that they had the
00:54:43.480 approval or they thought that they can
00:54:45.079 get the approval and then they went to a
00:54:47.599 bunch of people and said listen I've got
00:54:49.400 this land I've got this approval I'm
00:54:51.559 putting up this building and then uh uh
00:54:54.960 you know then everything became
00:54:56.559 nightmare everything went wrong that's
00:54:58.760 where the confidence also was lost among
00:55:01.400 people of real estate and when we were
00:55:03.920 all looked at as like those big bad guys
00:55:07.200 but now with Rara in place that's how
00:55:09.799 another factor that has really uh change
00:55:12.799 the market is that because there's a
00:55:14.720 confidence now I said there's that that
00:55:16.720 much more it's now completely
00:55:18.559 transparent you have to have everything
00:55:21.000 in place of course the land first and
00:55:22.920 then the approvals most importantly then
00:55:25.760 you log in for get your era number that
00:55:28.559 that that is very cumbersome so what it
00:55:31.240 has done is it has Consolidated the
00:55:33.359 number of players itself and I always
00:55:35.720 say the people refer as big players
00:55:37.760 small players I don't I definitely don't
00:55:40.400 subscribe to that it can be even the
00:55:42.720 smallest of the player doing one single
00:55:44.720 project if you do it well do it
00:55:46.960 professionally do it sincerely you can
00:55:49.240 succeed it's not that you can't succeed
00:55:51.880 okay in the olden days you could just if
00:55:55.640 you did it sincerely and said okay I've
00:55:57.799 got this land I've got I'm going to get
00:55:59.559 this approval I've already got it I'm
00:56:01.599 pre-selling even today we do the same
00:56:03.480 thing we do pre-selling the only
00:56:05.319 difference is today you do it with all
00:56:07.160 approvals everything in place so nothing
00:56:09.039 there's no nothing left to for things to
00:56:11.880 go wrong except that you are Midway of a
00:56:14.480 project somebody files a uh litigation
00:56:17.760 against you for no reason whatsoever
00:56:20.079 that is something that you can't predict
00:56:22.720 that can happen to anybody anytime
00:56:24.640 anywhere but those are like very small
00:56:27.640 cases but if somebody really wants to
00:56:29.400 get into real estate is a youngster yes
00:56:32.319 you have to learn to start small you
00:56:35.720 have to learn to take the baby steps
00:56:37.799 first you see if I have to come to
00:56:39.880 your either I take the lift it's not
00:56:42.359 possible if you have to climb the steps
00:56:44.160 one by one reach Flow by flow reach the
00:56:46.960 top you just can't go to the top from
00:56:49.480 bottom to it's not that easy you have to
00:56:52.359 work hard you have to work for it and if
00:56:54.280 you've done some work if you you've got
00:56:56.720 the confidence you've produced it once
00:56:58.680 done it second time done it third time
00:57:01.160 then there's nothing stopping you that I
00:57:03.119 think that's how everybody started yeah
00:57:05.079 I think everybody started that way and I
00:57:06.760 think the first one is always the
00:57:07.960 hardest because you don't have an
00:57:10.400 established brand people don't know if
00:57:12.359 everything um is proper they don't know
00:57:14.480 who you are they don't know who you are
00:57:16.039 but I think now again given that if
00:57:18.680 you're R approved that means most of the
00:57:20.839 sanctions are in place and everything
00:57:22.359 not all the sanctions in place all are
00:57:24.079 in place like uh so then you can't start
00:57:26.559 your project without getting your if I'm
00:57:28.640 20 and I've been I managed to borrow 10
00:57:30.920 crores from a bank I want to start a
00:57:32.760 real estate company what do do I what do
00:57:34.440 I do next I I don't know like you know
00:57:36.240 real estate also is now so Broad and
00:57:39.839 there just so many level can you define
00:57:41.640 how broad how big is the real estate
00:57:43.319 sector in India oh I don't know the
00:57:46.000 exact like it's supposed to be $1
00:57:48.640 trillion by 20 I look at you know the so
00:57:51.960 say about 650 billion now yeah 1
00:57:53.960 trillion it should be 1
00:57:56.480 right there are obviously you can just
00:57:58.079 do land aggregation as your sole part
00:58:01.200 within real estate you can be a full
00:58:03.440 stack developer that is you know doing
00:58:05.920 everything you can be just in the
00:58:08.119 construction contracting business you
00:58:10.640 can be just a broker you can be just
00:58:12.640 doing Property Management you can build
00:58:14.640 prop Tech on top of it you could do you
00:58:17.319 know online uh like brokerage which is
00:58:20.160 now you know moving in that direction so
00:58:23.119 what should I do I have 10 crores I
00:58:25.119 borrowed from a bank we established that
00:58:27.720 the real estate market is 600 billion in
00:58:29.880 total residential is about
00:58:32.400 45% commercial is 10 plotting is 12 and
00:58:36.319 mixed and others are
00:58:37.920 30% I want to deploy my money and start
00:58:40.720 a business give me one two three in the
00:58:43.599 real estate world what should I
00:58:46.440 do should I be a broker should I be a
00:58:50.079 see you need to learn the business first
00:58:52.240 yeah I would say the only way to learn
00:58:54.200 the business is da in property buy
00:58:57.480 property sell prop is that how I should
00:58:59.079 start buy and sell property yeah I think
00:59:00.640 that way you'll get to know the nuances
00:59:02.640 you'll not to know how to read a
00:59:04.440 contract you'll get to know I would I
00:59:06.720 would look at an angle where there's
00:59:08.559 firstly not enough players there's not
00:59:11.839 you know all these big big guys and then
00:59:14.799 find find an angle in there which no
00:59:16.960 otherwise simple take a small property
00:59:19.359 buy a small plot either get into a JD
00:59:22.720 with a small land owner who trusts you
00:59:26.079 pick up that plot and do one concentrate
00:59:29.599 on that one development design it well
00:59:32.880 uh and price it correctly sell it to
00:59:35.240 your bunch of customers that'll be your
00:59:37.200 first beginning Point once you've done
00:59:39.559 that and you get the confidence and the
00:59:41.319 customers get confidence in you you move
00:59:43.920 to the next you see now lot of these
00:59:45.720 smaller guys did start this way broker
00:59:48.039 started doing uh development but what
00:59:50.839 happened is greed got better than them
00:59:54.280 they suddenly they had so much cash flow
00:59:56.839 one led to the other to the other to the
00:59:58.640 other there was no R also that time and
01:00:00.960 they and then another big problem was
01:00:03.480 don't follow the law I call it simply my
01:00:06.280 building my law no building by
01:00:08.680 law on a small plot we can build X you
01:00:12.440 do X into plus something one more floor
01:00:15.039 extra whatever else so that actually
01:00:18.359 brought into got suggest for me to start
01:00:22.280 this
01:00:23.160 IND in place get appr follow the
01:00:26.160 something in exactly do it once do it
01:00:29.160 properly maybe a 10 Crowes will give you
01:00:31.319 a couple of Crowes that couple of grow
01:00:34.599 you again reinvest it back it'll slowly
01:00:36.920 grow it won't grow overnight but what it
01:00:39.880 does is what will grow in you is your
01:00:42.000 confidence and your brand slowly you'll
01:00:44.440 build your brand and you would suggest I
01:00:45.839 do a JD versus JD is the best JD is the
01:00:49.640 best then only thing in a JD what you
01:00:51.640 need to do is you need to know how to
01:00:53.319 manage people if you're able to know how
01:00:56.000 to handle your landlord his expectations
01:00:58.799 or somebody who's known to you that's a
01:01:01.359 good thing but if you buy yes all the
01:01:03.839 problems also yours the all the benefits
01:01:07.520 also yours but then the number of the
01:01:09.680 the amount of money that you require
01:01:11.160 will be much much more probably you
01:01:13.400 can't really start with 10 crores it it
01:01:16.000 that's too small an amount today but if
01:01:18.039 I want to start a real estate project a
01:01:20.200 fresh will a bank lend to me to do this
01:01:22.520 not to buy land not to buy land but for
01:01:24.960 construction they'll give you but if I
01:01:26.559 find a JD partner who gives the land
01:01:28.760 then they lend money yes for the
01:01:30.200 construction they do lend money yeah so
01:01:32.640 I have a uh different perspective in
01:01:34.559 terms of like we need to know your risk
01:01:37.039 appetite I I I don't think there's a one
01:01:38.680 siiz fits all right like if you ask me
01:01:40.480 land
01:01:41.319 aggregation um has the highest risk but
01:01:43.880 also the highest reward land the the
01:01:46.240 people who buy land early hold on to it
01:01:48.200 that's also different business model no
01:01:49.799 but I'm trying to build active job so
01:01:52.200 yeah for active job I would say like if
01:01:55.119 I if I had at 10 cres I would also look
01:01:57.680 to do a jda with somebody who already
01:02:00.200 has expensive land maybe in a small CBD
01:02:02.839 property you can use your 10 crores as
01:02:05.119 the equity you put in and then get the
01:02:06.839 balance uh as debt from a bank to do the
01:02:09.440 construction financing and then
01:02:11.240 hopefully once you get your approval
01:02:12.599 start selling to start funding the rest
01:02:14.200 of the project you run the reap program
01:02:16.680 wouldn't you want me to invest in some
01:02:18.599 prop tech company and try to build that
01:02:20.640 I would say that I my angle would be
01:02:23.279 more of a operating entity within real
01:02:26.760 estate maybe less of a development
01:02:29.559 entity because it's so competitive and
01:02:32.480 so you know murky also at the at the
01:02:35.599 lower level to get into um so things
01:02:39.760 around maybe energy things around energy
01:02:43.400 for Real Estate For Real Estate
01:02:45.279 elaborate how what would I do see I
01:02:46.960 think that like yeah I mean 30 30% of
01:02:50.440 all emissions is really from Real Estate
01:02:54.000 second largest emitter yeah is the
01:02:55.559 second largest emitter and if we need a
01:02:59.200 transition as a as ay but that's more
01:03:01.440 from Real Estate construction not the I
01:03:03.680 mean yeah but also operating wise
01:03:05.760 there's a lot of consumption that
01:03:07.880 happens right when you're when physical
01:03:10.400 people are using a building whether it's
01:03:12.920 residential or commercial there's a lot
01:03:15.480 of activity that happens waste solar the
01:03:18.359 need for energy I think the Prime
01:03:19.799 Minister said 1 lakh 15,000 homes with
01:03:22.119 solar roof but in a city like Bangalore
01:03:25.799 like where is like I live in this
01:03:27.160 apartment I don't have a roof yeah but
01:03:30.319 no but you have H your Terrace right
01:03:32.079 that can be used to uh Power common area
01:03:36.279 see there are but there are many things
01:03:37.680 it doesn't mean but how is that a
01:03:38.720 business it doesn't mean just the
01:03:40.319 generation it can be management you can
01:03:43.200 build techology the ancillary stuff
01:03:46.200 right you can you can I mean doing solar
01:03:49.680 and building solar Parks is also real
01:03:51.440 estate you know to a large extent I mean
01:03:54.359 it is real estate in fact buy land you
01:03:56.319 have to build on it that have come down
01:03:58.400 to like 13 14% today like if I were to
01:04:00.880 start off with x amount of capital even
01:04:03.319 if I do a PPP and earn say best case
01:04:06.920 scenario 13 14% on a solar farm it
01:04:09.520 doesn't cut it for me I want to build a
01:04:11.760 career in this yeah but it depends now
01:04:14.640 like with you know and that's why I said
01:04:16.440 operating entity because I feel like 10
01:04:18.160 Crow is too small right whether like
01:04:20.920 Building Technology forget operating
01:04:23.119 entity tell me broker tell me something
01:04:26.039 is lowest risk broker you don't need T
01:04:29.079 can I add some technology there because
01:04:31.039 why do I pay 1 2% when I'm buying and
01:04:34.640 somebody pays 2% when they're selling it
01:04:36.720 seems unrealistic that that would be the
01:04:39.319 price after all this price many many
01:04:43.240 this is what he mentioned is K mentioned
01:04:47.359 is a lot of Brokers now have gone into
01:04:50.359 Tech now the the conventional Brokers
01:04:54.200 are sort of become d Amazon all of them
01:04:57.400 have used Tech all of them are sort of
01:05:00.839 going on to different Technologies where
01:05:03.240 they able to generate inquiries from
01:05:05.559 customers answer those queries hire a
01:05:08.119 whole lot of people young kids who can
01:05:10.599 go online get the booking forms and and
01:05:13.880 and actually popularize the product in a
01:05:16.119 much larger platform and that is what is
01:05:18.760 happening because the volumes that are
01:05:20.319 happening today the conventional agent
01:05:23.119 probably today what is doing he or she
01:05:25.160 is doing is is only the bringing a land
01:05:27.839 to the developer and doing a land
01:05:29.640 transaction but the the volumes that
01:05:32.119 come today from a broker where we pay
01:05:35.559 our 2% and I think in our company at
01:05:38.599 least I know that for sure is 50% of it
01:05:41.680 is done through Brokers because they
01:05:44.039 become my selling arm and they are using
01:05:46.520 only Technologies and all new names are
01:05:49.359 there no one single old name in the
01:05:51.720 market that is there and the youngsters
01:05:53.760 are doing it so that is one thing where
01:05:55.319 broke brage happens so brokerage is the
01:05:57.920 easiest business the only investment
01:06:00.160 again is in technology but if you want
01:06:02.680 to become a developer per se no no I'm
01:06:05.640 not saying I'm not saying developer I'm
01:06:07.079 saying I have this much money I want to
01:06:08.880 have a return on the money anything real
01:06:11.760 estate so if you tell me rent office
01:06:13.520 space and make it co-working I can do
01:06:15.119 that no are you saying you want the
01:06:16.480 highest return or are you saying you
01:06:17.760 want to create a business create a the
01:06:20.680 highest return I'll tell you highest
01:06:22.400 return is if you ask me you take that 10
01:06:25.880 invest in um land do some plotted
01:06:28.400 development develop it yourself and sell
01:06:30.200 it I think you'll get the highest return
01:06:32.440 the next highest return would prob
01:06:34.240 probably be with doing a jda with a find
01:06:37.119 somebody who wants to develop the land
01:06:39.480 but why will they trust you if it's your
01:06:41.359 first pro project that you have to have
01:06:43.680 the credibility and the sales pitch to
01:06:45.520 convince them the third less riskiest
01:06:48.480 and probably one with least Capital
01:06:50.160 required is a brokerage firm but then I
01:06:52.760 don't think you you will get your 2% but
01:06:54.920 it's is your network good enough to
01:06:57.359 connect the two people and it's a very
01:06:59.319 very competitive space Not only online
01:07:01.760 what about something reap related so
01:07:03.920 Reap is in the end it's technology right
01:07:06.279 and I look at technology as an enabler
01:07:08.520 so there are so many marketplaces that
01:07:10.440 come up right we've seen our housing.com
01:07:12.359 magic bricks so many of them are now no
01:07:15.160 broker which has become a unicorn but
01:07:17.599 it's a very very competitive space like
01:07:19.559 we see at least like 50 to 60 companies
01:07:21.920 that apply in this space per batch you
01:07:24.640 know so what will separate you from the
01:07:26.520 rest are your algorithm so phenomenal
01:07:29.359 hardly anybody is able to make a dent
01:07:31.000 they can make money they can make a
01:07:32.480 profit they can be unit economic
01:07:34.480 positive but are you going to like how I
01:07:37.760 don't know how many of them I would bet
01:07:39.240 on to become the next unicorn one reap
01:07:41.240 company that you would put your money on
01:07:43.160 if you had to do it all over again
01:07:46.000 today um so we did so we've seen some
01:07:49.359 good success in a couple of them which
01:07:51.359 again one was favorite today I will say
01:07:55.720 store what do they do that's K uh
01:07:59.319 Mahindra mahendran has invested Axel has
01:08:01.839 invested in them so it's for retail it's
01:08:04.880 um uh it's basically sub uh leing a
01:08:08.240 retail space and it's for d2c basically
01:08:11.160 it's for uh d2c Brands come to come uh
01:08:15.720 to come uh online sorry online Brands to
01:08:18.920 go offline and to check the market space
01:08:21.158 so what they do is typical retail leases
01:08:23.279 are like 9 years 6 years they take the
01:08:26.040 space for 3 years or so and then they
01:08:27.920 give it out to brands for say 3 months
01:08:29.839 at a time and they turn around the space
01:08:32.439 for retail say the name again they'll
01:08:34.040 get a lot of traction after this I need
01:08:37.439 get traction light store right so yeah
01:08:40.479 so they've been seeing very good
01:08:41.759 traction it's a brand I didn't it's a
01:08:43.640 concept I didn't think would see the
01:08:46.000 kind of success that it did so it
01:08:47.600 actually started with these two Founders
01:08:49.198 from reap and then Ragu also joined them
01:08:51.439 later um but then I think there hardly
01:08:55.158 any disruption is being seen in retail
01:08:57.560 right now so this is the first of its
01:08:59.040 kind and I think they have the ability
01:09:00.719 to scale up pretty fast and if I were to
01:09:02.759 be starting a new business they say the
01:09:05.198 split today of
01:09:07.560 sales in housing affordable is 27% mid
01:09:12.238 premium is 30 and luxury is above 41%
01:09:16.080 where should I focus I think that number
01:09:18.439 41% luxury is slightly wrong that's a
01:09:21.359 recent number I think I saw this the
01:09:23.000 night Frank report I think somewh it's a
01:09:25.000 little
01:09:26.080 because somehow some of these reports
01:09:28.279 the first half year of 24 whatever it is
01:09:31.560 because that could be little skewed I
01:09:33.960 would say luxury will always be in that
01:09:37.080 15
01:09:37.680 [Music]
01:09:39.120 20% he can vouch for
01:09:41.679 it then this mid segment will be that
01:09:46.960 50% and the balance will be it's how
01:09:50.198 they've defined it I think in that
01:09:51.439 report they said one one CR so luy then
01:09:55.880 everything is mid segment so see that's
01:09:58.960 why they said very
01:10:00.880 clearly that's why it's I didn't see
01:10:03.960 that they put 0 to 50 as low and 50 to 1
01:10:07.280 CR as mid and one now tell me where in
01:10:10.760 your company itself do you get anything
01:10:12.880 less than a CR yeah I mean so I I if we
01:10:16.080 talk about luxury at least the way
01:10:17.679 Builders do it and Uncle you I mean you
01:10:19.400 can let me know but the way we Define it
01:10:22.000 is above 3 crores is probably luxury M
01:10:25.920 between 1.2 cres to 3 cres is upper mid
01:10:28.840 segment say we'll say 75 lakhs to one2
01:10:31.480 CR and uh mid segment is actually 90
01:10:34.840 lakhs to 1.2 crores that's how we Define
01:10:37.800 it and it's very hard to do so-called
01:10:39.880 affordable housing affordable housing is
01:10:41.719 defined at some 45 lakhs plus everything
01:10:44.679 is comes up to almost 60 lakhs with the
01:10:46.840 way land prices are going it's really
01:10:48.360 hard to do affordable housing I think in
01:10:50.000 that same report it'll show that number
01:10:52.159 of affordable housing homes
01:10:56.560 Dro should not go on price it should go
01:10:59.280 on the size of the house so I would take
01:11:03.040 it say 45 Square me house or a 1,000
01:11:06.560 square m house or 100 square me house so
01:11:10.800 it it just you could pay for 10 square
01:11:13.239 me also the same
01:11:15.800 price because the price can always keep
01:11:18.600 changing so I always base it on the size
01:11:21.440 of the house and then of course it's the
01:11:23.880 overall affordability in terms of the
01:11:25.800 ticket size if you ask me what is the
01:11:29.199 fastest selling what is Evergreen is
01:11:32.440 that 75 lakhs to maximum going up to a 2
01:11:35.880 CR it'll get lapped up within no time
01:11:39.760 then after that you move up of the
01:11:43.120 bracket you are going to between say 2
01:11:45.960 cres to 5 cres it's a little more
01:11:49.080 difficult then above that is is for
01:11:51.840 people like nikel Kut so your question
01:11:54.679 is I think think the
01:11:56.760 safest he'll go to that 50 60 CR he's so
01:12:00.440 enlightened that he pass that also like
01:12:03.000 pass the bikes your safest bet is at 75
01:12:05.840 lakhs to 1 CR that so-called mid segment
01:12:09.960 for us I was telling them recently I
01:12:12.159 bought a house yeah how come you're a
01:12:14.040 convert you always said you wouldn't buy
01:12:15.560 a house I think you should make it
01:12:16.800 public that you bought a house just so
01:12:18.760 people have some f
01:12:20.440 he he can be the poster boy for Real
01:12:22.880 Estate now h no so the thing with
01:12:25.920 renting of all the advantages of renting
01:12:29.080 I think there is one
01:12:30.679 disadvantage that you don't have
01:12:32.400 foresight as to when you can move out of
01:12:34.760 the house like I had to move out of this
01:12:37.320 house whereas maybe I would have liked
01:12:39.320 to live for longer in this
01:12:41.840 house and that not having the nuisance
01:12:45.920 value of having to move felt like it
01:12:48.840 made sense to buy one bu house yeah and
01:12:52.960 I think that's the primary reason that
01:12:55.360 security of but let me ask you a
01:12:57.400 question so when you do your stock
01:12:58.600 market analysis right you look at a the
01:13:00.760 health of a company which includes say
01:13:02.880 it's balance sheet and how strong the
01:13:04.760 balance sheet is now for an individual
01:13:07.280 as well we also need to have a strong
01:13:09.199 balance sheet right so- called balance
01:13:10.719 sheet to have that Financial Security so
01:13:12.880 don't you think buying a home adds to
01:13:16.000 the financial strength security balance
01:13:18.639 sheet of an individual I feel like
01:13:21.800 something like gold can give that to me
01:13:24.440 I hate the IL liquid nature of real
01:13:26.880 estate yeah real estate as I told you in
01:13:29.159 the beginning itself it is il liquid at
01:13:31.520 times at times it can just disappear
01:13:34.120 immediately but it is an IL liquid asset
01:13:36.880 it's not something like this will always
01:13:39.800 be liquid probably always not necessary
01:13:43.159 a down time it won't be luxury time
01:13:45.600 whichever time pass heat you must get
01:13:47.639 the right buyer right price and there's
01:13:50.520 a time within which it doesn't happen
01:13:52.679 overnight see to if I've got x amount of
01:13:54.800 stock
01:13:55.639 I want money tomorrow I just call up my
01:13:57.560 stock broker at whatever price you sell
01:14:00.040 it he'll sell it and give me the money
01:14:01.600 in 3 days
01:14:03.520 time liquid I feel like even for this
01:14:05.840 apartment right like the the places like
01:14:09.520 this have fewer buyers as well
01:14:11.719 absolutely so the pricing is a question
01:14:13.760 of if 10 people here decide to sell then
01:14:15.920 everything is ha yeah then the pricing
01:14:17.960 is very arbitrary in nature supply and
01:14:19.880 demand yeah but that's like the the same
01:14:21.639 thing for the stock market yeah okay
01:14:25.120 think stock market has more people like
01:14:27.000 in a certain company if 1 million people
01:14:30.719 decide to sell then it makes a
01:14:33.199 significant difference here 10 people
01:14:35.280 decide to sell I think the price is up
01:14:36.719 but it's more like again then it's like
01:14:38.120 startup investing necess 1 million
01:14:40.120 people 1% holding 1 million shares will
01:14:42.480 make a difference but in the stock
01:14:44.920 market I can buy and sell without paying
01:14:46.840 5% 6% stamp Duty which makes
01:14:50.800 price very inefficient in real estate
01:14:53.320 that's the only thing I would say that
01:14:55.080 that makes it IL liquid is the
01:14:56.960 transaction cost of it and of course
01:14:58.760 your long-term capital gains and things
01:15:01.000 like that yeah taxation is better Equity
01:15:03.520 Market but that brings yeah but the
01:15:06.560 question is how often do you want to
01:15:08.000 flip a house also no that is a Nuance
01:15:10.400 but see that is privilege for me which
01:15:12.320 I'm cognizant to I can afford to buy a
01:15:15.400 house in one two cities and forget about
01:15:19.199 it and say that in a year I'll spend x
01:15:21.760 amount of months here and there but
01:15:25.600 for most people that is not the case
01:15:27.920 you're making a very binary decision
01:15:29.719 should I rent should I buy if I buy a
01:15:32.360 apartment I'm stuck but some people
01:15:34.679 Airbnb it in not India because it's not
01:15:37.199 as mature a market but say in Europe or
01:15:40.159 us it's very mat Market it's a very
01:15:42.880 mature Market to stay in it whenever you
01:15:45.239 want or give it out on rent you yeah I
01:15:48.600 mean it's a business like families um
01:15:51.480 you know retire you know having 6 to8
01:15:53.880 ABNB homes because they making their
01:15:55.679 money work for them without staying that
01:15:58.040 that return on investment really that
01:15:59.560 they're doing in Bangalore itself I
01:16:01.239 think nobody not mature money from
01:16:03.360 buying a property and renting it it's
01:16:05.159 still what 3% rent short St short 4 to
01:16:09.199 5% Max yeah because Airbnb a short stay
01:16:13.239 it is slightly more maybe closer to you
01:16:15.360 don't have occupancy throughout the yeah
01:16:17.840 but overall I would say your returns
01:16:19.920 even if you say a 65 to 70% occupancy I
01:16:22.760 think the returns would be 8 to 9% some
01:16:25.000 sometimes 10% depending on the market
01:16:26.920 because it's short-term rental stay but
01:16:28.480 in long-term rental stay it's what you
01:16:30.080 said between 3 to 4% but if you were to
01:16:32.159 look at the interest rates in inflation
01:16:33.960 right now you account for those two that
01:16:35.719 return is negligible or negative India
01:16:37.840 doesn't work yeah but your underlying
01:16:39.679 value of the asset is appreciated but if
01:16:41.400 you make the assumption that real estate
01:16:43.360 will always keep going up in value which
01:16:45.320 is an assumption I have not
01:16:47.239 made I feel like see that's why I'm a
01:16:50.920 dinosaur I've seen it Grow from here
01:16:54.920 from this thing to going through the
01:16:56.840 roof I never imagined so I said you know
01:17:00.120 if I was Rip van winkled I would just
01:17:02.120 kept this huge tract of land forgotten
01:17:04.679 about it gone to sleep and come back
01:17:07.600 about after 50 years later and the value
01:17:10.440 would have been exponentially more there
01:17:12.880 was no need to go all this circus all
01:17:14.719 the time yeah no need to do Salam to
01:17:16.960 anybody that's why I said land
01:17:18.360 aggregators make the most money but the
01:17:20.400 biggest risk there is if you come back
01:17:22.480 after 50 years don't know whether your
01:17:24.040 land will be encro
01:17:25.760 or your property will be occupied by
01:17:27.480 somebody else or there'll be some other
01:17:29.120 claims that's a b big risk that you take
01:17:31.719 so and another point I'll make is I feel
01:17:35.159 like making money can't be that easy
01:17:38.440 it's never easy like I know in my
01:17:40.280 industry I've been sitting in front of a
01:17:42.199 terminal for the last 20 years every day
01:17:44.199 no holiday all of that when I look at
01:17:47.040 people who made money of holding land
01:17:49.199 and forgetting like some farmer bought
01:17:51.600 20 acres on the border of Delhi at some
01:17:54.480 point of time and left it yeah or
01:17:56.400 cryptocurrency people bought something
01:17:58.120 and forgot about it today it's worth
01:18:00.679 10,000 times what it was I don't know if
01:18:04.560 that doesn't fit well with me that's how
01:18:06.320 people have made money in
01:18:08.280 real few not few but it's risk land
01:18:11.639 owners crazy number of land owners have
01:18:13.880 made incredible amounts of money but
01:18:15.880 there also people who have got screwed
01:18:18.000 and incr that's what I'm saying so wrong
01:18:20.880 claimants yeah there are there are loads
01:18:23.000 of those also which you know that's I
01:18:25.239 think we were talking about a startat
01:18:26.679 where some whatever some percentage of
01:18:29.560 you know all litigations in in uh in the
01:18:32.960 court system are land yes right yes
01:18:35.760 somebody was telling me that 70 to 80%
01:18:38.120 of all court cases are land Rel yeah so
01:18:40.199 it's not there are many
01:18:42.080 people it is highrisk because like you
01:18:44.600 said you anybody can jump and say okay
01:18:46.920 this I own a parcel of this land if you
01:18:48.880 put a fence or a boundary um after your
01:18:52.040 property somebody can come and break
01:18:53.600 that fence or you know break the
01:18:55.159 boundary wall but so I don't think land
01:18:58.600 prices can necessarily go up or should
01:19:00.760 necessarily go up every single year
01:19:02.639 right but if you look at it over a long
01:19:04.360 period of time and if I'll give you a
01:19:06.400 couple of examples like that what uncle
01:19:08.560 was saying when we we start a brigade
01:19:10.120 tars on Brigade Road it was 200 rupees a
01:19:13.520 square foot today that same area could
01:19:16.520 be 55,000 rupees a square foot or even
01:19:18.920 you know 60,000 rupes a square foot and
01:19:21.400 that's like a 250 to 300X jump you know
01:19:24.760 know and and if you look at the stock
01:19:26.159 market or the sensex for the same period
01:19:28.400 it wouldn't have jumped as much there's
01:19:30.159 another example since you are in South
01:19:31.679 Bangalore in JP Naga 7th uh 7eventh
01:19:35.120 phase live we bought land there say 50
01:19:38.040 rupees a square foot today it's 10,000
01:19:40.480 rupees a square foet so it's still a
01:19:42.320 200x jump whereas the sensex for the
01:19:44.800 same period was probably saying 2,
01:19:48.040 66,000 or so and today it's say 80,000
01:19:50.840 so it's just a 13 to 14x so if you look
01:19:53.280 at it over a long period of time I don't
01:19:55.080 think land will ever decline in value
01:19:57.760 okay so for people like us who didn't
01:19:59.639 have money and very recently came into a
01:20:01.440 little bit of money actual money most of
01:20:03.719 it is like
01:20:04.880 virtual like if I have to buy a house I
01:20:07.920 have to buy a piece of land then I have
01:20:09.400 to construct a house if my company earns
01:20:12.560 100 rupees profit I pay 25 rupees
01:20:15.880 corporate tax I'm left with
01:20:18.360 75 promoter of that company I have to
01:20:21.040 take that money out to then buy a land I
01:20:23.639 pay dividend distribution tax on the
01:20:25.480 balance 75 net net I paid 52 53 rupees
01:20:30.000 on my profit already as tax before I
01:20:33.480 take out my money so I'm left with 47
01:20:36.360 rupees on my 100 rupees of earning then
01:20:39.639 I go to a land owner he will say I will
01:20:43.400 not take white money I want some cash
01:20:45.520 component then I have to spend 10 Rupees
01:20:48.840 to convert my white money into black
01:20:51.400 money and then buy the land and then I
01:20:54.960 start building a house it's an extreme
01:20:56.920 case but the tax again you see another
01:20:59.560 thing is nobodys white in no no no in in
01:21:02.760 in land in actually now things have
01:21:05.360 changed because the taxation rate itself
01:21:07.440 has become very reasonable see there was
01:21:10.440 at once upon a time there was that
01:21:12.280 expectation to get black money to get
01:21:14.719 cash but that all has changed
01:21:16.639 drastically and the more the the white
01:21:19.840 economy that you in the better it is you
01:21:22.000 sleep more peacefully you do business
01:21:24.639 properly so but at some point because
01:21:27.239 your money like you said it's paper it's
01:21:29.280 virtual at some point don't you want to
01:21:31.800 make it in like your intangible money
01:21:34.880 tangible yeah because it's the honestly
01:21:37.800 in Bombay the guys who are buying your
01:21:39.600 100 CR apartments are all people who
01:21:41.920 have made money in stock market private
01:21:44.080 Equity guys so at some point don't you
01:21:46.080 want to make intangible tangible because
01:21:48.159 for me I'm like dude I don't know when
01:21:49.719 the stock market is going to crash but I
01:21:51.280 want to make it tangible and transient I
01:21:54.000 want to make can you make
01:21:57.000 it I buy I mean the reate is the best
01:22:00.960 option then at least for there it takes
01:22:03.000 care of your liquidity your transaction
01:22:05.920 costs are quite you get the benefit of
01:22:07.840 the you get a 7% return on a reat if
01:22:10.639 you're investing in a re 90% of the
01:22:14.320 income has to be distributed and it's
01:22:16.920 tax paid and then un unfortunately it's
01:22:19.840 again not tax second time so you get tax
01:22:22.360 paid money into your hands so
01:22:25.120 when the re structure did come in a few
01:22:27.000 years ago into the country I thought
01:22:28.880 that was the best reform that ever
01:22:30.560 happened for commercial property till
01:22:32.719 then we were doing sta sales of office
01:22:35.880 and we used to man even today I'm
01:22:37.920 managing about 3 and a half thousand
01:22:39.639 customers who have invested in me with
01:22:43.000 me and uh it's like an unstructured
01:22:45.639 reate they bought office property only
01:22:48.960 with the intent to get rental income of
01:22:50.920 course they have to go through the whole
01:22:52.600 pain of regist
01:22:55.320 paying the St Duty paying their property
01:22:57.800 taxes and then because we manage it as a
01:23:01.360 unstructured fortunately they don't have
01:23:03.440 to have that problem of vacancy and
01:23:06.440 brokerage and other things but that I
01:23:08.800 don't think there's no other company or
01:23:11.280 maybe I don't know whether you're doing
01:23:12.960 that in your company but what's starta
01:23:15.800 sale or no not sta sales man managing it
01:23:19.719 as an unstructured rate where you Lee it
01:23:21.800 out and then sub we do asset management
01:23:24.679 and all that it's it's very very few
01:23:27.040 exceptional companies are doing that and
01:23:29.040 that's a big win but it's very difficult
01:23:31.600 very very difficult to do it we've
01:23:33.159 stopped doing it now because it's uh you
01:23:35.880 know it's quite difficult to manage
01:23:37.880 people and everything else uh but I
01:23:40.840 believe Reit is something that has
01:23:42.880 changed is going to is a change the
01:23:44.920 landscape of office property it does
01:23:47.440 three things one is it keeps your office
01:23:49.400 building intact keeps it fresh like how
01:23:53.120 you if you walk into any development in
01:23:56.080 anywhere in the world in either
01:23:58.239 Singapore or Hong Kong or Boston New
01:24:00.280 York or London they all even 20 30 year
01:24:03.199 old properties look brand new whereas
01:24:05.840 here after 5 years of you handing over
01:24:08.520 the property they've deteriorated
01:24:11.920 because because of the infighting within
01:24:13.679 the society the management is not there
01:24:16.440 so re does help and I believe if Reit is
01:24:20.719 worked out well there'll be many many
01:24:23.000 office properties par that look brand
01:24:25.360 new even after 30 years of they getting
01:24:27.920 ready you guys have a read they do have
01:24:30.520 yeah but it's not really taken of at
01:24:33.520 scale in India right reats there are
01:24:35.679 three reats three reads now I think that
01:24:39.440 education you know of these buyers and
01:24:43.239 everyone of why the Reit is the more
01:24:45.760 efficient vehicle rather than still
01:24:47.480 owning and saying this is my office
01:24:49.400 floor I own this floor over here is just
01:24:52.239 starting to happen and also a lot of the
01:24:54.400 mutual funds and all of that also now
01:24:57.440 you know putting in money into that
01:24:59.080 directly so if you seen the last it's
01:25:01.560 more institutional than retail right SE
01:25:04.239 thear any retail it's not very because
01:25:07.159 the investors have really not realized
01:25:09.239 the potential of the ret that Ed that is
01:25:11.320 not happen it's happening now if you
01:25:13.000 seen the last like years educate now why
01:25:15.320 are reads good so I think everything
01:25:17.960 that Uncle just said which is you get a
01:25:21.159 tax dividend income you know constantly
01:25:24.760 you have the ability to diversify your
01:25:27.360 risk across like a much larger portfolio
01:25:30.239 and not have any vacancy risk that you
01:25:33.080 might have if you own like a single
01:25:34.719 property or you know a tenant paying
01:25:37.159 that you have a professional management
01:25:39.440 team that is you know managing it making
01:25:41.880 sure that the asset value uh of the
01:25:44.360 portfolio continues to increase it's
01:25:46.719 growing also because they have to also
01:25:49.080 you know continuously buy and acquire
01:25:51.560 New Quality assets if you've invested a
01:25:54.560 quality reat you know that the the type
01:25:57.520 of assets coming in also have been
01:26:00.080 vetted and are actually in the you know
01:26:02.360 Mar locations that will continuously
01:26:04.760 like grow so I think it's like get you
01:26:08.400 know removing that entire murkiness
01:26:12.000 entire amount of like stamp Duty things
01:26:14.920 like that all the taxation that comes
01:26:16.880 with it and the hassle of having to
01:26:20.000 manage it yourself if you're not from
01:26:21.679 the real estate space you just you you
01:26:24.360 know buy that and you can enter as as
01:26:26.840 low as whatever it is right I think it's
01:26:28.840 like th000 bucks 15,000 or something
01:26:31.360 10,000 10,000 bus so if I buy the
01:26:33.280 embassy R I'll make 7% and and the stock
01:26:36.679 appreciation right that it might have um
01:26:40.080 which as a read it's not going to be
01:26:41.719 it's more of like a steady annuity type
01:26:45.400 of income but India will see higher
01:26:49.159 appreciation I would say than than
01:26:51.760 foreign reads or like you know the US
01:26:53.639 reads and things things like that so and
01:26:55.560 what do you think about fractional real
01:26:57.080 estate I have a the same I would say
01:26:59.040 that a re is
01:27:00.480 fractional structured way but you see
01:27:02.560 there's one more Advantage which Karen
01:27:04.639 hasn't told you for a developer see it's
01:27:08.440 we need to turn Capital now if I have a
01:27:11.679 certain amount of critical mass of
01:27:14.480 office real estate or retail real estate
01:27:17.400 I take it into a re now I become the
01:27:20.360 manager of that reat like you are the
01:27:23.159 manager of the re that means you're
01:27:24.560 getting a certain fee for managing I
01:27:27.080 need not be the owner instead of
01:27:28.840 fractionally selling my space to 100
01:27:31.800 people what I do is I can sell a certain
01:27:35.480 Equity a certain percentage of that to
01:27:37.840 the public or to the institutions and as
01:27:40.600 and when I need more and more liquidity
01:27:42.600 like in a listed company I can keep
01:27:44.560 selling my units I get my uh liquidity
01:27:48.080 if I don't want to don't want the
01:27:49.920 liquidity I keep it so that for a
01:27:52.560 developer it's a big advantage as a
01:27:55.440 develop it's like a natural
01:27:57.360 exle for exiting so like you also have
01:28:00.320 exited yeah we we ex I mean we devel is
01:28:03.880 under your name correct see you're the
01:28:05.560 manager still so you whatever happens
01:28:07.880 you're still getting a certain fee uh
01:28:10.440 fee for it yeah so it it has a dual
01:28:13.199 Advantage now fractional
01:28:16.159 ownership there if there was no re that
01:28:18.480 was the only way anybody could
01:28:20.119 participate in commercial real estate
01:28:22.040 but I would say with the re in place
01:28:24.679 this fractional ownership is very
01:28:27.280 difficult to manage you see we as a
01:28:28.880 company have sold undivided share of
01:28:32.159 originator of fraction it's very
01:28:35.400 difficult because what happens is one
01:28:38.199 generation changes another there's a
01:28:39.960 newer buyer the first guy who you sold
01:28:42.400 to you have a relationship the second
01:28:44.800 guy need not know you he would have
01:28:46.480 bought at a much higher price his
01:28:48.239 expectation of it's quite unregulated
01:28:50.280 right now very unregulated very
01:28:52.520 difficult see people management for each
01:28:55.159 property not what these guys are doing
01:28:58.119 it's not a JV when you're selling you're
01:28:59.719 selling to multiple people then what
01:29:03.040 happens is since everybody has bought it
01:29:05.600 with the intent of leasing out you are
01:29:08.480 again leasing it back from them and
01:29:10.159 releasing it to the end user so we make
01:29:13.719 a sort of Arbitrage on that but what we
01:29:16.639 do is we manage the whole system we
01:29:19.000 manage the system in terms of making
01:29:21.600 sure there no vacancies if there's a
01:29:23.480 vacancy we we we make sure that we fill
01:29:26.040 up the uh space almost immediately and
01:29:29.119 if there's a hit we take the hit so what
01:29:31.719 happens to our original investors is
01:29:33.920 they are very comfortable listen I
01:29:35.639 invested X I'm getting so much and my
01:29:38.600 money is growing and then whenever I
01:29:40.400 want to sell obviously property value
01:29:43.000 has gone up and I get some return on
01:29:45.600 Capital also apart from getting the
01:29:47.840 monthly income so it's a win-win for
01:29:50.400 them uh it's only again it's it's a huge
01:29:53.679 amount of of managing people if you have
01:29:56.119 the right mix of customers right mix of
01:29:58.800 people it goes on smoothly goes on well
01:30:01.440 like during covid there were many
01:30:03.520 vacancies my finance guys came and told
01:30:05.800 me sir we are not getting any rent there
01:30:07.520 vacancies what do we do to all these
01:30:10.040 outflow that you have I said keep paying
01:30:14.119 moment you stop paying there'll be panic
01:30:16.560 because the people who have invested are
01:30:19.280 actually invested I know for a fact that
01:30:22.360 some are only living on that the
01:30:24.320 livelihood is running on that moment you
01:30:27.000 stop the flow there'll be such a big
01:30:30.560 Panic each one is going to come and
01:30:32.679 create a scene and they'll be really in
01:30:34.719 sort of panic mod as it is there's Panic
01:30:36.679 going on for lives and this Panic will
01:30:38.960 go on for money I said keep paying so it
01:30:42.159 was a little hole on the pocket but then
01:30:45.800 when things became better rents became
01:30:48.760 better so I had to tell listen we took
01:30:50.760 the hit so now you can't expect the
01:30:52.800 market rent and uh for us so we have to
01:30:56.440 make up that deficit somehow the other
01:31:00.080 people understand that so it's a healthy
01:31:02.600 relationship but I think in the long
01:31:04.760 term best is to do a re structure
01:31:06.920 educate people like Cur said and allow
01:31:09.600 them to invest in the reat instead of
01:31:11.920 Institutions get the retail investors
01:31:14.560 into it it'll be a win-win in fact your
01:31:16.840 reat value will be much higher like
01:31:19.520 strata is a fractional real there's some
01:31:22.440 regulation that has come out that allows
01:31:24.480 no no so sebbi has come up with a small
01:31:26.400 and mediumsized reate and I think it's
01:31:28.800 to get because fractional ownership guys
01:31:31.040 are still in the so-called unregulated
01:31:33.440 space they
01:31:35.199 want they want to get these guys as a
01:31:38.119 small and Med into the sebi regulation
01:31:40.920 so that they can now Monitor and have
01:31:43.400 similar um similar structuring like you
01:31:46.800 know the the sponsor uh uh the sponsor
01:31:49.760 cannot be the same as the manager in
01:31:51.880 terms of facility managing the property
01:31:54.679 uh 90% of the asset has to be leased all
01:31:57.199 that structuring is going to come
01:31:58.800 through which wasn't there for a u
01:32:00.840 fractional ownership uh read would you
01:32:03.800 bet on that business model
01:32:05.960 today because then I can pick I want a
01:32:09.000 part of UB City H yeah versus a reat
01:32:12.480 which has many properties yeah it'll be
01:32:14.320 single single wouldn't because still
01:32:16.840 then limited to one asset versus in a in
01:32:20.080 a in a actual read you know I'm
01:32:22.159 distributed across geography mutual fund
01:32:24.600 and buying a
01:32:25.760 stock it's uh I me to some extent very
01:32:31.159 nicely analyzed some people might want
01:32:32.920 to buy stocks only I like data then
01:32:36.239 right then you might as well just go if
01:32:38.080 you like a certain I can't buy the
01:32:39.719 entire company of which I'm buying one
01:32:41.440 share yeah but what I'm saying is but if
01:32:43.679 you like that particular building but
01:32:45.679 yeah you're talking about would you
01:32:47.320 invest in like a a much smaller business
01:32:50.080 or would you invest in like you know a
01:32:51.920 large Diversified business I think it's
01:32:54.159 less analyzed it no Mutual
01:32:58.880 versus if I'm so confident that the
01:33:02.239 price in UB City will go up 80% whereas
01:33:05.000 bang Bangalore commercial will go up 20%
01:33:07.840 Then maybe I want to take a punt on UB
01:33:10.000 City possible
01:33:12.520 maybe do you
01:33:15.560 think like fractional real estate uh I
01:33:18.440 was talking to wut I called him up today
01:33:20.119 in the morning and I was like tell me
01:33:21.520 some questions to ask which are
01:33:22.760 nonobvious
01:33:23.840 M and he was saying in a few years all
01:33:28.679 real estate will become so
01:33:31.159 commoditized that four walls will be
01:33:33.600 four walls and they're similar to four
01:33:35.520 walls that real estate will become about
01:33:38.760 Services as a play what do you guys
01:33:41.320 think about that like it'll be okay
01:33:43.840 there is kft it won't be about the four
01:33:46.280 walls that I live under but it will be
01:33:48.639 about you add a mall which is attached
01:33:51.239 to this it'll become about the movie
01:33:53.280 theater which is down it'll become about
01:33:55.119 the batmon court about maybe uh event
01:33:59.360 facilities I I mean I would say that
01:34:03.159 where we are as we work and like what we
01:34:05.679 are seeing has in some way shape or form
01:34:09.040 already happened in commercial real
01:34:11.560 estate where commercial real estate is
01:34:12.960 very different from residential it's
01:34:14.400 basically just plain floors okay
01:34:16.719 residential you still have you know
01:34:19.040 design and people have designed homes
01:34:20.960 and things like that differently but
01:34:22.440 offic is large l ly commoditized at at
01:34:26.560 the that grade aish level where most
01:34:30.040 assets are similar there might be change
01:34:32.080 of flow plan and things like that
01:34:34.239 companies or people today are so focused
01:34:37.639 on The Human Experience that they're
01:34:39.480 having in the space um that we see like
01:34:44.760 operators and service you know a service
01:34:47.320 L Hospitality lay on top of it is
01:34:49.480 becoming like a driving factor and we're
01:34:52.199 doing it even on the traditional side
01:34:54.159 you know within our parks to have
01:34:56.320 Community engagement events to have FNB
01:34:58.960 spaces to you know we do our own
01:35:01.280 property management also so that adds
01:35:04.080 that service layer so I think it's
01:35:08.679 definitely you know something where if
01:35:11.520 I'm coming and experiencing that space
01:35:13.920 or I need to live in that location for
01:35:16.760 so long I want an experience also on top
01:35:20.199 of it um and which is why maybe for the
01:35:22.960 previous question also you know like
01:35:25.199 talk about an operating company or like
01:35:27.119 a service layer on top of real estate
01:35:29.159 because I think that's finally where the
01:35:31.440 pyramid is going right is across
01:35:35.000 commercial across residential
01:35:36.880 warehousing data centers even today you
01:35:40.080 have operators across all of these
01:35:41.920 segments and in commercial real estate
01:35:44.040 maybe what we are doing is an operator
01:35:46.679 What Four Seasons or Hilton did and you
01:35:49.239 know H tells is that what manipal is may
01:35:52.360 be doing in hospitals is
01:35:54.280 that you'll want a brand You' want an
01:35:57.280 experience layer you want a service
01:35:59.400 level when you come into it and and uh
01:36:03.320 you'd prefer that over maybe going and
01:36:06.400 trying to do do it yourself or uh you
01:36:09.239 know just kind of going with the older
01:36:11.639 model so would you agree with that so so
01:36:13.840 if I add to that if you look at it from
01:36:15.480 the residential side what what are
01:36:17.080 people looking for once they come to a
01:36:18.639 builder to buy their home uh one thing
01:36:21.320 we adding is say we'll do your Interiors
01:36:23.320 for you right because honestly doing
01:36:25.360 Interiors in India is not like doing it
01:36:27.080 in the US in the US it's like a weekend
01:36:29.920 job you move you go to IKEA you buy your
01:36:32.320 stuff you do it yourself and you're done
01:36:34.080 over a weekend yeah but here it's it's
01:36:36.840 like I need a plumber I need a a
01:36:38.719 carpenter I need a interior designer I
01:36:41.040 need a lighting consultant why is it
01:36:42.560 like that because it is still fragmented
01:36:44.480 it's not very mature and like I was
01:36:46.280 saying contract Contracting in the US is
01:36:48.800 a turnkey TurnKey job and it's like you
01:36:51.840 said it's even more commoditized it's
01:36:53.360 all DIY cuz labor is also um expensive
01:36:57.360 here you can afford to pay for multiple
01:36:59.760 people people's level of customization
01:37:01.760 is also very high so the kind of
01:37:03.840 experiences people are wanting is a
01:37:05.480 One-Stop shop you know I'll buy from the
01:37:07.520 Builder they will also do my Interiors
01:37:10.159 uh if I need to resell the apartment
01:37:11.880 they will also do the rental for me
01:37:14.400 whenever I want to resell they'll manage
01:37:16.480 the property if I have a like like this
01:37:19.000 place if you have a banquet hall they
01:37:20.679 will service it I can have my parties
01:37:23.080 there so everything is becoming much
01:37:25.560 further will they do my will they take
01:37:27.239 care of the tution classes that my son
01:37:29.679 needs we are taking care of enough as
01:37:32.119 Builders but but I'm sure that's that
01:37:35.000 see I'll tell you when we run some of
01:37:36.760 our club houses right so in the club
01:37:38.639 houses you have your Zumba classes you
01:37:41.199 have you can have yoga classes and why
01:37:43.480 not in the tution also if required right
01:37:46.199 now coming back to office like you
01:37:48.159 saying it's more experiential we all do
01:37:49.880 our own facility management of our uh
01:37:52.119 properties and I'm telling my FM guys
01:37:54.520 guys hire some events people into your
01:37:56.440 team because office is just not office
01:37:59.040 people are coming back because of the
01:38:00.480 vibe now how do you create the vibe or I
01:38:02.239 need a brewery or I need different kinds
01:38:04.320 of FNB Services I need to provide a link
01:38:07.679 to Uber or Ola so that Transportation
01:38:10.360 becomes easier I need to have uh comedy
01:38:13.320 nights I need to have music nights and
01:38:15.239 somebody um so is that a good business
01:38:17.960 because you saying in the US everything
01:38:20.080 is TurnKey around inter for construction
01:38:22.480 now for interior if somebody starts it
01:38:24.719 in India yeah there are players that do
01:38:27.400 it but it's just your quality is never
01:38:29.960 it's more expensive can they do over a
01:38:32.000 weekend like in the US no I don't think
01:38:34.320 so why is that labor not FR education of
01:38:39.360 that labor is not there they don't use
01:38:42.360 in
01:38:43.440 decision the customer himself or herself
01:38:46.320 doesn't know minimum what they want so
01:38:49.560 if they're decisive it's that much more
01:38:51.800 easier simpler but like you said you see
01:38:54.520 today even even uh selling a home is
01:38:57.199 just not the four walls because that
01:38:59.800 concept of four walls entering the house
01:39:03.239 underneath the St that concept has gone
01:39:05.599 long ago what everybody looks in for is
01:39:08.960 for experience whether it's office
01:39:11.080 property or for that matter residential
01:39:13.280 property experience in a residential is
01:39:16.239 the Open Spaces the the landscape the
01:39:19.119 facilities that you have and the backup
01:39:22.000 Services whether it's interior years of
01:39:23.800 property management now see we got into
01:39:26.360 this property management long long ago
01:39:28.360 only to make sure that somebody to be a
01:39:31.480 punching bag for the customer and today
01:39:34.480 that's become a huge Topline business
01:39:37.199 and more so in in in in office the Rupa
01:39:41.000 very rightly said we are doing hotelz of
01:39:43.360 all office spaces if people are coming
01:39:45.760 back to work it's because of the
01:39:47.400 activities that we've brought in it's
01:39:49.480 about see today my guys come and tell me
01:39:51.960 listen we need food we need a micro Brey
01:39:55.280 we need all of it so that's how people
01:39:57.440 will come in there not only for the
01:39:59.639 working and plus they they paid well so
01:40:01.679 they can spend that money so that's
01:40:04.360 what's happening today if you don't have
01:40:06.480 all those facilities your Park becomes a
01:40:09.360 complete Flop Show so it's very
01:40:11.639 important to hotze the entire experience
01:40:16.000 and uh that is today it's getting more
01:40:18.280 and more uh demanding so since some of
01:40:20.960 the skyscrapers if you go wherever you
01:40:23.040 go in in the world like all the tallest
01:40:24.639 skyscrapers have a rooftop bar like a
01:40:27.880 fancy pancy Rooftop Bar so when we were
01:40:30.679 doing World Trade Center it was the
01:40:32.159 first in Bangalore it was in malleswaram
01:40:34.040 and it was not known for an office
01:40:36.679 destination people were like why are you
01:40:38.119 doing office here it was the first
01:40:39.840 office building in that location so the
01:40:42.159 way we sort of popularized it was by
01:40:44.080 creating a rooftop bar called high Ultra
01:40:46.040 Lounge which we created to sort of
01:40:48.040 position I mean of course World Trade
01:40:49.400 Center itself has its own positioning
01:40:51.360 but to make it popular with the rest of
01:40:52.920 theity otherwise only the people who go
01:40:54.800 to office they know about it like
01:40:56.760 everybody knows Orion mall or a retail
01:40:58.840 space because you got a million
01:41:00.920 customers a month but office only those
01:41:03.239 10,000 people who work in a particular
01:41:05.520 space might know it so when you do the
01:41:07.679 hospitality element it poshes poshes it
01:41:10.560 up it premiumize the entire building
01:41:12.880 also so like like in the US right
01:41:15.199 wherever you have a Starbucks the the
01:41:17.840 rental value of the of a certain
01:41:19.679 neighborhood might go up in the US
01:41:21.080 Starbucks may not have similar
01:41:24.560 here but it's the same thing wherever
01:41:27.159 you have high FNB lot of you can add to
01:41:30.440 the premiumization of the building
01:41:32.119 itself and people are willing to pay a
01:41:34.840 premium for amenities not willing to pay
01:41:38.760 your occupancy if you don't have it the
01:41:40.800 occupancy doesn't happen the the the
01:41:43.199 client doesn't the first requirement of
01:41:45.239 the client is do you have this this this
01:41:47.719 this this only then they lease out the
01:41:49.280 space from you yeah so so new strategies
01:41:52.000 to have the Le out the fenb first and
01:41:54.760 say okay I have these cafeteria guys
01:41:56.560 coming I have this coffee shop
01:41:58.679 coming so it's not Le out your gym this
01:42:01.679 is the crash player this is the gym
01:42:04.280 operator and so they get an idea of the
01:42:06.480 positioning and then it's easier to
01:42:07.760 lease it out so when I'm in Mumbai right
01:42:10.239 whenever I'm spending time there I see
01:42:12.280 that all the properties are from
01:42:15.520 fragmented developers It Feels Like Only
01:42:20.239 Bangalore developers have been able to
01:42:23.040 go Pan national in a manner
01:42:26.280 whereas Hyderabad ones and Mumbai ones
01:42:29.320 and Delhi ones baring maybe dlf have not
01:42:31.880 been able to why is
01:42:33.520 that so I don't think um too many
01:42:37.719 Builders have been successful going pan
01:42:40.159 India I think have you guys gone pan
01:42:42.360 India we so so we have we look at real
01:42:45.360 estate as a very Regional game because I
01:42:47.400 feel like the further away you move away
01:42:49.080 from home base more leakages harder to
01:42:51.599 sort of mon harder to sort of um oversee
01:42:56.040 um and also each state in India is like
01:42:58.239 a different country the rules are
01:43:00.040 different and there is a bit of learning
01:43:02.119 curve that happens in each state so we
01:43:05.000 have said that we will focus on say
01:43:07.480 Bangalore Chennai Hyderabad um and some
01:43:10.800 of the tier 2 uh cities in those markets
01:43:12.960 and try to go deeper you know get a
01:43:14.560 larger market share in each even the
01:43:17.159 players that have gone so-called pan
01:43:19.199 India it's limited to maybe six or seven
01:43:22.040 cities I don't think you can go to
01:43:23.880 beyond that just because there's a drain
01:43:26.159 on bandwidth on on Time effort so I
01:43:29.599 think it's you can do six to seven
01:43:31.239 cities if you really want to focus as
01:43:32.960 you can name the players like on you
01:43:34.719 know on your hand and who are they they
01:43:37.199 haven't not all of them like succeeded
01:43:39.840 in you should talk about it listening to
01:43:42.199 you first I want is it a factor of who
01:43:44.040 knows which politicians you need to know
01:43:45.800 so many to be B I don't think so not
01:43:48.679 really you have to have the
01:43:50.320 execution capability right like depends
01:43:53.480 on your access to land yes very rightly
01:43:57.400 put my nupa is every city is a separate
01:44:00.239 country when I go to Kerala I said this
01:44:02.719 is a separate country when I go to
01:44:05.119 Mumbai it's a separate if I go into
01:44:06.800 Chennai the old nuances are very
01:44:08.679 different Hyderabad noan is are
01:44:10.960 different but you know we have moved
01:44:12.400 away from Tier Two Cities I've done work
01:44:14.239 in
01:44:15.239 Mangalore yes it's a lovely city yes it
01:44:18.080 deserves some good buildings
01:44:19.599 developments all of it but the the over
01:44:23.119 overall appetite Market is too small for
01:44:26.159 the type of effort effort is the same
01:44:28.520 from licensing to execution to delivery
01:44:31.280 to marketing the effort is all the same
01:44:33.760 but you don't get the volumes now if you
01:44:36.159 go into the larger cities the Metro
01:44:38.199 cities so we have also restricted
01:44:39.840 ourselves to Mangalore Chennai Hyderabad
01:44:42.440 Mumbai NCR now these are the places
01:44:45.440 where the demand is real where you it's
01:44:49.199 always Evergreen there is a you know
01:44:52.679 require requirement that comes in all
01:44:54.880 the time and even the pricing and
01:44:57.480 everything else is can be balanced yes
01:45:00.040 now the only thing is you have to learn
01:45:01.760 the nuances those cities you need not
01:45:05.000 know any politician or an official but
01:45:07.159 you really need to know your business
01:45:09.280 you need to know do a proper Market
01:45:11.480 study and saying which which micro
01:45:13.560 Market at what price your product will
01:45:15.520 sell and you should be fortunate enough
01:45:18.199 to be able to access land because land
01:45:21.320 is a raw material for all of us M now if
01:45:23.639 you don't get land or not don't get land
01:45:25.599 at the right terms I mean I'm not
01:45:27.480 compulsive there's no need for me to do
01:45:29.920 business for the sake of saying I I
01:45:31.760 exist in so and so place like you've
01:45:33.400 gone to Mumbai recently yeah it it has
01:45:35.239 to make Financial sense in fact I see
01:45:38.000 for me also it's not something that I
01:45:40.239 can boast and say listen I'm too
01:45:41.840 intelligent I went to Mumbai no what
01:45:44.400 happens is we started okay there's some
01:45:47.880 person who we knew who really said okay
01:45:50.880 I've got this project here and such a
01:45:53.040 prime location he was my customer in one
01:45:55.639 of my Apartments here in Bangalore and
01:45:57.560 then he came and did his sales pitch
01:45:59.639 then we looked at it then we thought
01:46:01.840 that okay this is doable it was 300,000
01:46:04.760 Square ft in a Pali Hill in Mumbai and
01:46:08.239 we thought that we can't go wrong there
01:46:10.040 I said even if you go wrong it's not
01:46:11.639 going to be a big hit so we started
01:46:14.880 looking at it small so we with the lot
01:46:18.000 of reputation lot of debate lot of
01:46:20.280 thought process we committed and it was
01:46:22.040 a Redevelopment M so really the amount
01:46:24.920 of capital that had to be deployed
01:46:27.040 wasn't that so much that you really
01:46:29.440 could have pun explain Uncle briefly
01:46:32.159 what is Redevelopment Redevelopment is
01:46:34.400 an existing old building where the the
01:46:38.239 building is become old the existing uh
01:46:43.599 people who are the owners of that
01:46:45.360 particular development they call it
01:46:47.000 Society in Mumbai they want a newer
01:46:50.119 place with that much more bigger fac
01:46:52.880 facilities and and and uh probably since
01:46:56.440 the FSI has changed they'll get that
01:46:58.840 much more builtup area extra so that's
01:47:01.639 how the Redevelopment starts so more
01:47:04.840 more Apartments more square footage and
01:47:07.599 most importantly is better Plumbing
01:47:10.119 better lighting system better vertical
01:47:12.560 transportation and better parking so of
01:47:15.760 course they the quality of life improves
01:47:18.599 better facilities also and by being
01:47:21.840 there as the Society they get that
01:47:24.400 incrementally higher square footage
01:47:27.119 which either they can sell back to the
01:47:28.719 developer or keep it for themselves they
01:47:31.440 get a slightly larger home like when we
01:47:34.199 did that Redevelopment in Mumbai I'm not
01:47:36.840 giving one for one then there's nobody
01:47:38.960 is really so it has to be 14 into 3 or4
01:47:43.239 or5 times more so if I've got a 100
01:47:46.920 square meter house if I get 130 or 140
01:47:51.080 square me house my house is going to be
01:47:52.840 become a little larger it's going to
01:47:54.719 become newer with better finishes and
01:47:56.840 better fittings and obviously what
01:47:59.280 happens the other the the sweetener is
01:48:02.639 while this is going to get built I get
01:48:04.480 my rental I move into another alternate
01:48:06.880 accommodation the Builder pays the the
01:48:09.920 the rental and the re uh Rehabilitation
01:48:13.760 cost and all that and they come back the
01:48:15.800 only thing is they have to have the
01:48:17.880 confidence in the developer that he
01:48:19.679 takes it up and completes the
01:48:22.119 development within the stipulated time
01:48:24.239 as per the specifications I have seen in
01:48:27.080 fact I have picked up subsequently many
01:48:29.599 deals have come to me where these
01:48:31.679 Redevelopment projects have started and
01:48:34.679 they've not
01:48:36.360 fructified and now we we've gone there
01:48:38.840 like a white night and tried to save a
01:48:40.719 lot of things so so one project led to
01:48:43.520 the other to the other to the other and
01:48:45.480 now I'm doing some few million square F
01:48:47.400 feet 6 million square ft plus of office
01:48:50.119 and a few million square ft of resident
01:48:53.040 which I never imagined that I could I
01:48:54.800 have to pinch myself every time to
01:48:57.040 remind myself am I really doing this but
01:49:00.199 it is the most difficult territory to
01:49:03.000 operate in why is it the laws are
01:49:04.639 different the premiums are different the
01:49:06.920 approval fees is all huge because unlike
01:49:09.679 in Bangalore we are we are like innocent
01:49:11.560 children here as compared to there you
01:49:14.040 see what happens is the the the there's
01:49:17.040 a some base FSI you have to learn the
01:49:19.080 tricks of the trade and and that base
01:49:21.280 FSI there is either one or 1.25 or some
01:49:25.440 from there it starts then everything
01:49:27.719 else that you build on has to be paid
01:49:30.080 for whether it's premium FSI or whether
01:49:32.239 it's TDR this industry right buying FSI
01:49:34.520 and selling it all that is in Mumbai
01:49:37.199 it's a big industry not only TDR it's
01:49:40.880 it's it's it's also the the the the
01:49:43.119 municipality gets huge this is what I
01:49:45.199 was trying to tell our authorities here
01:49:47.239 you do this premium what happens is
01:49:49.599 you're not doing it for yourself you're
01:49:51.960 doing it for the City because when you
01:49:53.719 are selling premium FSI what happens is
01:49:56.679 the the local body gets a whole lot of
01:49:58.880 money today the Mumbai municipality is
01:50:01.920 the richest they get tens of thousands
01:50:04.560 of rupees as fees and that is plowed
01:50:07.639 back into the infrastructure today if
01:50:09.280 you've got a SE sea Link Road or the uh
01:50:14.080 the the other expressways and everything
01:50:16.599 else and that so many x amount of
01:50:18.320 flyovers it's not that they've gone okay
01:50:20.760 they may be having a certain proportion
01:50:22.440 of loans but the rest of it is all
01:50:24.880 coming from the the money that is
01:50:27.320 generated from all these approvals here
01:50:29.880 they have not learned the game this is a
01:50:31.960 golden opportunity for you you make it
01:50:34.920 viable you will get crores of rupees as
01:50:38.520 money for your Municipal body local body
01:50:40.960 then you don't have to go with the
01:50:42.280 begging bowl and you do apply that money
01:50:44.840 sincerely on to infra so it becomes a
01:50:48.199 win- win so if two things for the
01:50:50.119 government people watching two rules
01:50:51.760 they can change in k what kataka simple
01:50:54.320 thing is I think they are doing it and
01:50:57.280 they should do it quickly is streamline
01:50:59.400 your TDR rules issue see the issue TDR
01:51:02.960 is the fellow who's losing land instead
01:51:05.000 of getting money is gets a piece of
01:51:07.320 paper which is two times the value of
01:51:10.000 his property it's now linked to
01:51:11.400 guideline value it's a it's a windfall
01:51:13.880 according to me the land loser and he
01:51:16.320 should take it gladly only thing is
01:51:17.960 product should be marketable now where
01:51:20.040 the where the land doer lost confidences
01:51:22.199 in like nupa said 8 years it's in libbo
01:51:25.040 because of some stupid thing that
01:51:27.880 happened and it's it's now still in
01:51:30.199 limbo but if they make that product
01:51:32.400 marketable if they allow the uh the
01:51:35.560 buying and selling I mean once the TDR
01:51:37.599 is issued do it sincerely give it as as
01:51:41.079 a it's already the rules are there one
01:51:43.040 is to two times and issue the tdrs as
01:51:46.040 quickly as possible lot of land can be
01:51:49.040 uh uh sort of acquired for Road widening
01:51:52.599 or for any public purpose or whatever
01:51:54.639 else the second thing is bring this Prem
01:51:57.520 mfsi now the debate was always they say
01:52:00.239 no no if I bring premium FSI TDR will be
01:52:02.719 hit or if I bring in TDR premium FSI
01:52:05.960 won't sell I said man let the market
01:52:07.599 forces decide that premium FSI is also
01:52:10.360 based on the guideline value so there's
01:52:12.719 not much of a difference so basically
01:52:15.679 okay they said point6 times of the base
01:52:18.840 FSI whatever is there in that area you
01:52:20.880 can either load now I given them a
01:52:23.119 formula either load TDR and premium so I
01:52:26.760 said do it as point three times premium3
01:52:31.119 times uh TDR do a blend of both or Point
01:52:34.840 2.4 whatever or just leave it for Market
01:52:37.239 forces just say6 time either use TDR or
01:52:40.520 premium uh things will work and uh you
01:52:44.639 know the the municipality will have a
01:52:47.280 lot of money in their hands they'll get
01:52:49.320 liquidity you see till you don't do it
01:52:52.159 you don't know what the benefit is once
01:52:54.520 you do it then you know the benefit and
01:52:57.400 the pleasure that comes very interesting
01:52:59.960 another
01:53:01.000 thing innovation in real estate first
01:53:05.400 principles how an apartment is today I
01:53:07.840 was reading this book Bill Bryson home I
01:53:10.040 don't know if you guys have read it he
01:53:11.719 talks about the evolution of home how we
01:53:14.639 got a toilet how we got a dresser for
01:53:17.880 the first time how did we come up with
01:53:20.280 the concept of a bedroom which is
01:53:21.960 different from a living room why do we
01:53:24.239 have a living
01:53:26.040 room if one were to extrapolate and say
01:53:28.960 the last real innovation in real estate
01:53:32.360 from a structural lens maybe Kuser
01:53:36.119 apartment
01:53:37.239 complexes why has nothing changed beyond
01:53:40.880 that why do we still live in homes with
01:53:43.800 a living room a dining table a bedroom a
01:53:46.320 bathroom and a kitchen all bated with
01:53:50.079 walls why is that what would you want
01:53:52.679 yeah that still works you want it still
01:53:54.840 works right it could be anything right I
01:53:57.639 think a home is like just it's that
01:53:59.679 Marlo's hierarchy of needs right it's
01:54:01.599 like solving for a very basic Primal
01:54:05.599 type of need which is just security
01:54:08.639 feeling safe feeling like you know where
01:54:11.920 you have when you come back from the
01:54:14.639 outside world that you have a sense of
01:54:16.639 security safety so I would say largely
01:54:19.440 it's it's across cultures is very
01:54:22.920 similar if you see Japanese interior
01:54:25.760 architecture to Indian to you know
01:54:28.639 something in the west I mean the
01:54:31.040 fundamental things are always taken care
01:54:32.840 of I want to cook somewhere I want to
01:54:34.239 have somewhere that I can put my head
01:54:35.760 down I need to you know use the toilet
01:54:38.040 now they're different sizes formats and
01:54:40.639 things of that but it's it's just about
01:54:42.599 that security I feel postco you have a
01:54:44.719 new room for offes but there are some
01:54:48.560 yeah but there are some sorry I said I
01:54:50.719 hate that room
01:54:52.800 there are some um Innovations in the
01:54:55.199 sense like we're talking about homes for
01:54:57.040 the Millennials and the Gen alpha or
01:54:59.360 whatever who don't want to cook as much
01:55:01.400 right so then I feel like it's going
01:55:02.960 some of these places where it's um built
01:55:06.360 a suit no kitchen there's a communal
01:55:07.920 kitchen because people want people are
01:55:09.760 lonely right with the with as and when
01:55:12.880 technology is seeping into our lives
01:55:14.679 they're getting more lonely so they want
01:55:15.960 to now create communal kitchen so that
01:55:18.320 they know their neighbors otherwise many
01:55:19.760 times people don't even know their
01:55:20.960 neighbors but in terms terms of
01:55:22.880 apartment in terms of um living room
01:55:25.760 kitchen all that I think it's still very
01:55:28.239 much required people want thaty versus
01:55:31.199 can't it change it can and I think it
01:55:34.079 will over time like she said first of
01:55:35.840 all like kitchen has become like getting
01:55:38.560 more and more like redundant the more
01:55:40.840 and more the youngsters will say man why
01:55:42.639 the hell should I why should I cook okay
01:55:44.960 some people love cooking some people
01:55:47.920 just dwell into that again it's about
01:55:49.920 creativity you love painting you love
01:55:51.960 doing something as you love cooking but
01:55:55.079 otherwise uh generally I would say the
01:55:58.159 everybody so busy in their lives they'll
01:55:59.960 say listen man if if it's a small little
01:56:02.599 space where I can heat up something or
01:56:05.000 whatever else so even I question this
01:56:07.480 you see now our architect used to design
01:56:10.800 every bedroom has to have one toilet now
01:56:13.800 in the 80s when I went to
01:56:16.360 UK in a in a in a what call not even
01:56:20.760 it's even a ro house M there used to be
01:56:23.480 only one toilet and two bedrooms or
01:56:26.000 three bedrooms and here we are supposed
01:56:29.000 to be a very poor Society we can't
01:56:31.639 afford and our homes so what we had we
01:56:35.159 used to I said man if you have a three
01:56:37.079 bed why is it necessary to have three
01:56:39.480 toilets have two three bedrooms and one
01:56:43.000 toilet make the bedroom slightly larger
01:56:45.360 make those two toilet I mean one could
01:56:47.639 be a common one one could be where the
01:56:50.880 where where where the owner of the house
01:56:53.079 or the boss of the house sleeps so that
01:56:55.760 that that we changed that concept what
01:56:57.840 it did is brought made the house
01:56:59.360 slightly more smaller but more usable
01:57:02.079 now if you remove of basically what you
01:57:04.599 want a home for you want to get in you
01:57:06.840 want to have a nice comfortable bed you
01:57:09.320 want a nice comfortable toilet that's
01:57:11.560 that goes is that what you want from a
01:57:13.079 home sir sir for me the most important
01:57:15.679 thing in any home is you have to have a
01:57:17.480 comfortable Le and a good toilet but
01:57:19.840 that's what I was saying what's changing
01:57:21.400 now is lot of my customers want that
01:57:24.119 balcony M they want some space where
01:57:27.199 they can go out take a deep breath so
01:57:30.840 that's a big big difference yeah
01:57:32.440 especially in B because the weather's so
01:57:34.079 good but in a very probably crummy
01:57:37.800 weather you wouldn't want a balcony at
01:57:39.520 all because you can't step out on it if
01:57:41.159 you go into a Dubai which is 52° what
01:57:44.639 will I do with the balcony but uh here
01:57:48.119 we we stopped doing the balconies
01:57:49.679 because again it was about the size of
01:57:51.239 the house m for me as I said it's the
01:57:53.440 size of the house not in terms of
01:57:55.000 pricing but in per square foot but in
01:57:57.040 the overall ticket size of the house so
01:57:59.480 the balcony came that means so many more
01:58:01.239 square footage I'm building so that will
01:58:02.960 C charge the customer that much more yes
01:58:06.079 it will evolve now I don't know whether
01:58:08.960 you can need to have a separate living
01:58:11.480 room and a separate diving room it could
01:58:14.119 be one one one composite space which can
01:58:17.159 be used for double up as both uh it's
01:58:20.360 more so this I want to invite some
01:58:22.239 friends home guests home but then if I'm
01:58:24.199 not cooking at home the question of
01:58:26.320 entertaining them at home unless I'm
01:58:28.119 catering it from outside unless I've got
01:58:30.480 somebody else to come and uh get the
01:58:32.719 food and cater it you see today you
01:58:34.440 swiigy it or you whatever else you do it
01:58:37.239 comes in minutes sorry another Trend
01:58:39.000 with the luxury homes is the two
01:58:40.560 kitchens right the show kitchen for the
01:58:43.440 guest and then the one for the staff or
01:58:46.320 or if you're catering a lot to for the
01:58:48.520 Caterers to come in what do you think is
01:58:49.920 working more in society today say his
01:58:51.719 dad is projecting X your dad is
01:58:54.239 projecting
01:58:55.920 y like I have this really favorite
01:58:59.760 philosopher psych psych psychiatrist his
01:59:02.840 name is Yung okay he says that we are
01:59:04.960 all like wine we are a vintage of the
01:59:07.880 year that we are born in and hence what
01:59:10.719 we believe in changes like ifan Uncle
01:59:13.960 believes in a certain thing because he
01:59:15.679 was born on a certain year I was born in
01:59:18.079 86 so I believe in some things about
01:59:20.320 life so does Curren and so do you
01:59:22.960 what kind of projection is working as a
01:59:26.560 factor towards for the lack of a better
01:59:29.760 way of putting it getting more deals
01:59:31.280 done today mhm so I think there's no
01:59:35.040 right or wrong according to me there's
01:59:36.719 no right or wrong I think the way his
01:59:39.079 dad is is a reflection of his
01:59:40.440 personality and the way my dad is is a
01:59:42.119 reflection of his and that could be
01:59:43.560 because of how like you said they've
01:59:45.320 been brought up the value system of the
01:59:48.000 family Etc now I think the way you run
01:59:50.880 your company will also attract certain
01:59:52.719 kinds of investors okay or home buyers
01:59:56.040 like everybody has a reputation in the
01:59:58.320 end you know it is some people will look
02:00:01.159 for certain attributes from a customer
02:00:03.679 perspective okay I'm putting my life
02:00:05.280 savings you know I want to go with a
02:00:09.000 reputed maybe conservative Builder but
02:00:12.000 if it sometimes if you're looking at a
02:00:13.920 more luxury product or if you're looking
02:00:16.119 for different aspects so I just think
02:00:17.719 whoever you are will attract different
02:00:19.679 segments and different kinds of
02:00:21.000 investors also maybe certain things are
02:00:24.239 uh risk taking is associated more with
02:00:27.239 say flashiness for some some cases so
02:00:29.719 you'll attract a different type of
02:00:31.079 investor and customer I feel I I think
02:00:32.840 that's true I mean it's also who do you
02:00:34.199 want to partner with right like I will
02:00:36.880 if if I'm maybe up against someone super
02:00:39.280 obnoxious or you know extremely flashy I
02:00:43.079 I will automatically retract and not try
02:00:46.079 to try to avoid partnering with that
02:00:48.760 person at you know at maybe like all
02:00:51.159 costs but there are some people who are
02:00:53.159 attracted by that and some people your
02:00:55.400 dad was able to handle Adam Newman like
02:00:57.520 not everybody can handle an Adam Newman
02:00:59.320 tell us more about Adam Newman So Adam
02:01:01.599 Newman stayed with curan in their house
02:01:04.040 for a week I heard I mean I I won't say
02:01:07.599 too much but and his new company is kind
02:01:10.040 of bringing together home in a different
02:01:12.159 manner right like adding a a service
02:01:16.360 layer or like a brand trying to add a
02:01:18.800 younger brand maybe to residential real
02:01:21.040 estate in the the US and you know
02:01:23.320 leveraging technology and um doing all
02:01:26.400 the engagement stuff that we spoke about
02:01:29.119 Adam is uh I would say the greatest
02:01:33.520 salesman in the world that that's what I
02:01:35.480 was you know telling you as well where
02:01:37.440 he had uh uh it's one of those few
02:01:41.320 people that you meet I think like in the
02:01:44.040 world where you can feel the energy like
02:01:47.079 you know from having a conversation with
02:01:50.840 him or you can you know you can you can
02:01:53.440 feel that there's like some amount
02:01:56.239 of uniqueness in in in that individual
02:01:59.920 and there's you know I think his his
02:02:02.639 ability to think huge and actually take
02:02:05.880 that risk was something I had never seen
02:02:08.119 in many you know people and got to meet
02:02:10.599 a lot of people of like that caliber I
02:02:13.280 would say um so very few have like stuck
02:02:16.079 with that nature but do you find
02:02:18.920 similarities between your dad and Adam
02:02:20.639 Newan I think think so little I mean
02:02:24.119 aiser little bit there from a
02:02:26.400 risk-taking perspective 100% 100% And
02:02:30.079 and he's good like a Visionary
02:02:31.920 perspective
02:02:33.199 also definitely inherited passed on to
02:02:37.199 you and your
02:02:38.679 brothers I don't know some I would say
02:02:41.280 split amongst three of us I think who
02:02:43.800 got what who's the biggest risk taker in
02:02:46.599 your
02:02:47.400 family I would say that's still me I
02:02:50.400 feel on the risk Tak
02:02:52.480 side uh you know on the storytelling
02:02:55.000 side maybe my youngest brother is like
02:02:57.199 you know has that humor and and that
02:02:59.920 ability to build a quick relationship I
02:03:03.400 think my Middle Brother is like a lot
02:03:06.119 more structured ad is like a lot more
02:03:08.040 structured and like process driven so I
02:03:10.760 would say it's it's split I don't think
02:03:12.360 either any of us have got all of the
02:03:15.400 quality qualities and like Yeah and I
02:03:18.000 don't think that will happen and our mom
02:03:19.719 has actually influenced us a lot as we
02:03:22.400 were growing up you know we we actually
02:03:25.239 grew up with I mean my my parents got
02:03:27.520 divorced when we were like you know 16
02:03:29.440 so a lot of our upbringing was actually
02:03:31.360 also with my mom so our our real like
02:03:35.520 experience or at least mine and ad's
02:03:37.800 real experience with my dad to in a
02:03:40.599 close proximity has been like post
02:03:43.239 College more from a work
02:03:46.880 work
02:03:48.440 environment um not that it wasn't there
02:03:51.360 before but I would say real close
02:03:53.000 quarters and like learning and all of
02:03:55.559 that was would probably be in the last
02:03:57.119 like 10 15 years how is the relationship
02:03:59.480 between you and your sister sister's
02:04:02.400 very good um I think when we grew up
02:04:05.599 this regular fighting over who has
02:04:08.280 control over the remote what do we watch
02:04:10.360 all the silly stuff who goes to the
02:04:12.040 bathroom first but I think from a work
02:04:14.880 perspective we went to the same colleges
02:04:16.920 in the US somehow I just older sister so
02:04:19.559 I just had to follow her footsteps for
02:04:21.040 the most part till grad school but I
02:04:24.400 think work-wise touchwood we haven't had
02:04:28.040 any sort of arguments in all these years
02:04:30.480 but I also think um that's because we
02:04:32.960 have completely different domains she
02:04:34.679 doesn't get involved with what I do and
02:04:36.400 I don't get involved what she does but
02:04:37.880 we have a need to know on what's
02:04:39.679 happening in both the
02:04:41.400 spaces but yeah right now if there ever
02:04:44.880 was something couple of times when
02:04:46.920 there's been a decision that both of us
02:04:48.559 have an opposing view we just have to go
02:04:50.360 talk to my dad and he of sorts it out
02:04:53.079 and I think going forward it will rest
02:04:56.159 with us to have the emotional maturity
02:04:58.440 to make sure we resolve it in a amicable
02:05:02.280 way for a lot of women who are watching
02:05:05.040 this
02:05:06.280 show
02:05:07.960 uh gender roles in society have changed
02:05:11.119 today drastically uh man is no longer
02:05:13.760 the provider woman is no longer the
02:05:15.800 comforter or uh the way in which each
02:05:19.360 partner used to compromise has changed
02:05:23.639 flipped for
02:05:26.000 somebody who is an operator of a company
02:05:29.920 as large and successful as
02:05:32.880 yours is that burden born by your
02:05:36.599 marriage in some
02:05:39.040 way
02:05:41.880 um what burden are you refering to the
02:05:44.440 the switching of the roles yeah it's not
02:05:46.719 easy to some extent see if I had a if I
02:05:49.960 had another if if my husband was also
02:05:52.840 heading a large public listed entity I'm
02:05:55.400 not saying the marriage would sort of
02:05:57.079 suffer for it but maybe the children
02:05:58.719 would because both of us traveling both
02:06:01.159 of us not being there I think the
02:06:03.800 children would suffer so right now I
02:06:06.719 think see in many marriages the woman is
02:06:09.239 taking like 80 to 90% of the household
02:06:12.040 burden and the kids and the work and
02:06:14.880 everything I think initially when the
02:06:17.040 kids were young it was still I was
02:06:19.280 handling it but now after being married
02:06:21.960 for you know almost 14 years we've had
02:06:24.639 to sort of divide up the
02:06:25.679 responsibilities and it has to be 50/50
02:06:28.040 I cannot I'm not able to if I have to
02:06:29.800 travel for Road shows I have to go if I
02:06:31.920 have to travel for conferences I have to
02:06:33.599 go but we try not to both go at the same
02:06:36.400 time so there is a given take I can't be
02:06:38.840 like my career is more important than
02:06:41.119 yours because everybody has a role to
02:06:43.280 play and everybody has um something they
02:06:45.920 feel that they need to contribute to
02:06:47.440 this world and just larger doesn't mean
02:06:50.000 more important also you know just
02:06:52.119 because you know my my husband is not
02:06:54.639 not to you guys but yeah you live in
02:06:57.199 society yeah and Society projects their
02:07:00.719 opinions either vocally or
02:07:02.760 subconsciously one way or the other so
02:07:05.520 no I mean no opinions given to my face
02:07:08.400 but I would have to say that my husband
02:07:10.320 is probably one of the most secure men
02:07:12.400 Indian Indian males because at some
02:07:15.079 point I mean it is it is a known fact
02:07:16.960 that probably obviously he's a single
02:07:19.000 entrepreneur this is a public listed
02:07:20.719 entity yeah I probably make more than
02:07:22.559 him so not many men would be comfortable
02:07:25.719 it takes a very evolved and secure
02:07:27.400 person to be comfortable with it and I
02:07:29.480 happen to have found one of them I've
02:07:31.199 met him great guy and you guys do all
02:07:33.599 these like healthy things together and
02:07:35.199 all right we used
02:07:36.719 to for 40 km our first date was playing
02:07:40.719 basketball together so I think there was
02:07:42.840 a love for sport uh that was there but
02:07:46.280 uh he
02:07:46.870 [Music]
02:07:48.079 does you really have to is that
02:07:50.920 important the important thing is we went
02:07:52.920 on the second date she cycled like some
02:07:55.559 100 km ran for 20 what is that
02:07:57.880 competition so that's the Iron Man yeah
02:08:00.040 you did the full thing right or how I
02:08:01.520 did the full Iron Man swimming cycling
02:08:03.719 and running how much of each 3.8k Swim
02:08:08.000 180k Bike and a 42k run after that and
02:08:12.079 you have to do it within a certain time
02:08:14.199 period in my race it was within 16 hours
02:08:16.280 or so and going back to your original
02:08:19.159 first question right like this this
02:08:21.719 thing of being given things on a silver
02:08:24.000 platter one of the reasons I'm Into
02:08:26.199 Fitness is because Fitness is not can't
02:08:28.520 be given to you it has to be earned and
02:08:30.679 nobody can take it away from you nobody
02:08:32.440 can say oh she became an Iron Man
02:08:33.719 because she's her father's daughter you
02:08:35.480 have to work hard for it and it comes
02:08:37.760 with certain characteristics right it
02:08:39.520 comes with okay I'm not disciplined all
02:08:41.639 the time so but during that training
02:08:43.679 time I had to be disciplined I had to
02:08:45.520 work hard I had to have good time
02:08:46.800 management skills I had to give up a lot
02:08:49.320 of uh fun things because you're such a
02:08:51.880 good friend of mine I'm going to push
02:08:53.079 you a tiny bit sure do you know when you
02:08:55.719 feel strongly for something yeah of all
02:08:58.760 the things we've spoken about you
02:09:00.280 brought this up yeah and when you're
02:09:03.119 feeling about what you're talking about
02:09:04.880 there's a tiny tinge of an accent tiny
02:09:07.760 tinge of a accent accent like what what
02:09:10.679 else I just heard it but why did you
02:09:12.840 bring this part up amongst all the
02:09:14.639 conversations we had till now uh because
02:09:17.760 it tied back with what the what we spoke
02:09:19.920 about first but because I'll tell you it
02:09:21.679 has become a part of my identity almost
02:09:24.079 because I go around talking about it so
02:09:26.360 much um and it's become a part of my
02:09:28.400 identity and it's something I sort of
02:09:30.400 had to fight for because what has become
02:09:32.199 a part of your identity this becoming a
02:09:34.520 triathlete it's very much part of my
02:09:36.639 identity now um and is it also because
02:09:40.639 it gives you validation in a domain
02:09:42.719 where your family does not exist at all
02:09:44.599 yeah possibly like it's it's my space
02:09:46.960 where I'm not you know I I'm not riding
02:09:49.880 on the coattails or success of my father
02:09:52.800 and it has to do every and it has
02:09:54.280 everything to do with my abilities and
02:09:57.199 qualities and nothing to do with anybody
02:09:58.760 else and it goes back to the original
02:10:00.520 thing of wanting to prove yourself
02:10:03.520 sometimes as worthy of being in a
02:10:05.400 certain position and a certain level so
02:10:08.040 it it does I've also thought about it a
02:10:10.119 lot um and also sometimes people have
02:10:14.599 sort of said oh where does she have time
02:10:16.400 to like I've been spoken to in public
02:10:19.280 settings you know where do you have time
02:10:21.079 to run your company if you're running in
02:10:22.480 the park all the time so I have to come
02:10:25.280 back and be like I run way before you
02:10:26.960 wake up so don't worry about it but yeah
02:10:29.920 I felt like I had to fight a lot I know
02:10:31.840 what I went through to do that you know
02:10:33.679 it's um you had to give up a lot and
02:10:35.719 then even my dad would be like focus on
02:10:37.800 your work why are you spending time on
02:10:39.559 Triathlon training that he must be more
02:10:41.599 worried for you yeah came out of concern
02:10:43.920 I don't know but of course now you know
02:10:46.440 he's happy about it but there were a lot
02:10:47.800 of anciliary benefits even from a work
02:10:50.440 perspective for me because of that
02:10:52.360 unfiltered what do you dream
02:10:54.520 about you don't have to be so
02:10:57.360 unfiltered
02:10:59.079 professionally I'll keep it across the
02:11:01.520 Sens of board
02:11:04.040 um I have two dreams actually you know I
02:11:07.320 have two dreams one is of course on a
02:11:09.920 professional side I'll talk about it
02:11:11.320 from a professional side um one is of
02:11:14.480 course taking this company to being not
02:11:18.159 just you know big I don't know bigest is
02:11:21.599 my dream but definitely the best and how
02:11:23.840 we can go about doing that but sometimes
02:11:27.119 I I also wonder you know at the end
02:11:29.760 there it is you feel like you're on a
02:11:31.719 hamster wheel it's quarter to quarter
02:11:33.800 year on year it just never stops you
02:11:36.760 know every every day it just never stops
02:11:39.320 and I'm like at the end of it what is
02:11:41.400 the purpose to all of this you know that
02:11:43.639 getting a little philosophical what is
02:11:45.280 it so I have F I have thought about that
02:11:49.280 a lot too and I've realized realiz that
02:11:51.719 the purpose of life is that there is no
02:11:54.079 purpose it is whatever you make of it
02:11:56.119 right there is no purpose to life like
02:11:57.880 nistic yeah you wanting to be the
02:12:00.520 biggest is okay you not wanting to be
02:12:02.400 the biggest is okay you say inherently
02:12:04.719 we all want to be better than our peer
02:12:06.199 group in whichever way but that is to
02:12:08.679 satisfy the ego right like if you let go
02:12:11.800 of everything and you really think like
02:12:13.639 what is important to you so I actually
02:12:15.639 listed out a few things I said okay how
02:12:17.559 do I spend my week what is important to
02:12:19.239 me who are the people important to me I
02:12:21.320 think we all finally drill it down to
02:12:23.320 boss if the relationships around us are
02:12:25.159 not okay like parents kids two three
02:12:27.719 close friends siblings we are not okay I
02:12:30.599 don't think we'd be happy people we'd be
02:12:33.840 I don't think success can come at the
02:12:35.440 cost of say relationships but when I was
02:12:37.599 drilling down my week I realized that
02:12:39.480 the time I spend with my my my kids is
02:12:42.079 12 and a half% of my week which is a
02:12:44.880 really small amount for um how important
02:12:48.880 they are to me so it was almost
02:12:50.559 inversely proportionate like the amount
02:12:52.440 of time I spent with my mom and my dad
02:12:54.040 and my kids is inversely proportionate
02:12:56.559 to how important they are to me so I was
02:12:58.639 actually thinking you know is this what
02:13:01.040 is the purpose of what we are doing all
02:13:02.920 the time to be on this treadmill and not
02:13:05.159 have time for the people we love the
02:13:06.520 most so sometimes I'm like you know what
02:13:08.840 you should just go and be on a beach and
02:13:10.800 just relax with the people around you
02:13:12.960 but that is but I don't know if that
02:13:14.599 lasts too long there because inherently
02:13:16.760 I am also very competitive I am
02:13:19.280 ambitious um so yeah so for me for the
02:13:22.280 company right now it's only growth with
02:13:24.119 thinking of growth but sometimes when it
02:13:25.960 gets a lot long days you don't see your
02:13:29.159 kids for a while then you think hey are
02:13:31.000 we on the right path and you keep
02:13:33.040 flipping between that and this there's
02:13:34.520 no choice I'm on this path I've chosen
02:13:36.599 this path and this is my path but it's
02:13:38.679 to keep understanding what is important
02:13:40.840 and coming back to what is important
02:13:43.239 very honest and nice no very correct I
02:13:45.520 mean all your thoughts are very relevant
02:13:47.360 very true right you guys want to take a
02:13:49.599 break before the next part yeah
02:13:51.679 no I think now I have to run huh
02:13:54.679 whenever you run we'll continue on yeah
02:13:56.599 yeah yeah no rush a few moments later
02:14:00.559 okay we're back yeah started so ifan
02:14:03.920 Uncle I wanted to ask you first about
02:14:05.840 malls you guys
02:14:07.719 started Forum mall where I used to go in
02:14:10.440 kangla back in the day the only place
02:14:13.079 with a PVR
02:14:15.239 theater for somebody starting off in the
02:14:17.960 real estate industry can you explain the
02:14:20.520 financial of a mall does it make sense
02:14:24.239 how important is a multiplex to a
02:14:27.400 mall see uh apart from the financial
02:14:31.280 sense as I said the creativity is what
02:14:34.360 gets us I in one of my
02:14:37.800 holidays travel to South Africa Durban
02:14:42.760 Cape Town all these cities and I saw
02:14:45.239 these small size
02:14:47.880 malls where you you had the multiplex on
02:14:50.639 top even even got the good fortune of
02:14:53.239 even going to cinema there and overall
02:14:56.719 look feel the entire size was looking to
02:14:59.920 me as very doable in our country in our
02:15:03.040 cities rather than what malls you used
02:15:05.480 to see in the US of course Dubai didn't
02:15:07.440 exist at that
02:15:09.079 time so one thing led to the
02:15:12.920 other came back to Bangalore I had tied
02:15:15.639 up this land next to my Prestige
02:15:17.719 Acropolis where I had signed up with
02:15:19.880 them to do either an office space or to
02:15:22.000 do one more residential
02:15:24.480 development and those days we had what
02:15:26.719 is called the Urban Land cealing Act can
02:15:29.800 you explain what that is that is
02:15:32.199 promulgated by Madame indraa Gandhi
02:15:34.400 those years to say anybody who owns more
02:15:38.079 than thousand square meters of land had
02:15:40.719 to surrender that land to the government
02:15:43.119 that was excess land okay there were so
02:15:45.679 many exemptions either you got exemption
02:15:47.719 for group housing or pertinent land so
02:15:50.679 lot of of people got exemptions but then
02:15:52.559 it used to be a very very difficult and
02:15:54.719 very tough one to do any large or
02:15:57.239 imaginative
02:16:00.559 project just things being whatever one
02:16:03.920 day they decided that this was a
02:16:05.800 Draconian law and really did not lend
02:16:08.679 itself for development they abolished
02:16:10.599 that act so it was there from
02:16:13.159 1976 to about 1999 almost 20 years plus
02:16:19.719 the Act was there and then that stunted
02:16:22.040 growth cut to to that late '90s the her
02:16:26.880 Land cealing Act got abolished once that
02:16:29.760 Urban Land sealing act got abolished
02:16:31.840 suddenly we were like prisoners out of
02:16:34.599 jail we became we could sort of imagine
02:16:38.920 anything and work out
02:16:40.718 something so I went back to my land
02:16:42.920 owners I always had this desire contrary
02:16:45.718 to my like you said now difference of
02:16:47.959 opinion my brother always was against it
02:16:50.120 no it won't work work in India our
02:16:52.359 people are very different they won't
02:16:53.879 know how to use it I don't know whether
02:16:56.160 revenues will come and I was like hell
02:16:59.040 bent on doing it so in fact he even
02:17:02.799 brought
02:17:04.120 a real estate professional CB who said I
02:17:08.478 sir I'll get Lee this you build an
02:17:10.200 office space here Lee it out for you
02:17:12.398 almost instantly I said I've done many
02:17:14.200 office spaces but I don't want to do
02:17:15.920 this I want to do a
02:17:17.679 Mall fair enough we deployed the
02:17:21.120 architect gave the briefing and it
02:17:24.120 sometimes you know when some good winds
02:17:26.599 over or a good idea winds over not such
02:17:29.240 a good thing so we went ahead that's one
02:17:31.638 great thing about us is there's no
02:17:33.519 finally if it's had to go on there is
02:17:36.318 support so we got the architect got him
02:17:39.359 to design it and then finally we
02:17:41.478 discovered that you can't build a
02:17:43.558 multiplex on the upper floors of a
02:17:45.920 building it had to be only on the ground
02:17:49.318 floor then the next next Journey started
02:17:51.799 it was I know during Mr krishna's rule
02:17:54.000 as a chief minister we went to them
02:17:56.718 cinematographic tact has to change the
02:17:58.638 old world has changed there multiplexes
02:18:00.718 coming up everywhere and you can't have
02:18:03.280 the prime because when my architect gave
02:18:05.200 me the first design the cinema was on
02:18:07.359 the ground floor I was a gust I said how
02:18:09.478 is it that you guys have put it on the
02:18:11.280 ground floor this is the most premium
02:18:13.398 space then he said sir please read the
02:18:15.760 act when I read the act the rules I said
02:18:18.638 okay we'll have to have this the rules
02:18:21.040 Rewritten so fortunately we had a
02:18:23.478 government that was a little proactive
02:18:25.879 that listened and then they asked us to
02:18:29.439 write down the rules frame it the way
02:18:31.599 and today the rules in the
02:18:33.000 cinematographic ACT what is there are
02:18:35.558 the ones that is written by us except
02:18:38.120 that when they brought the draft rule
02:18:39.718 again instead of writing Multiplex they
02:18:42.080 had written IMAX then again I had to
02:18:43.920 beat my head on I said no it's not M
02:18:46.959 IMAX it's IMAX is a projecting system
02:18:49.398 and Multiplex is a group of Cinemas so
02:18:53.558 got that also done in the meanwhile I
02:18:55.799 had got my plan approved as Auditorium
02:18:58.398 the Lord did not sort of stop us from
02:19:01.679 getting auditoriums done an auditorium
02:19:04.439 can be a place where you could have
02:19:05.718 meetings or you could have had weddings
02:19:08.000 or whatever else but you the as far as
02:19:10.398 Cinema was concerned you couldn't have
02:19:12.160 it so we went through that process got
02:19:15.080 those change changes done in the law and
02:19:17.718 then of course we got some external
02:19:19.478 consultancy we got an architect from the
02:19:21.599 US who came and gave us the overall
02:19:23.439 thing and at that time this pbrr was
02:19:28.080 chasing me he came to know that Prestige
02:19:30.959 is going to build a multiplex in
02:19:33.398 Bangalore and then he sent a missile to
02:19:35.840 me an emissary and then we started
02:19:37.599 talking you ask me what is the return in
02:19:39.879 a in a in a in a mall I think if you do
02:19:42.558 it well you'll get a 18 20% return on
02:19:45.120 your investment off the bat yeah you and
02:19:47.959 if you don't get that there's no sense
02:19:49.439 in doing it and if if you manage it well
02:19:51.760 you can probably do much better but we
02:19:54.240 honestly didn't know what was going to
02:19:55.640 hit us so uh we we we we opened this uh
02:20:00.080 Mall in the year
02:20:02.399 2004 uh February 2004 unfortunately I
02:20:06.560 would have been happier because I lost
02:20:08.160 my dad in January 2004 so my dad would
02:20:11.640 have been the happiest that day when I
02:20:13.280 gave a speech also I was I said my dad
02:20:15.160 is somewhere looking from top but just
02:20:17.439 about a month later we opened that mall
02:20:21.439 the cinemas opened in August
02:20:23.800 we honestly we did not know what hit us
02:20:26.960 we used to get 100,000 people 70,000
02:20:31.200 people in a day footfall it was Madness
02:20:34.560 because people hadn't seen uh this sort
02:20:37.680 of organized retail because initially
02:20:40.359 they didn't know what a food cour you
02:20:41.680 know to do a food court I had to
02:20:43.080 convince internally I gave that to my
02:20:45.280 brother-in-law I said man you take the
02:20:47.040 space you do the food Cod but then he
02:20:49.560 said you know he was comp pring some
02:20:51.680 that that business some few thousands I
02:20:53.560 said list it's something very different
02:20:55.280 you haven't understood it so anyway
02:20:57.399 finally we did it and it's no looking
02:20:59.960 back that was and that to those days it
02:21:02.760 was just a
02:21:04.040 350,000 Square ft uh space that is the
02:21:08.760 leible space the rest of it with K
02:21:11.800 because my first brief to my architect
02:21:13.600 was because I used to suffer go to a
02:21:16.280 cinema you never used to get
02:21:18.120 parking you get to a re Cinema you had
02:21:21.000 to Lally struggle to park your car so I
02:21:23.200 said first give me the parking then give
02:21:25.720 me the cinema I think okay it's uh 20
02:21:29.160 years
02:21:30.479 uh but you see there's no looking back
02:21:33.399 so many more malls in the city got built
02:21:35.760 so many more malls in the country got
02:21:37.640 built it was it became a sort of a trail
02:21:40.280 baser and they have now people who are
02:21:42.080 doing much larger more bigger formats
02:21:45.240 now the whole look and feel is very
02:21:46.920 different because the what was relevant
02:21:50.240 then 20 years ago is not relevant today
02:21:52.640 today it's all about experience it's all
02:21:55.880 about uh you know more food and beverage
02:21:59.680 more entertainment and of course a bit
02:22:02.439 of shopping or shopping complement it
02:22:05.200 but then the whole formatting has
02:22:07.560 changed and now we're building another
02:22:09.760 10 11 malls as we go along another 11
02:22:12.240 million square feet for someone starting
02:22:13.880 off good thing to explore if they can
02:22:16.040 conceive raise funding and build them
02:22:17.840 allall Phoenix has done it Phoenix
02:22:19.960 wasn't in the the in the in the Rader at
02:22:23.520 all and they they they were not
02:22:25.760 retailers but they did it they've got
02:22:27.640 somebody to fund them they and I think
02:22:29.840 they've done a brilliant job so I think
02:22:32.000 if you look at the mall operators it is
02:22:34.040 Phoenix who's the largest today and of
02:22:36.600 course Nexus is there they more
02:22:37.960 financial they bought all the so Nexus
02:22:40.479 reat is there which is large Prestige
02:22:43.200 and then afterwards Brigade has also
02:22:45.000 done some mall that's what I was asking
02:22:46.520 nupa what made you build the first mall
02:22:49.560 maybe a diversity yeah so maybe some
02:22:52.080 change I think the operating entity also
02:22:54.600 is very crucial right to know have that
02:22:57.040 expertise of leasing I think my dad went
02:22:59.720 to Japan saw raponi Hills and you know
02:23:03.080 the whole mixed use Township concept so
02:23:05.800 I think he was quite he he thought that
02:23:08.399 that was the future of cities right to
02:23:10.760 create mixed used townships so when he
02:23:12.680 had large Parcels of land like Brigade
02:23:14.960 Gateway which was close to 40 acres on
02:23:17.240 CBD limits um he wanted to rec create
02:23:20.720 like a city within a city so it had the
02:23:24.640 the office the residential the retail
02:23:26.920 the hospitality a school a hospital Lake
02:23:30.359 and a you know social amenities amazing
02:23:33.279 and uh I think this concept of live work
02:23:36.600 play within our cities is probably the
02:23:39.040 future because like you were talking
02:23:40.399 about the infrastructure there's so much
02:23:42.160 of pressure on our infrastructure like
02:23:45.040 every 2 years Bangalore adds about
02:23:47.000 800,000 people like which is the size of
02:23:49.359 like a Seattle or something so there's
02:23:51.520 no way our infrastructure can sort of
02:23:53.399 keep up with the demands of the people
02:23:56.160 and the population so I think the future
02:23:58.960 is doing mixed Ed townships you know
02:24:01.880 like little Fountain Head little
02:24:03.720 idealistic townships now that we have
02:24:05.720 some more moving Parts if I were to
02:24:07.439 start a real estate business and I had a
02:24:10.000 option between a JD apartment with a
02:24:12.080 land owner start a multiplex a hotel or
02:24:16.080 a commercial real estate project what
02:24:17.760 would I do I would still say please
02:24:20.399 start with some residential for a start

02:26:19.640 really cool leverage buyout Apollo was
02:26:22.080 buying out hara's entertainment which
02:26:23.840 was like a huge Casino group and loved
02:26:27.760 the whole Space while I was working on
02:26:29.520 that deal so I said okay let me explore
02:26:31.600 Hospitality a little more I took some
02:26:33.880 evening classes at uh nyu's uh
02:26:36.520 continuing School of Education and
02:26:38.399 Hospitality loved
02:26:40.319 it decided to apply to Cornell for my
02:26:42.920 masters in
02:26:44.200 Hospitality uh did that and at that time
02:26:46.800 when I graduated it was 2009 I also did
02:26:49.120 a study abroad in in Singapore because I
02:26:51.439 think Asian hospitality is something uh
02:26:54.040 very different from Western
02:26:56.120 Hospitality so um 2009 I think there was
02:26:59.359 a financial crisis happening I think
02:27:01.200 Hospitality everywhere was doing not
02:27:04.120 well except maybe India China and Africa
02:27:07.960 and at 2009 was the year that we were
02:27:10.000 also setting up our first hotel and it
02:27:11.960 was very coincidental my dad didn't say
02:27:13.720 go to hospitality or it just so
02:27:16.279 organically happened uh because I think
02:27:18.560 as a family we always dis discuss
02:27:20.439 buildings you go to a hotel you discuss
02:27:22.000 the building you go to a um on our
02:27:24.399 travels Etc so I just used to think
02:27:27.000 about hotels all the time so I came back
02:27:29.800 in 2009 to set up the hospitality
02:27:32.399 practice and I did that for a few years
02:27:36.240 um just took one portion of the business
02:27:39.880 first it was marketing then it was legal
02:27:42.479 and contracts then it was data analytics
02:27:45.040 so organically just grew my skill set in
02:27:47.040 Hospitality for about 5 six years then
02:27:50.240 and had my first child so took maternity
02:27:53.040 leave for 6 months or so or maybe 4
02:27:55.520 months and during that time I was like
02:27:57.840 okay how do I reinvent myself because I
02:27:59.640 delegated all my
02:28:01.120 responsibilities and then I came up with
02:28:03.080 this concept that time you know
02:28:04.200 housing.com was at some $300 million
02:28:08.760 valuation I think a lot of e-commerce uh
02:28:11.560 companies were doing were having these
02:28:13.160 crazy valuations and brick and motor
02:28:15.200 businesses like ours were with tangible
02:28:18.000 assets and profit making had lower value
02:28:20.120 valuations so I realized at that point
02:28:22.200 of time you know we need a play in Tech
02:28:24.200 because Tech is going to help you grow
02:28:26.279 exponentially um so that's when I set up
02:28:28.279 Brigade reap it was Asia's first real
02:28:31.160 estate accelerator program
02:28:33.960 2016 so 20 I joined the business in 2009
02:28:36.920 so 2016 I uh decided to and and at that
02:28:40.399 time I I actually wanted to start my own
02:28:42.120 co-working brand because I was like how
02:28:43.680 do I reinvent myself and I thought I'll
02:28:46.080 do this one startup of co-working or
02:28:47.960 using spaces more efficiently you know
02:28:50.160 just finding little nooks and Corners
02:28:52.240 that are not used efficiently and then
02:28:54.040 create a business out of it and then you
02:28:56.520 realize you know the startup world is a
02:28:58.760 very difficult world so I said why work
02:29:02.120 with one startup when I can work with
02:29:03.840 100 so the concept of reap was invest or
02:29:07.600 Mentor have equity in 100 Tech startups
02:29:10.600 that the real estate industry can use so
02:29:13.160 fast forward uh 7 years we're about at
02:29:15.880 70 75 companies so we should get to a
02:29:18.840 100 number in a couple of years and then
02:29:23.000 one of our CEOs in the office and Retail
02:29:25.279 vertical left he was handling both
02:29:26.880 verticals and at that point in time my
02:29:28.560 dad said you know why don't you look
02:29:30.359 after the office and Retail vertical so
02:29:32.479 those were two industries which I didn't
02:29:34.439 know anything about and like I said I
02:29:36.160 had to learn to understand and love them
02:29:39.279 and I I genuinely enjoy the businesses
02:29:41.680 now so it did that expanded to office
02:29:44.240 and Retail and then uh set up a
02:29:47.279 co-working brand as well at in 2019 what
02:29:50.120 is it called it's called Buzz works
02:29:51.520 because all co-working brands must have
02:29:53.279 works or Co in it so it was called Buzz
02:29:56.520 Works uh and um only in India they add
02:30:00.040 the S everywhere even for we work
02:30:03.120 everyone here is call it we works we
02:30:05.680 work we works is the most annoying thing
02:30:08.040 but but my brand has the S incorporated
02:30:10.560 into it so it doesn't get butchered um
02:30:13.600 yeah and then been doing that just been
02:30:15.120 growing those portfolios recently set up
02:30:17.319 a fund cat to air fund again to focus
02:30:21.160 more on Prop Tech and uh in the middle I
02:30:23.960 think along the way like you started
02:30:25.640 your restaurant business I think when I
02:30:27.240 came into the hospitality space I had
02:30:29.720 not worked I had done a few internships
02:30:31.920 in Four Season Singapore Leela Palace
02:30:34.439 Bangalore Ritz Caron DC but I had not
02:30:36.880 like gotten my hands dirty for a while
02:30:38.800 so I said I'll set up a couple of
02:30:40.120 restaurants so I set up high Ultra
02:30:41.920 Lounge in malleswaram I've been there
02:30:44.640 yeah and that was one of those things
02:30:46.920 where everybody I went to all the
02:30:48.560 restaurants in the city the top 10 guys
02:30:51.279 and they all said no it's too much of a
02:30:52.760 risk it's too big it's too far it's too
02:30:54.760 this it's too that so I said okay I'm
02:30:56.600 going to do it and make sure it works
02:30:58.040 I'm going to make sure it's profitable
02:30:59.560 so I ran it for a couple of years and
02:31:01.439 then hand it over the management to the
02:31:03.680 sheritan one of our hotels so yeah so
02:31:06.520 that's how I've grown my uh portfolio so
02:31:10.279 office retail Hospitality now might look
02:31:12.920 into a bit of facility management as
02:31:14.520 well because it's very synergistic with
02:31:16.359 what we do in office and Retail so so
02:31:18.760 what is bread and butter today and what
02:31:20.319 is Jam in in the company for
02:31:24.479 you they're all bread and butter jam is
02:31:27.520 probably facility management but all
02:31:29.680 three verticals are if I look at the
02:31:31.920 overall portfolio like 60% of our Top
02:31:35.040 Line comes from residential and about 40
02:31:37.240 35 to 40% depending on where we are on
02:31:39.319 the cycle comes from the annuity income
02:31:42.080 portfolio as we like to call it so 20%
02:31:45.240 of that is office another 15% is um
02:31:49.279 hospitality
02:31:50.399 and Retail we just sort of we have only
02:31:52.200 three malls so about 5% comes from that
02:31:54.880 and facility management is also growing
02:31:56.560 I think that's also another 5% we can
02:31:58.600 add to our Top Line good transition
02:32:01.319 co-working into current yes you want me
02:32:04.399 to start from the from the start from
02:32:06.040 the beginning um born and brought throws
02:32:08.279 throws the biggest Diwali parties in
02:32:10.640 Bang by a
02:32:13.120 mile 2,000 people at least at least
02:32:17.319 invited I don't know we finally show up
02:32:20.040 but yeah it's grown it's actually become
02:32:22.720 a tradition over time I think in the
02:32:24.920 city so where did you grow up I've born
02:32:28.359 and brought up and bred in Bangalore so
02:32:30.760 I've lived here you know pretty much my
02:32:32.399 whole life
02:32:33.720 studied um studied here across two
02:32:36.600 schools with their Shel PTI um grew up
02:32:41.600 riding all the spoiled brats of right I
02:32:45.160 only went there later same I went yeah
02:32:48.560 went to a typical convent school and I
02:32:50.600 love that Convent education U but yeah I
02:32:53.800 went to ad to 11th and 12th so studied
02:32:57.600 here actually a lot of our childhood at
02:33:00.399 least me and my brother you know we
02:33:02.160 spent riding so outdoors and like around
02:33:05.560 horses and all of that stuff as we as we
02:33:09.000 kind of grew up we had this the embassy
02:33:10.920 riding school you know which was like a
02:33:13.240 huge bit of like a stud farm that my dad
02:33:15.399 had bought you know in the the 96 or
02:33:18.600 something for whatever whatever reason
02:33:20.800 which is now super crazy and he lives
02:33:23.520 for people who don't know right now you
02:33:25.359 know what they're picturing mtila Agnes
02:33:28.200 Karen Aditya stud Farm Palace Diwali
02:33:31.960 party 2000 people I think you need to
02:33:33.720 like rope some
02:33:35.520 context and it's probably putting me in
02:33:37.600 a terrible light
02:33:41.040 um yes
02:33:43.600 so that lot lot of time Outdoors lot of
02:33:47.760 time um in in like Army situations and
02:33:53.279 like you know being being in in that
02:33:55.479 Circle because that was really the the
02:33:58.840 people you would compete with you know
02:34:00.920 really in in like equestrian writing at
02:34:04.439 that time um a lot of my childhood a lot
02:34:08.720 of my teenage years I think was I I
02:34:11.880 always felt entrepreneurial like wanted
02:34:14.319 to find ways to do something whether
02:34:16.920 it's like small bits of making money in
02:34:18.920 the building
02:34:20.560 uh you know I think one of the things
02:34:22.359 that our our parents were very
02:34:23.920 particular about is like every pocket
02:34:25.560 money you have to like sort of earn and
02:34:28.120 and do something around it um in my
02:34:31.160 teenage years it's probably you know
02:34:34.040 like we spent a lot of time um I I at
02:34:38.160 least in 10th Grade like throwing these
02:34:39.760 parties for our school you know for our
02:34:41.960 class and things like that um and I
02:34:44.600 still remember you know we like the
02:34:47.439 first thrill of like making money was
02:34:50.359 was throwing our 10th grade graduation
02:34:52.920 party and I made I don't know like
02:34:55.080 40,000 rupees that night which was huge
02:34:58.399 when the next day BW I'm disappointed at
02:35:00.479 Aditi you made so no he wasn't in ADI
02:35:03.080 you said 10th grade you in VI no I was
02:35:04.840 still in Aditi but it was like 600 bucks
02:35:07.160 to get in and you you know like whatever
02:35:09.640 40,000 was profit or Revenue profit
02:35:13.240 profit yeah um and uh then went to the
02:35:18.240 UK to study at the University of Kent
02:35:20.960 just studied business
02:35:23.520 administration um and I think during my
02:35:25.840 last year of college itself I was I was
02:35:28.000 kind of done
02:35:29.359 with education and like you know going
02:35:31.920 to school I just was ready to kind of
02:35:34.319 work and do something so actually in my
02:35:36.880 last year of universities when I started
02:35:39.080 setting up our Hospitality business
02:35:41.800 which uh I run with a partner of mine so
02:35:44.800 we have you know a few restaurants in UB
02:35:46.800 City we have a catering business um
02:35:49.800 who's your partners manani yeah sidat
02:35:51.960 manani and um and now it's it's you know
02:35:55.800 it's small it's been like 10 years since
02:35:57.720 we've been since since we started it and
02:35:59.720 it just continues to operate so um so
02:36:03.000 did that for like 2 and a half years
02:36:04.920 then I fulltime
02:36:06.840 full-time uh and then I decided that I
02:36:09.720 want to come and like join the family
02:36:11.840 business I wanted to learn what was
02:36:13.479 happening the business also was growing
02:36:16.120 you know quite fast at that point in
02:36:17.880 time and uh so I actually spent 2 years
02:36:21.560 post
02:36:22.520 that what we call at least between the
02:36:25.640 three of us the shadow working so I had
02:36:29.160 a notebook I used to just sit in every
02:36:31.319 single meeting that my dad was in travel
02:36:34.560 take notes at the end of the day ask him
02:36:37.800 you know questions why did you do this
02:36:39.640 why did you say this why are we doing
02:36:41.399 this when you told me that this is X Y
02:36:44.080 and Z and there I got a huge amount of
02:36:47.760 exposure you know from buying land
02:36:50.399 dealing with villagers and like going
02:36:52.560 through that experience to dealing with
02:36:54.080 someone like Jonathan gray Blackstone
02:36:57.000 you know private equity and so
02:36:59.399 completely wide spectrum of rooms that
02:37:02.240 you know I got to be in and during that
02:37:05.720 stint I think um and my experience in
02:37:08.960 setting up the hospitality business I I
02:37:11.120 saw that we were building these huge
02:37:12.960 parks for multinational companies and
02:37:16.560 you know these large Enterprises and
02:37:18.240 they were also spending so much in the
02:37:20.399 fit outs and how the office experience
02:37:22.840 was that no one was contributing or no
02:37:26.760 one was building anything for the small
02:37:28.359 and you know small startups and you know
02:37:30.399 small businesses and this was also when
02:37:32.600 Bangalore startup scene was about to
02:37:34.600 explode or was exploding I mean Flipkart
02:37:36.800 had just raised the 16 billion round it
02:37:40.200 was you know what year was this 2014
02:37:43.120 2015 yeah around then and um and so the
02:37:48.640 idea of
02:37:50.479 having small space in our larger parks
02:37:53.720 for smaller businesses my original
02:37:56.120 thought process was like equity for
02:37:58.000 space that was you know the original
02:38:00.560 idea like a version of an incubator and
02:38:03.640 uh and then as we as I was researching
02:38:07.240 and I was you know making this huge
02:38:08.680 pitch like a management pitch to the
02:38:10.640 presentation about a new bus this new
02:38:12.600 business that we should look at we work
02:38:15.200 came up a lot when I was you know doing
02:38:17.479 a lot of the research I mean it was
02:38:19.560 still in the US they hadn't expanded
02:38:22.240 globally yet um but the concept the way
02:38:26.960 that that wew work had stacked
02:38:29.560 everything together which was you know
02:38:31.240 design technology and and like this
02:38:33.840 community layer and this infrastructure
02:38:35.920 the network for startups um was you know
02:38:39.600 something that was like exactly like as
02:38:42.560 as I was sort of like invis invis it and
02:38:46.800 coincidentally this around the same time
02:38:49.600 few early investors of wework actually
02:38:52.000 came to uh India and they started
02:38:55.479 scouting for partners because weor was
02:38:57.800 looking to expand globally um and these
02:39:02.120 guys had worked in India before so they
02:39:03.880 felt like we work and you know and India
02:39:06.439 would really do well uh over here and
02:39:10.319 that's how I uh we ended up going to New
02:39:13.319 York for like a completely separate trip
02:39:15.399 for to meet with Blackstone and we
02:39:17.920 entered a weor and you know that was
02:39:20.600 like a lifechanging light bulb moment
02:39:24.080 that was we peak in the US no this was
02:39:26.800 it was I mean post turmoil no no much
02:39:30.000 much before this
02:39:32.240 was again they had only a few offices in
02:39:34.960 New York and one office in London one
02:39:37.120 office in
02:39:38.120 Amsterdam um they were still valued at
02:39:40.800 like 10 billion uh which was crazy but
02:39:44.680 it was only post that post us you know
02:39:47.399 having that meeting when it really got
02:39:49.760 absolutely crazy so we went there we met
02:39:53.160 Adam we spent about a year and a half
02:39:56.479 almost trying to figure out partnership
02:39:58.880 because earlier we workor was actually
02:40:00.520 trying to have multiple partners in
02:40:02.840 India they were looking at dlf they were
02:40:05.359 looking at you know Reas they were
02:40:07.680 looking at us RMZ so they were they were
02:40:10.640 really like exploring and we kind of
02:40:13.680 said that look if you want multiple
02:40:15.160 partners I don't think we the people
02:40:16.680 because this won't work in India with m
02:40:19.319 multiple developers as partners so we
02:40:21.520 started working on our own brand and um
02:40:25.840 and that it sort of evolved you know
02:40:28.600 they didn't get along with dlf or they
02:40:30.920 didn't get along with uh you know Ras or
02:40:34.600 they were much more conservative in the
02:40:36.319 thought process and Adam was you know
02:40:38.319 obviously at at in this crazy on this
02:40:41.120 crazy Mission um so we went back to them
02:40:44.319 but the deal was still not happening uh
02:40:46.920 we weren't able to agree on terms Adam
02:40:49.640 was already valuing the business at like
02:40:51.399 2 billion before putting a brick or or
02:40:54.840 like a billion in uh a building in and
02:40:58.520 um and so we weren't actually you know
02:41:00.880 getting there and then finally we
02:41:03.040 realized that his priority or we Works
02:41:05.319 priority was more China and more Europe
02:41:07.920 than it was India that's how we kind of
02:41:10.880 proposed that look we'll take the brand
02:41:13.680 you know give us the ability to use the
02:41:15.520 brand and we'll invest our Capital how
02:41:18.359 big is the work now
02:41:20.600 globally India your we India we operate
02:41:24.120 almost like 8 million square foot we
02:41:26.240 just open our 60th location last week
02:41:29.640 and how many people is that it's about a
02:41:32.760 capacity of about 95,000 deaths we have
02:41:35.800 close to about 72,000 members now um and
02:41:39.640 occupancy on average occupancy right now
02:41:42.600 is probably around like between 75 to 80
02:41:46.120 uh but we've added also a lot of
02:41:47.920 capacity in the last last in the last
02:41:50.160 few months and is this part of Embassy
02:41:53.600 the is Embassy the holding company yeah
02:41:56.640 so Embassy is still the largest
02:42:00.399 shareholder we we started off owning
02:42:03.240 100% of it and um and we've also
02:42:06.439 invested like you know pretty much all
02:42:08.200 of our own Capital until 2020 where we
02:42:11.120 were put in some money uh you know they
02:42:13.920 put in about $100 million so they own
02:42:16.800 about 27% of the business is there a
02:42:19.840 standardized number that you spend on
02:42:21.600 square feet after leasing a
02:42:23.520 property yeah so we spend and we're in
02:42:28.120 the mid to premium segment of the market
02:42:30.920 so we spend close to you are the most
02:42:32.800 premium I think there are more premium
02:42:35.160 players I mean like like yeah smaller
02:42:37.640 the executive centers an example is
02:42:39.560 maybe but you're on average 15,000 rupes
02:42:41.800 a seat we are closer to 20 no but your
02:42:45.279 spend per CAPIC but I remember when they
02:42:47.279 came in everybody's like oh my God they
02:42:48.760 spend x amount per we got it much much
02:42:52.080 more much more efficient we spent close
02:42:53.880 to about 2,500 bucks a square 2,800
02:42:58.120 bucks depending on the location
02:42:59.800 initially when you came it was all 4,000
02:43:02.160 5,000 yeah but you know there I think
02:43:04.960 the first two locations we were trying
02:43:06.680 to replicate what was happen what was
02:43:09.160 being built in other parts of the world
02:43:11.279 and then we localized a supply chain we
02:43:14.200 understood how to localize the product
02:43:16.520 but in terms of quality of the space I
02:43:18.680 would say that we've were as good or if
02:43:21.760 not better than any other you know
02:43:23.960 location in the world so the Delta
02:43:26.560 Arbitrage of the experience that you get
02:43:28.560 here versus what you get outside maybe
02:43:30.920 of a wework is just so massive um which
02:43:34.279 is what I think is driving one a lot of
02:43:36.279 the stickiness and also the demand for
02:43:39.240 you know our spaces when you when you
02:43:41.399 look at it in terms of from a
02:43:44.200 multinational you know Spen standpoint
02:43:46.680 India is still pretty much like $1
02:43:49.680 rentals they've been $1 rentals for the
02:43:52.319 last you know 20 years so the cost
02:43:54.920 Arbitrage and being able to get a space
02:43:57.520 like ours they're willing to pay you
02:44:00.479 know a premium uh because hey this is
02:44:03.840 this is something I can do right as a
02:44:05.279 20-year-old starting off you can there's
02:44:08.200 like every mom and pop Guy opening a
02:44:10.319 coworking space What are the financials
02:44:12.600 if it see I've managed to raise or
02:44:14.439 borrow 10 CR rupees yeah I rent a
02:44:16.960 building on Church Street which is
02:44:20.040 10,000 square ft I spend what did you
02:44:23.600 say 3,000 per square feet yeah so I
02:44:25.640 spend three cres on the Interiors yeah
02:44:28.279 and then I can fit in a chair for every
02:44:31.439 150 square ft no it'll be less so I
02:44:35.319 think the the like a big way we bring
02:44:39.279 value or we add value is actually
02:44:41.600 through the design of the spaces where
02:44:43.800 we're able to have density and make you
02:44:48.040 feel like you have you know all of the
02:44:50.640 space so you're basically paying for
02:44:52.600 let's say a twers office but you get
02:44:55.160 access to like a six-story building
02:44:57.840 right which has meeting room so it's
02:45:00.000 very much a shared economy is concept
02:45:03.359 where density plays a huge part so we
02:45:06.359 are able to almost bring it down to
02:45:08.200 let's say 65 you know square foot per
02:45:11.240 person and you have the hot seat thing
02:45:13.120 so I don't have a definitive seat but I
02:45:15.040 can that's a very very small percentage
02:45:17.240 it's only about 3% of ourti
02:45:19.680 but why is that that seems to make on
02:45:21.960 paper this business model makes so much
02:45:23.920 sense right M it's so variable right I
02:45:26.240 feel like it's like a hotel it's like
02:45:27.880 the hotel business where if you give
02:45:29.479 your hot desking rates if you don't have
02:45:31.680 somebody the next day you if you don't
02:45:33.920 rent it you lose it and also but now I
02:45:37.680 feel like the market is moving more
02:45:39.359 towards managed offices which is a more
02:45:41.479 stable you know lockin of 3 years you
02:45:44.560 know lockin of four years 5 years so
02:45:46.680 that you you know where your income is
02:45:48.600 coming so I would say that's
02:45:50.640 why uh India and and maybe like Indian
02:45:54.240 Flex players are doing well and we
02:45:57.120 actually do everything we go from a day
02:45:59.120 pass you know to to like a classic
02:46:02.840 co-working ready to move in type of
02:46:04.720 space which can go up to even thousand
02:46:06.760 desks or a full building to a managed
02:46:10.040 office product which is fully bespoke
02:46:12.760 design Source design build and operate
02:46:14.840 for you like I will do the entire thing
02:46:17.240 from showing you multiple buildings to
02:46:19.160 designing the office to managing it to
02:46:21.640 fitting it out all for one you know
02:46:24.279 amortized sort of like check um but
02:46:27.399 should I do it if I'm a 20-y old and I
02:46:29.160 can rent 10,000 square fet I think that
02:46:31.600 you need to have a ability for the to
02:46:33.880 Source the funnel also like none of it
02:46:36.359 works if you're not able to actually
02:46:38.200 fill it up fill it up right and uh that
02:46:40.920 comes that has many many many you know
02:46:44.200 factors that come with it and to her
02:46:46.479 point at least what we do is we do
02:46:49.160 shorter term contracts as well as
02:46:51.640 long-term contracts so I like to
02:46:53.479 describe our business basically as like
02:46:55.279 office leasing at hypers speed which is
02:46:58.560 everything's happening faster renewals
02:47:00.359 are coming up faster growth is happening
02:47:02.200 faster deals are also happening faster
02:47:04.720 revenu is also kicking in Faster like
02:47:07.120 it's a it's a completely F you know in
02:47:10.920 in really in like in hypers speed so
02:47:12.720 unless you have that muscle built which
02:47:15.200 has taken us you know a while and we
02:47:17.040 also replicated a lot of what we got
02:47:19.160 from wework I think it's a very tough
02:47:21.240 business which is why feel like most
02:47:23.439 landlords also haven't successfully been
02:47:26.520 able to do it all over the world cuz it
02:47:29.640 it is it is a completely different
02:47:32.760 expertise and it is a big reason why we
02:47:35.640 built it almost separately from Embassy
02:47:38.279 was you know this ability to have uh to
02:47:41.359 take space from other developers to
02:47:43.279 really build it from a DNA and culture
02:47:45.560 perspective also F fully focused around
02:47:49.840 the you know the co-working side of the
02:47:52.040 business so if I may add to that so I
02:47:53.960 feel like if you have 10 crores you can
02:47:56.080 do a co-working space and if you had 100
02:47:58.359 cres then you would build a full office
02:47:59.840 building and similarly like for the
02:48:01.720 restaurant if you had 10 Crowes very
02:48:03.479 easy for you to do a two two to three
02:48:06.120 restaurants but if you had like 100 cres
02:48:08.439 you could build a hotel so I what would
02:48:09.960 be my return my Roi on I think in both I
02:48:13.160 mean in co-working I think 20% returns
02:48:15.880 is 20 to 25% is possible put in 10 cres
02:48:19.479 I can make two yes and in office also
02:48:23.160 same
02:48:24.840 similar they say 7 8% rental yield right
02:48:28.319 78% rental yield but so co-working like
02:48:32.439 the office part is just the rental stack
02:48:35.560 and your top line and your profit will
02:48:37.359 be you know really on the rental stack
02:48:40.439 and you have obviously there huge cost
02:48:42.080 of the capex part of it we just take
02:48:44.800 leases you know our cost of buildout is
02:48:47.640 is X but we have
02:48:49.560 rental Opex the capex amortization and
02:48:53.600 you know like our slight margin on it so
02:48:56.520 on the square footage the realization
02:48:58.640 can be almost like three times what it
02:49:01.319 is of just the plain vanilla rental
02:49:04.319 right because you're stacking everything
02:49:05.680 under one in office you while you get
02:49:08.600 the annual yield of whatever 8% or 9%
02:49:11.200 between 7 to 9% you actually make your
02:49:14.040 money when you sell it also or you put a
02:49:17.200 capital value to it so then you have a
02:49:19.359 cap rate of say 8% and then you'll
02:49:21.359 you'll make High Teens to High Teens I
02:49:24.239 would say before you could make even
02:49:25.560 early 20s right I think with the way
02:49:27.520 land price is going up now it's like
02:49:29.520 High Teens plus there's leverage on it
02:49:31.319 right yeah you can get lease rent
02:49:33.120 discounting and then you have a lot of
02:49:34.520 fible money to play with I'm going to
02:49:36.880 ask you both a bunch of like questions
02:49:39.880 around real estate that I have either of
02:49:42.760 you can pick or both of you can answer
02:49:45.040 them how important a role does
02:49:50.080 do relationships play in the real estate
02:49:53.080 business having dinner with the land
02:49:55.239 owner a lot yeah should we do a rating
02:49:57.960 like N9 on 10 n and a half yeah 1 to 10
02:50:01.319 how much 10 yeah n and a half is that
02:50:03.920 the most important thing which
02:50:05.160 differentiates a successful and
02:50:08.239 unsuccessful no I wouldn't say it's the
02:50:10.800 most important thing but it is I think
02:50:13.160 relationships in any business or most
02:50:15.520 businesses maybe not in your stock stock
02:50:17.680 broking business
02:50:19.319 but I think it is a huge aspect to it
02:50:21.720 because you get more deals by say you
02:50:24.479 have a good relationship with the land
02:50:25.840 owner he'll talk to other people and
02:50:28.000 then it's very small community of people
02:50:30.399 I think that you're like you know really
02:50:32.120 kind of stuck with that partnership for
02:50:34.080 a very extended period of time it's not
02:50:37.520 a short partnership it's not something
02:50:39.520 that ends in you know a year or two like
02:50:42.120 almost each development is its own
02:50:44.359 business it can you know H live for
02:50:47.720 however long
02:50:49.160 uh if it's office is that's the annity
02:50:51.239 income that's you know coming over
02:50:52.800 decades if it's resi there's you know
02:50:55.960 that at least the cycle to like build so
02:50:59.640 and I think most businessmen work on
02:51:02.720 relationship I think most most business
02:51:04.800 but here it's very specific like I'm
02:51:06.560 thinking if I were a land owner yeah and
02:51:09.640 nupa and Karan came to me how would I
02:51:12.200 decide who to do a JV with cuz it's not
02:51:15.160 about returns alone right so I don't
02:51:17.800 think you would suppose I don't know
02:51:19.720 your closer I don't think you would just
02:51:21.840 give it to whoever is your closer friend
02:51:24.239 I think you would just weigh on so many
02:51:26.279 other things like on the financial
02:51:29.160 conservativeness of the company or the
02:51:31.560 um ability or reputation of the company
02:51:34.279 has he done XYZ projects if you want to
02:51:36.640 do office has he done office before
02:51:39.040 what's the expertise what's the funding
02:51:41.960 for it there's so many other aspects but
02:51:43.920 obviously in any any business
02:51:45.560 relationships are super important it's
02:51:47.600 how you get your reference
02:51:49.160 it's your reputation so many other
02:51:50.760 things but I would not say that suppose
02:51:53.600 I don't do even if I'm not friends with
02:51:55.880 you you still might choose me because
02:51:58.040 maybe products could be better or
02:52:00.080 certain strengths could be better and I
02:52:03.040 wouldn't always say it's a wi and type
02:52:05.000 of relationship with politicians yeah
02:52:08.680 how important is nine nine I would say
02:52:12.520 nine at if you're at operating at scale
02:52:17.040 I would say it's nine I I don't
02:52:18.920 necessarily think it's as important I
02:52:20.680 think it's maybe six or seven I don't
02:52:24.200 think you need to know a politician to
02:52:26.800 do well because I feel like getting
02:52:30.040 approvals and stuff is fairly
02:52:31.560 transactional there's a method to the
02:52:33.479 madness do you think real estate will go
02:52:36.040 the way that many Industries in India
02:52:38.960 have where we have monopolies and
02:52:41.040 duopolies the big will keep getting
02:52:43.279 bigger until there are two or three left
02:52:46.040 I I don't no so I don't think it's it
02:52:50.120 can be like monop monopolistic or
02:52:52.479 duopolistic just because of how the
02:52:54.359 scale of where things are but there has
02:52:56.760 been a huge consolidation in the market
02:52:58.800 especially postco we saw almost 60% of
02:53:01.239 smaller guys like shut shop um and now
02:53:05.080 slowly they're coming up again but there
02:53:07.520 was a huge move towards the larger
02:53:10.439 players so the larger players got a
02:53:12.239 larger market share and that's why you
02:53:14.000 see valuations going crazy postco
02:53:16.160 branded and Trust right like that we
02:53:18.640 talking about that is a driving Factor
02:53:20.880 but not to say that Regional you know
02:53:23.279 local developers will not grow and and
02:53:26.560 kind of become big in their own City or
02:53:29.960 uh it'll be tough to maybe make another
02:53:31.800 dlf Prestige Embassy Brigade that is lot
02:53:35.600 of like Decades of work but you could
02:53:38.000 get like your Reliance your Adis your
02:53:41.600 beras your you know those houses can
02:53:44.120 enter India is maybe one of the places
02:53:46.319 also where the rental jumps are quite
02:53:49.720 fast and quite High which is unlike
02:53:52.040 other markets starting still from a
02:53:54.640 relatively low base when they see it and
02:53:57.080 this cost Arbitrage and so much
02:53:58.920 offshoring and the amount of like demand
02:54:01.960 that exists if you're able and and also
02:54:04.399 I think developers here when they
02:54:06.399 started liquidity was you know super
02:54:09.520 hard to get by you would get only really
02:54:12.160 expensive uh super expensive capital or
02:54:14.840 you wouldn't get funding from the bank
02:54:17.120 uh and things like that so so I think
02:54:20.200 Blackstone or Tuan if I'm not mistaken
02:54:22.560 for 5 years didn't even put a check in
02:54:24.720 they just they just observed the
02:54:28.399 landscape and then finally solely you
02:54:30.800 know forged these Partnerships so
02:54:33.359 India's been very very successful for
02:54:35.160 them I think it's been their most
02:54:36.640 profitable Market outside of the of the
02:54:39.840 US but also they've come into fairly
02:54:41.960 nent spaces right like they came into
02:54:44.680 retail created the first retail reate
02:54:47.319 came into office cre the first office
02:54:49.279 Street and they've monetized now of
02:54:50.960 course getting into industrial they've
02:54:52.840 been able to monetize in spaces which
02:54:55.359 were not monetizable
02:54:57.920 before I have this friend his name is
02:55:00.720 Marcel Areno I don't know if you guys
02:55:02.760 have heard of him he's like this
02:55:04.920 prolific real estate investor who is 70
02:55:09.880 plus he's on my Gates pledge thing he's
02:55:12.760 a philanthropist as well I was in the US
02:55:15.560 recently and he sat me down one day we
02:55:17.960 were having dinner uh we were in ohigh
02:55:21.920 which is like 100 kilometers from
02:55:24.680 California let's say and he made this
02:55:27.720 case for why he is shorting commercial
02:55:31.040 real estate across the world uh he was
02:55:35.080 not shorting India per se because he
02:55:37.960 hadn't done enough research but
02:55:39.439 definitely parts of America parts of
02:55:42.439 China and he said culture has changed in
02:55:47.239 a manner that
02:55:50.000 uh people pricing properties have not
02:55:52.800 taken cognizance of what do you guys
02:55:55.160 think of that changes like work from
02:55:58.680 home people don't want to spend one two
02:56:01.239 hours in traffic every
02:56:03.000 day uh interest rates in the US for
02:56:06.120 mortgages went from 23% to
02:56:10.720 67% uh lots of delinquencies in
02:56:15.120 commercial properties in the US we had
02:56:17.800 this full
02:56:19.080 pre aai we had this bust in the Valley
02:56:22.640 real estate commercial real estate you
02:56:25.040 see signs of that in different parts of
02:56:27.080 America today he had a bunch of reasons
02:56:29.279 he had like a proper 2hour presentation
02:56:31.239 that he made and he he is somebody who's
02:56:34.600 always been right think in his 50 60
02:56:38.960 year investment Journey he's been bang
02:56:41.600 on he was right uh pre the subprime
02:56:45.239 crisis are you talking like real estate
02:56:47.840 as a whole or commercial or what real
02:56:50.000 estate as a whole he has been right but
02:56:51.800 he was shorting commercial real estate
02:56:54.239 in
02:56:55.439 particular I think there are certain
02:56:57.840 markets which have matured so much and
02:57:02.439 it's maybe unclear in this moment of
02:57:05.479 time what's going to happen to those
02:57:08.279 locations but I believe that if you know
02:57:11.279 you take like some City like New York or
02:57:13.239 San Francisco or London and you look at
02:57:16.000 you know those towers and and that type
02:57:17.960 of real estate M I don't think those
02:57:20.399 will
02:57:21.279 ever you know really go out of value
02:57:24.439 that that you know that will not become
02:57:27.000 places that continue to see people and
02:57:29.680 demand because the there's only one
02:57:31.720 London there's only one New York but
02:57:33.399 there was only one San Francisco in so
02:57:35.439 much there fell 50% right
02:57:38.920 but I don't know like over a long period
02:57:41.760 of time if that's necessarily going to
02:57:44.399 you know continue to be through I think
02:57:46.040 there's like a hangover of you know of
02:57:48.239 Co and and all of this stuff but India
02:57:51.720 is like a very very
02:57:53.680 different part of that growth or at
02:57:56.160 least like place in that growth right
02:57:57.640 we're still not saturated supplies so
02:58:00.080 low comparatively to the population
02:58:02.880 people have come back to work uh and
02:58:05.840 come back to the office and uh that
02:58:08.880 transition still yet to happen but I
02:58:12.000 think most private Equity guys including
02:58:14.920 Blackstone and things like that if you
02:58:16.319 see have allocated out of commercial to
02:58:20.399 other asset classes within real estate
02:58:22.479 data centers warehousing residential as
02:58:25.920 a cycle so it's probably a cyclical
02:58:28.800 thing is my feeling so my view is that
02:58:31.319 you know in the US of course there is
02:58:34.080 about 1 billion square fet of grade
02:58:36.279 office space that is lying empty so um I
02:58:39.520 can see why he
02:58:41.080 would think that way but I just feel
02:58:44.200 that we've gone through this whole thing
02:58:46.520 of okay what is the future of office
02:58:48.359 space and I mean the number of panels
02:58:49.960 we've done on offic is dead it's work
02:58:52.399 from home going forward um is just a lot
02:58:57.080 but what we've seen now is of course the
02:58:58.720 whole return to office and everybody has
02:59:01.560 has gone through the whole work from
02:59:03.040 home they coming back to return to
02:59:05.200 office and we've been in touch with all
02:59:06.960 the um large e-commerce guys mnc's from
02:59:10.479 the US Etc and everybody seeing value in
02:59:12.960 being back in the office and India is
02:59:15.200 going to have its probably most
02:59:17.000 successful year of office leing I think
02:59:19.239 just in the first half of this year some
02:59:21.399 34 million s ft of office space has been
02:59:23.640 transacted and that's half the year
02:59:25.720 second half of the years usually more
02:59:27.640 has more transactions so you'll probably
02:59:29.160 hit 70 million square ft and I still
02:59:32.880 don't know if I can say okay the office
02:59:35.160 segment will stay there in eternity to
02:59:37.439 come but I feel that it is strong at
02:59:39.880 least for the next 10 years 10 to 15
02:59:42.080 years I don't see it going out of um out
02:59:45.399 of fashion at all what happened to
02:59:48.040 prefab I remember this
02:59:51.279 whole yeah Kera fil sold his company to
02:59:54.520 them KF yes Richard used to work for KF
02:59:58.760 yeah so I thought that would be the next
03:00:00.640 big thing and I thought this is it man
03:00:02.960 like you know like going prefab is the
03:00:05.800 way to go but when we sorry I'll just
03:00:08.120 finish my point um but when we when you
03:00:11.560 look at it while you can cut your um
03:00:14.840 time the timelines by almost a third the
03:00:17.560 cost was is also like 3 to 4X higher and
03:00:20.800 also you can't knowing how Indian
03:00:22.720 construction is done and how planning is
03:00:24.960 done there's a lot of onsite changes MH
03:00:28.040 and you can't be even like half a
03:00:29.560 millimeter wrong right because if you're
03:00:31.040 even half a millimeter wrong you'll have
03:00:32.720 constant C pitches you'll have so
03:00:34.120 there's no room for error and I don't
03:00:36.120 think we've reached that level of
03:00:37.520 perfection and since labor is still
03:00:40.160 cheap you can't um people weren't
03:00:42.760 willing to pay the price for prefab and
03:00:45.840 you also need large volumes in order to
03:00:47.760 make make the machinery and the factory
03:00:49.279 work yeah I think China does prefab
03:00:52.359 quite well they're able to put up
03:00:54.840 hospitals and apartment buildings and
03:00:56.960 all within days and and then months um I
03:01:01.560 just don't know if we have the execution
03:01:04.000 capability and the the labor cost here
03:01:06.000 are still so cheap that it still just
03:01:07.680 makes sense to put people on the side
03:01:10.279 they're going up fast right labor
03:01:12.640 cost it's still under control I would
03:01:15.479 say I mean
03:01:18.319 yeah it's still under
03:01:19.880 control what about cash in the real
03:01:22.319 estate ecosystem mhm like if I go
03:01:25.560 further of tier two tier three towns it
03:01:28.279 gets progressively worse do you think
03:01:33.080 most black money in India is still
03:01:35.880 sitting in real estate I suspect it is I
03:01:39.319 feel it's drastically reduced I mean see
03:01:43.200 us being a public listed entity almost
03:01:45.479 everything is check everything is check
03:01:48.359 where is all the black money in India
03:01:49.920 sitting give me one word answer real
03:01:53.560 estate I wouldn't say it where isse
03:01:57.640 manufacturing good car L of good car
03:02:00.840 good car will be sitting in
03:02:03.840 duai I feel it's not with your large
03:02:06.640 entities right it's with the smaller
03:02:08.600 unorganized sector it's not with the
03:02:11.120 large I mean we we can't but that
03:02:14.040 smaller unorganized is the larger chunk
03:02:15.920 of Indiana yeah organized this quite
03:02:18.439 tiny Oran it's like an 8020 20% is organ
03:02:22.359 it's been reducing a lot Senior
03:02:26.000 Living what do you think of it as an
03:02:28.279 opportunity so um I think great
03:02:30.960 opportunity but one learning that we had
03:02:33.520 was that when you just have like senior
03:02:35.520 living just if you just do senior living
03:02:37.960 as the only thing in as a project I
03:02:40.439 don't think it's as successful because
03:02:42.560 old people don't want to be surrounded
03:02:44.120 by other old people right because if I'm
03:02:47.040 old and I need need help I don't want to
03:02:48.920 call another elderly person like I need
03:02:51.800 a young Fit Body so what we've realized
03:02:55.040 is when you do larger townships you have
03:02:57.160 one building or one tower for um
03:03:00.160 assisted living or senior living but
03:03:02.439 they like to be surrounded by younger
03:03:04.399 kids dogs you know middle-aged people
03:03:06.800 because that's who they can call on for
03:03:08.479 help if they ever need anything you know
03:03:11.040 so underserved right there's no one
03:03:14.479 really I mean doing anything and I guess
03:03:17.399 it's this notion that India is just a
03:03:19.160 young young young you know country but
03:03:21.439 no we're growing old fast yeah exactly
03:03:23.279 so and no one is is really catering you
03:03:25.880 can even become a real there are a
03:03:27.399 couple of people focused on it but like
03:03:29.279 I said I don't know if it's scale yeah
03:03:31.880 because what we tried doing you know
03:03:34.600 just senior living and it didn't work um
03:03:38.040 we had to sort of modify the plan to
03:03:40.399 have only one Tower is Senior Living
03:03:42.040 otherwise old people don't want to just
03:03:43.640 be surrounded by other old people we're
03:03:45.239 doing it in a in a you know like in a
03:03:48.359 Township B Township makes sense that
03:03:51.080 it's integrated a friend of mine does
03:03:53.000 this at scale adash adash yeah adash
03:03:55.160 does Primus yeah other will be happy
03:03:57.840 only yeah 20 people will Google Primus p
03:04:01.239 r i m more than
03:04:04.600 20 okay on the flip side if I am unable
03:04:09.359 to start a business in real estate and I
03:04:11.760 want a job what skill sets will you hire
03:04:14.880 for and how much salary will you pay me
03:04:19.479 okay so real estate I think I'm younger
03:04:21.319 and more hardworking and
03:04:23.200 ambitious I think there's a whole gamut
03:04:26.080 of job roles that you can take right
03:04:29.000 ranging from of course the basic is
03:04:30.720 engineering whether you're a civil
03:04:32.120 engineer structural engineer mechanical
03:04:34.640 engineer electrical engineer those are
03:04:37.040 all roles that Builders like our will
03:04:39.120 hire and then you have like any
03:04:41.319 corporate um like any corporate You'
03:04:43.640 need your marketing functions you need
03:04:46.000 sales or Leasing
03:04:48.239 HR uh PR uh lawyers you need lien guys
03:04:53.880 you need Architects interior designers
03:04:57.120 project managers so there's a whole
03:04:59.640 gamut of them I think initially real
03:05:01.960 estate used to be maybe I would say 10
03:05:04.200 15 years ago not a very sexy business um
03:05:08.319 and the kind of people we could hire
03:05:10.399 were not from the best schools but I
03:05:13.359 think that's changing now and you know
03:05:14.840 you're able to hire from your iits
03:05:16.760 you're able to hire from your IM ISB is
03:05:19.800 there some like part-time course I can
03:05:21.760 do to make me more hirable or
03:05:24.279 internship you can just work with a
03:05:26.399 builder um as an intern as an intern and
03:05:29.960 but honestly I feel if I email nupa at
03:05:32.399 Brigade and say I want to be an intern
03:05:34.319 will you consider yeah what are the odds
03:05:37.160 I'm hiring in my treasury team I don't
03:05:38.800 know
03:05:39.600 like anyone else is going but straight
03:05:43.800 into the treasury team he's talking
03:05:45.800 about unknown face andig
03:05:48.279 yeah like I'd put you it depends on what
03:05:50.560 your interests are but I've had so many
03:05:52.800 people intern some want to just Shadow
03:05:54.640 me I don't allow too much of that
03:05:56.279 because I don't like to be
03:05:58.000 shadowed I don't want my calendar to be
03:06:01.399 known and whereabouts to be known but um
03:06:04.279 in reap we'll put you in if you want to
03:06:06.160 work with tech and startups you want to
03:06:07.760 work with marketing project you want to
03:06:09.680 work with um if you're an engineer we
03:06:12.479 can give you an internship there too but
03:06:14.479 we we we started hiring from your itms
03:06:17.960 isbs IM because we want those kind of
03:06:20.920 people to start and will you pay as well
03:06:22.479 as startups and tech companies so that's
03:06:25.359 a tough one startups and uh I mean tech
03:06:27.720 companies startups anything we we sell
03:06:30.279 you the hope of EA yeah no but I mean
03:06:32.920 depends what I think now things have
03:06:35.120 sort of mellowed down a bit there was a
03:06:37.000 time when I was like their CTO would be
03:06:38.960 more than our CFOs and the CEOs but now
03:06:43.399 I think things have mellowed down is
03:06:44.960 there a different hierarchy does CFO
03:06:46.760 come above C in real estate yeah there's
03:06:49.880 no CTO in real estate right by the way
03:06:51.960 we started we've started we have yeah we
03:06:54.800 are looking at Tech as a big angle even
03:06:57.439 though like real estate and construction
03:06:59.040 spend less than 1% of their Topline on
03:07:01.479 it which includes your laptops and sap
03:07:04.279 licenses and Microsoft licenses so it's
03:07:06.800 hardly anything on Tech if you really
03:07:08.560 look at it but I think that's slowly
03:07:10.720 changing right lot of investment into
03:07:14.319 going paperless and using AI for better
03:07:17.960 marketing returns Etc any AI
03:07:20.040 implementation in real estate we have in
03:07:24.800 I mean at least at the wework level we
03:07:27.000 using a decent chunk now um we have our
03:07:30.640 own like um we use it for design so to
03:07:34.399 do like our layouts Clash detection you
03:07:38.040 know for MEP type of design um it's
03:07:42.399 we're using it for our like our inside
03:07:44.920 sales team so you know a chat B support
03:07:48.760 bot um we are using it I mean I've made
03:07:53.439 at least like a big chunk of the team at
03:07:55.399 least have chat GPT licenses when
03:07:58.439 they're you know doing research our
03:08:00.760 Innovation team uses it like a decent
03:08:03.560 chunk
03:08:04.640 but I would say yeah I would say that we
03:08:08.080 we are using it maybe more than most
03:08:10.920 people in real estate but also CU our
03:08:13.359 business is is slightly like different
03:08:16.000 right um yeah yeah but still still and
03:08:19.200 like you know whatever creative our
03:08:20.720 brand Team uses it a bit to do to do
03:08:23.760 that yeah lots of um AI for marketing
03:08:27.080 like how do you spend that marketing
03:08:28.520 dollar better um again also chat boards
03:08:32.319 to help and enhance customer experience
03:08:34.800 there are even chat Bots to do your
03:08:36.279 calls like your one800 number calls um
03:08:39.319 we're also using AI to look at Safety
03:08:41.720 and Security like using cameras to
03:08:44.920 detect any uh Potential Threat threats
03:08:47.680 and issues lot of video analytics
03:08:50.279 behavioral analytics in malls busy
03:08:52.319 spaces okay somebody behaving funny so
03:08:55.000 quite a few
03:08:56.040 uses nice yeah so the main outcome we do
03:09:00.239 this for is to get more young people
03:09:03.600 into
03:09:04.600 entrepreneurship okay we do it
03:09:06.960 obsessively and we do something that
03:09:09.479 will help that community at the end of
03:09:12.640 each show yeah uh so it's either by
03:09:18.040 giving
03:09:19.520 money to a young company which we see
03:09:23.200 promising it could be uh giving someone
03:09:26.640 time of yours to Shadow you it could be
03:09:29.319 some somebody who interns in your
03:09:30.960 treasury team yeah so we will we'll
03:09:34.040 figure out amidst ourself I'll catch
03:09:36.359 ifan Uncle also we'll make him give some
03:09:38.880 time yeah and we will go out and look
03:09:42.760 for some really smart young kids who
03:09:45.920 want to work boys and girls who want to
03:09:48.080 work in real estate we'll find them and
03:09:50.239 we'll do something we'll put this out
03:09:52.200 later we'll discuss offline but thank
03:09:55.000 you guys for doing this this has been
03:09:57.840 thank you a long time 5 hours of
03:10:01.200 speaking 6 hours wow so thank you was
03:10:05.920 it the
03:10:11.040 last they Outsource being such GI there
03:10:15.200 any services that you guys Outsource are
03:10:17.800 you asking that or should I answer what
03:10:20.239 are the things you Outsource you guys
03:10:22.600 are going to hear something for the
03:10:23.960 first time
03:10:27.040 ever being such large companies what do
03:10:30.160 you
03:10:30.960 Outsource so quite a few things yeah a
03:10:33.800 lot I feel like the role of a builder is
03:10:36.439 to be like a project manager so we're
03:10:38.279 just managing everything but we
03:10:40.680 subcontracting the laborers um while we
03:10:44.120 have Architects to oversee the whole
03:10:46.080 design development your Outsourcing the
03:10:48.200 actual uh drawings Etc to other
03:10:50.800 Architects interior designers or and
03:10:53.160 lawyers we have in-house lawyers but you
03:10:55.120 Outsource like title opinion and all the
03:10:57.520 leg work to external lawyers so
03:10:59.399 everything I feel is you have marketing
03:11:01.680 guys to monitor other marketing agencies
03:11:04.160 so I feel like our role as a uh Builder
03:11:07.399 is to like project manage all these
03:11:10.000 various entities so everything is
03:11:11.560 actually outsourced we just have people
03:11:13.600 to manage these different uh sections
03:11:16.359 and entities all righty done guys super
03:11:20.000 thank you
03:11:21.080 everyone you guys were all super patient
03:11:24.520 they used to season
03:11:26.270 [Music]
03:11:33.000 though SE hey one thing I forgot
03:11:35.720 marketing how did I forget that uh a big
03:11:39.920 part of a real estate company becoming a
03:11:43.279 brand is a is a factor of marketing what
03:11:46.439 kind of marketing helps in selling a
03:11:49.120 high value product like an apartment or
03:11:52.040 a commercial
03:11:53.920 space I think it's brand everywhere
03:11:56.720 plastered on the city newspaper still
03:11:59.319 that's work Billboards airport
03:12:02.000 Billboards which is why you'll see
03:12:04.279 everything that you land is like real
03:12:05.920 estate I mean that's why Builders I
03:12:07.680 think when you look at the newspaper
03:12:09.040 it's only Builders Builders magazines
03:12:11.319 newspapers radio you look at Billboards
03:12:14.200 over 7 Days probably Builders IPO page
03:12:16.800 then does again some
03:12:19.200 ipis um I think people have no
03:12:21.840 performance markeet there is now a lot
03:12:24.439 there is yeah there is like a lot more
03:12:26.439 digital marketing spin happening no one
03:12:30.560 that yeah but I I I again the the
03:12:33.160 mindset is still very traditional in
03:12:35.800 everything that you know happens within
03:12:37.640 real estate unless there's like
03:12:39.560 fresh blood and like someone younger
03:12:42.439 coming into the business and trying to
03:12:44.160 push technology push like you know
03:12:46.279 better ways of doing
03:12:48.479 um no but but I think it's also trust
03:12:51.239 thing is still referals I would say
03:12:53.040 referrals are a big part like 1/4 to
03:12:56.080 maybe even oneir some do you incentivize
03:12:59.040 referals bu so commission if you're a
03:13:02.479 registered broker then you get a a
03:13:04.720 commission what if I buy an apartment in
03:13:06.359 Brigade and I bring a friend to buy
03:13:08.080 another H you will get a either if you
03:13:10.720 have an apartment that you're also
03:13:12.000 buying you could get a discount on that
03:13:13.760 but if you want a commission you'll have
03:13:15.279 to register yourself as well you'll give
03:13:17.359 me a TV or a fidge or something no I
03:13:20.720 can't incentivize you like
03:13:22.840 that so if you register yourself and
03:13:25.520 there are some other ways actually that
03:13:27.080 you could do this uh incentivization in
03:13:29.479 kind there are some companies that help
03:13:31.000 you do that so one is referrals one is
03:13:34.200 um Channel Partners so
03:13:36.960 Brokers um and then the third is just um
03:13:40.040 Outreach
03:13:41.800 yeah uh that's
03:13:44.040 it yeah global
03:13:48.239 gcc's yeah yeah what are Global
03:13:51.720 capability centers
03:13:56.720 gccs is done it's really what your you
03:14:01.239 know accent and uh and TCS is all
03:14:05.239 started with which was really for large
03:14:07.840 large companies trying to digitize
03:14:09.840 offshoring basically but today it's I
03:14:13.680 think postco opened up to not just the
03:14:16.000 large business but pretty much any
03:14:19.040 business whether you're like a 100%
03:14:21.040 company 200% company a lot of them
03:14:23.000 actually start with us at you know we
03:14:25.760 work where they start with maybe like a
03:14:27.560 small amount of desks as they enter
03:14:30.040 India but it's essentially All Digital
03:14:33.359 transformation product development and
03:14:36.279 backend services that companies are
03:14:38.640 seeing the cost Arbitrage of you know
03:14:41.080 hiring and taking real estate in India
03:14:44.000 um purely because of the talent pool
03:14:46.720 Engish English speaking highly skilled
03:14:49.279 Engineers that you can't get you know
03:14:51.160 anywhere else in the world and I think
03:14:53.359 today the output has increased so much
03:14:57.120 so drastically that an engineer here is
03:14:59.200 as good as Sil as a Silicon Valley you
03:15:02.040 know type of engineer so what used to be
03:15:04.600 bpos and you know just call centers are
03:15:07.399 now full stack product development cyber
03:15:10.840 security R&D teams um you know Mercedes
03:15:15.760 as an example the entire the entire unit
03:15:18.600 the entire interactive system and every
03:15:20.600 Mercedes car gets built you know out of
03:15:23.720 India um so it's it's moved up the value
03:15:27.279 chain and uh postco I think people have
03:15:29.920 realized companies have realized that I
03:15:32.000 don't need to be housed in America or
03:15:34.800 Europe you know I can have a like a more
03:15:38.800 dispersed Workforce um which is a big
03:15:42.040 reason why commercial real estate in
03:15:43.399 India is booming still it's it's just
03:15:45.880 that flow that's coming from all over
03:15:48.479 the world so even like 20 seats some a
03:15:51.560 company taking 20 seats can be called a
03:15:53.359 GCC as long as they doing the kind of
03:15:55.760 work he mentioned and now the reason why
03:15:58.680 gcc's keep coming up is because from the
03:16:00.840 commercial office take up they're taking
03:16:02.680 up almost 28 to 30% of your office space
03:16:05.720 I think now co-working was at 25 26%
03:16:09.040 it's come down to
03:16:10.359 21% it has actually come down to maybe
03:16:13.720 10 to 15% from new space new office St
03:16:16.920 take off and a lot of the India facing
03:16:19.000 companies are the remaining 40 odd per
03:16:21.359 so I think gcc's are really helping the
03:16:23.760 whole office Market sustain its um yeah
03:16:27.439 it's shine I would say yeah
