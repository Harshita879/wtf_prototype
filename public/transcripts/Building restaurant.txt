00:00:00.359 this show uh is meant solely as an
00:00:06.600 exercise in education for
00:00:08.840 entrepreneurs uh I think this will be
00:00:11.360 incredibly useful to so many young
00:00:14.280 people who want to start a restaurant
00:00:15.839 this is a crash course in restauran
00:00:17.590 [Music]
00:00:28.960 thing
00:00:36.200 okay guys ready
00:00:38.870 [Music]
00:00:44.200 start hi guys thank you for uh flying
00:00:47.760 down to Bangalore on a Friday night on a
00:00:50.600 Friday night I hope this is not the
00:00:53.559 worst way to spend your Friday night
00:00:55.079 we'll try and make it as fun as we
00:00:57.440 can uh the the intent of this show is
00:01:02.719 very much not to make it about ourselves
00:01:05.960 uh so typically you know none of our
00:01:08.119 egos come into play or what we do too
00:01:11.200 much it's more focused on an
00:01:13.759 entrepreneur who wants to start a
00:01:15.400 restaurant I think pretty much everybody
00:01:17.640 wants to open one at some point in their
00:01:19.640 life they've thought of it I've thought
00:01:21.479 of it I've attempted it and failed a
00:01:23.159 bunch of times so we'll focus on that
00:01:26.920 and through the show let's try and cover
00:01:30.880 all that might be needed in opening a
00:01:35.439 restaurant and every point that we can
00:01:37.159 cover we'll try and approach let's start
00:01:40.240 with introductions uh let's start with
00:01:43.000 Puja first tell us about
00:01:45.759 you where do I start from from the
00:01:48.280 beginning from the
00:01:49.680 beginning so I'm from Bombay I grew up
00:01:52.040 there uh I started baking when I was six
00:01:54.040 years old uh with my aunt and I just
00:01:56.159 thought it was really beautiful simple
00:01:58.079 ingredients tell us a bit about your
00:01:59.159 parents as well um my parents or my dad
00:02:02.560 um ran his own business which was um
00:02:05.759 importing ball bearings and my mom was
00:02:08.639 uh a housewife and so she used to cook
00:02:11.038 and bake a lot so I used to bake with
00:02:13.360 her is there a lot of money in ball
00:02:15.239 bearings so what we trying to do is a
00:02:17.239 euphemized way of asking was your DED
00:02:19.319 wealthy um he wasn't
00:02:22.519 initially he he started off uh you know
00:02:26.800 he was kicked out from the family so he
00:02:28.519 had to start his own business it took
00:02:30.400 him a lot of time to kind of find his
00:02:32.319 ground um so we actually grew up with uh
00:02:35.760 you know being very conservative and
00:02:38.160 being told that you can't afford this
00:02:40.159 and you can't do that but they did the
00:02:41.680 best that they could for us right uh we
00:02:43.760 went to a good school and then as we
00:02:45.480 grew up like his business also did well
00:02:48.080 and then that kind of um you know we saw
00:02:51.599 him uh at least for me that was that was
00:02:54.360 a great sort of thing to see what you
00:02:55.959 can build from scratch and and I always
00:02:58.560 knew that if I had to do anything think
00:02:59.959 it would never be um a job I would
00:03:02.319 always do something of myself so and
00:03:04.080 things got better while you were in high
00:03:05.720 school or something things got better
00:03:06.879 when I was in high school and then I was
00:03:08.959 lucky enough to go um to study
00:03:12.080 Hospitality in Switzerland um followed
00:03:14.720 by culinary school in Paris and then
00:03:16.760 there was a stop cuz then I wanted to go
00:03:18.239 to Australia I didn't want to come back
00:03:20.000 I just wanted to go everywhere and they
00:03:21.599 said it's enough so before I went to
00:03:24.000 Paris I kind of spoke to them and told
00:03:26.040 them that this is my plan wait so you
00:03:28.360 went to which school in Bombay B
00:03:30.000 Scottish and you were there up until
00:03:32.159 what what age uh 10th standard then I
00:03:34.680 went to jind uh college for years and
00:03:37.040 you continued baking from age six along
00:03:39.280 the way along the way I was I was not a
00:03:42.120 very good student but I was very loved
00:03:44.159 and I was a teacher pet cuz every Monday
00:03:45.840 I was the kid who got brownies and
00:03:47.560 cookies and chocolates to class so
00:03:49.840 everyone loved me because of that and I
00:03:52.360 just saw the joy that deserved God you
00:03:54.560 know like for me that was like the start
00:03:56.159 of it and back then there was not too
00:03:58.439 much um that you could do with you know
00:04:00.920 you couldn't be a chef at least for a
00:04:02.239 girl that was unheard of what kind of
00:04:03.879 brownies H what kind of
00:04:07.000 brownies did it help the was 13 okay
00:04:10.680 they were normal chocolate brownies um
00:04:13.680 but yeah and then I actually thought I
00:04:15.640 wanted to do law so I joined law school
00:04:17.918 because you know being in the FNB world
00:04:20.440 at that point for a girl was just like
00:04:21.880 are you really going to do this and then
00:04:24.320 uh two weeks into law school I said this
00:04:25.919 is not for me and I went to them and I
00:04:27.919 said I want to quit and this said what
00:04:29.840 would you like to do I said own a cafe
00:04:31.840 someday get into Hospitality um said
00:04:34.560 okay education is important so I picked
00:04:36.639 Switzerland as a school mhm and uh spent
00:04:39.479 four years there worth it like going to
00:04:41.639 Switzerland to study oh man it was it
00:04:43.479 was incredible are there any options in
00:04:45.680 India at all to learn baking cooking
00:04:47.680 many many now many especially baking now
00:04:50.560 yes back then they want too many but do
00:04:52.560 they compare with the college you went
00:04:54.160 to I would say yes in fact LaVon in in
00:04:56.880 Bangalore is great I mean if it existed
00:04:59.280 when I I was younger I would have gone
00:05:00.960 there instead of going abroad really mhm
00:05:03.039 I go to Leon almost every weekend to
00:05:05.800 have avocado toast and coffee in the
00:05:07.800 morning breakfast really good place okay
00:05:10.680 so you went to Switzerland and then then
00:05:12.919 I went to Paris cuz in Switzerland I
00:05:14.960 work through different departments
00:05:16.560 realized that the pastry kitchen is
00:05:18.240 where the heart really is and then I
00:05:20.840 came back to them and told them I want
00:05:22.199 to go to Paris and my dad said it's too
00:05:24.199 expensive not right now and then I
00:05:25.800 convinced them I gave them a business
00:05:26.960 plan and said but I want to come back
00:05:28.800 and open this thing and I want to do
00:05:30.520 this and this and this and they somehow
00:05:32.759 believed me how expensive is it going to
00:05:35.680 a cooking school or baking School in um
00:05:39.360 back then this is now 16 years back um I
00:05:43.759 think the school in Paris was like 40
00:05:46.520 lakhs a year yeah and now it would be
00:05:49.880 today maybe 60 75 and that's your
00:05:53.560 four-year course what is it called uh
00:05:55.720 the there was a diploma in uh French
00:05:58.639 ptis that was in Paris and there was a
00:06:00.960 degree in hospitality and international
00:06:02.639 business in Switzerland okay and
00:06:05.319 typically somebody who goes to a college
00:06:07.199 like that and if they were to try and
00:06:08.680 get a job a is it easy and B how much do
00:06:11.199 they get paid so um at least for all my
00:06:14.840 so the interesting statistic is that
00:06:17.560 about 50 to 60 people that study go to
00:06:20.560 hospitality school don't end up in the
00:06:22.039 industry um they end up doing different
00:06:24.120 jobs um even pastry School actually not
00:06:26.280 too many people actually have stayed
00:06:27.759 back why is that it's a
00:06:30.880 hard it's extremely hard um and it's
00:06:34.240 tough and you know you you earn a lot
00:06:36.759 more if you do like a sales job or
00:06:38.120 something else right um so a lot of my
00:06:40.960 uh colleagues friends um got in with the
00:06:43.919 international chain so you get in with
00:06:45.280 the high Hilton you you know you do
00:06:47.080 programs with them travel um go to the
00:06:49.960 US do a management training program and
00:06:51.599 then you're with that Organization for
00:06:54.080 10 15 years like if you were to go to
00:06:55.960 college in Switzerland and come back do
00:06:57.759 you get paid more here
00:07:00.360 I think the degree of an International
00:07:03.879 Quality one like she has will definitely
00:07:06.599 give you a head up in the selection
00:07:09.000 process um but I think hotels especially
00:07:11.440 have a fairly regimented salary
00:07:13.720 structure so if you're coming in at a
00:07:15.199 certain position I don't think you're
00:07:17.440 going to get significantly more just
00:07:18.960 because you came out of a wonderful
00:07:20.120 school like hers probably going to get
00:07:21.879 paid the same but I think your career
00:07:24.000 path you know the expediency at at the
00:07:26.360 rate at which you'll grow could be
00:07:27.800 faster but I guess that's got more to do
00:07:29.879 with communication in fact when I came
00:07:31.280 back it was really hard for me to find a
00:07:32.960 job the reason I also started my own
00:07:34.400 thing right away and didn't work
00:07:35.440 anywhere because now 14 15 years ago
00:07:37.879 there weren't any Standalone restaurants
00:07:40.960 there was there were literally like a
00:07:42.360 couple of them and then all the hotels
00:07:43.960 usually just higher from the hotel
00:07:45.360 schools that uh they have so Taj will
00:07:47.840 only hire for mym ETC so it was it was
00:07:50.720 tough like I did a whole bunch of
00:07:52.000 interviews and then I was like okay just
00:07:55.120 got to do this okay so Switzerland you
00:07:57.479 studied hospitality diploma which took
00:08:00.080 how uh degree for four years four years
00:08:02.319 and then and then Paris for a year and
00:08:04.400 what did you study in Paris diploma in
00:08:06.080 French ptis for 9 months and then I
00:08:07.599 worked in a chocolate shop for three
00:08:09.159 months which was amazing and then you
00:08:11.840 came back to India and then I came back
00:08:13.759 to India in
00:08:15.199 201 10 and 20 2009 and um just saw that
00:08:20.879 you know there was um it actually felt
00:08:23.280 like all the hotels and restaurants kind
00:08:25.360 of had the same pastry chef cuz you got
00:08:27.280 like five desserts in in every where you
00:08:29.479 went and there was like that blueberry
00:08:31.159 cheesecake and you know and I think
00:08:34.039 mocha was the only one I have to say
00:08:35.919 that was differentiated thank you for
00:08:37.559 the pl Puja no but I told you I made the
00:08:41.279 Rohan and I made
00:08:42.839 the that chocolate uh the vertigo yeah
00:08:46.920 the Avalanche the Avalanche the
00:08:48.399 Avalanche Mo used had this chocolate
00:08:49.800 Avalanche was great um and so I fell in
00:08:52.680 love with macaroons when I was in Paris
00:08:54.720 I came back saw that everything was too
00:08:56.680 similar found that there was an
00:08:58.640 opportunity here decided to test it out
00:09:01.079 so started baking from my home kitchen
00:09:03.519 um I was in every Mall every event
00:09:06.600 everything and just got people to taste
00:09:08.680 it and I saw that people loved it and
00:09:11.480 2009 2010 got my first small 500t
00:09:15.079 kitchen started working with a team of
00:09:17.160 three and then where was this uh in low
00:09:19.760 parel in Bombay and slowly just you know
00:09:23.160 started I had my little kiosk at Good
00:09:25.680 Earth in um lower parel which was what
00:09:28.720 really helped us cuz it was the the same
00:09:30.959 exact target audience and then slowly
00:09:34.240 started doing caterings and parties I
00:09:36.000 was teaching a lot I was teaching baking
00:09:38.880 um I enjoy doing that is that a
00:09:40.959 profession that pays well to teaching it
00:09:44.000 does teaching at a college or like
00:09:46.120 personally no personally at a studio so
00:09:48.600 one didn't know what I learned in Paris
00:09:50.720 Etc so I said looked at it saw it as a
00:09:52.839 good opportunity and actually initially
00:09:56.079 the classes paid the bills more than the
00:09:58.560 pastry cuz everyone was like okay what
00:10:01.360 are you going to teach us today and I
00:10:02.560 would just do like week long sessions
00:10:04.160 and people would fly down from all over
00:10:05.560 India and come and do these classes and
00:10:07.680 you found them through social media no
00:10:09.839 back then there I used to have a Blog

00:10:15.240 you know um I used to have a Blog and
00:10:18.079 then just through
00:10:20.160 press yeah very interesting and then and
00:10:24.160 then I'm going to nudge you to talk a
00:10:26.399 little bit because I've heard you shy
00:10:29.680 and that's like an understatement she's
00:10:31.680 not getting paid by the word she's not
00:10:34.040 getting paid by the
00:10:35.680 word yeah
00:10:37.399 apparently right from the GetGo I think
00:10:40.399 uh she was one of the most celebrated
00:10:42.639 people in the industry nice thank you
00:10:45.480 she's the boss lady of macaroons in
00:10:46.920 India boss lady she's just a boss lady

00:12:11.320 that were happening cuz you're so like

00:13:03.240 customers already there you don't have
00:13:04.600 to spend um anything to and at that time
00:13:07.839 social media didn't exist so marketing
00:13:09.480 and acquisition was so different anyway
00:13:11.560 but it was great um and then the cafe
00:13:14.560 was the big dream which I started in
00:13:17.160 Kaba which was uh really like it was a
00:13:20.199 piece of my heart and then we opened
00:13:22.360 another CA a quintessential French cafe

00:13:33.440 the Eiffel Tower is so I loved living in
00:13:36.199 Paris it was home away from home so when
00:13:38.240 I moved back I wanted people to have the
00:13:40.120 same feeling when they walked into our
00:13:42.279 stores or ate any of our products to
00:13:44.240 feel like they were transported there so
00:13:47.000 okay and then you started all this
00:13:48.880 started all this everything was going
00:13:50.600 great raised some money to expand to
00:13:53.360 scale from customers of L 15 that became
00:13:56.240 friends that really wanted um to be a
00:13:59.120 part of the growth Journey um and then
00:14:01.800 Co happened which was quite difficult we
00:14:05.360 had to shut down the cafes because it
00:14:07.639 was just too challenging to keep them
00:14:09.320 going have you been able to reopen them
00:14:11.560 no I think we just I just pivoted and it
00:14:13.720 said I just looked at it from you know
00:14:16.320 more of a business lens and said what is
00:14:17.839 it that you know I really want to do and
00:14:19.480 how can I achieve scale I do want to do
00:14:21.880 a cafe someday again maybe like a
00:14:23.600 dessert cafe or a a dessert bar uh but
00:14:26.320 for now it's just focusing on how can we
00:14:29.279 open in more cities how can we get uh a
00:14:31.959 cookis and macarons and scale them and
00:14:34.040 have them everywhere so that's what we
00:14:36.000 we've been working on and personal life
00:14:38.880 I'm going to focus on you for a while
00:14:40.600 okay I'm like interesting a it's like
00:14:43.680 we're getting insights that we would not
00:14:45.360 get who exciting news to report oh my
00:14:48.320 God what's my exciting new is there a
00:14:49.959 new boyfriend there is a new boyfriend

00:15:40.519 question you either way so you might as
00:15:42.040 well you know yeah but I think that she
00:15:43.440 doesn't want them hearing it on a
00:15:44.720 podcast right yeah yeah yeah um I've
00:15:49.040 also written I'm going to divert it now
00:15:51.759 seven those books yeah wow amazing
00:15:54.120 Master Chef and Master Chef is on right
00:15:56.079 now I have a podcast called No Sugar cat
00:15:58.440 which which basically I was really
00:15:59.759 frustrated with everyone just saying
00:16:01.360 that life is a piece of cake and life is
00:16:03.440 a cake walk and I was like it's really
00:16:04.720 not it's like hard and it's tough and
00:16:07.560 everyone just sees you know the the 1%
00:16:10.079 of success but the backstory is quite
00:16:12.480 different so I started having these
00:16:13.959 conversations with people from FNB world
00:16:17.040 and the new season is out soon Raz is on
00:16:20.199 in this season are you an outgo P
00:16:24.440 um wow this podcast is
00:16:27.519 really where are we going it's a proper
00:16:30.279 intergation there's a there's a lamp
00:16:38.040 head you
00:16:40.399 huh mom hasn't asked me so many question
00:16:42.839 I think the mom has gotten in touch with
00:16:44.319 him like what's going he's the vessel
00:16:46.160 through which the questions are being
00:16:47.240 asked I spoke to her okay I'll tell you
00:16:49.480 something I did so ah so um before coid
00:16:54.040 I was a very different person um I was a
00:16:56.519 person who thought everyone was was her
00:16:58.800 best friend and everyone was I was close
00:17:00.480 to everybody and then I actually started
00:17:03.319 seeing a leadership coach uh during coid
00:17:06.480 um and changed a lot of the way I I view
00:17:09.359 myself the way I view life would you
00:17:11.000 like to tell us more about that change
00:17:12.439 yourself how um I always felt very um
00:17:16.199 underconfidence
00:17:17.439 and with the finance and business part
00:17:20.240 of uh of low 15 um because I just I I'm
00:17:24.160 a creative person um the baking is great
00:17:27.480 marketing all of that is great but when
00:17:29.000 it comes to finance I feel like I was
00:17:31.160 never and for most girls right you're
00:17:33.240 never spoken to and told this is how you
00:17:36.720 should run your finances what should
00:17:38.720 mean like even all my friends now either
00:17:41.039 their husbands or their fathers invest
00:17:42.799 their money not too many people not many
00:17:45.000 girls actually doing that themselves um
00:17:48.160 and so I was always I always felt like I
00:17:50.200 didn't know enough and I had like an
00:17:52.919 accountant who stole a lot of money from
00:17:54.360 me made me
00:17:56.159 really like it it it put me through
00:17:58.679 quite a bit is this something you would
00:18:00.280 recommend when we went around looking at
00:18:02.960 the participation of women in restaurant
00:18:06.000 ownership the number is abysmally low uh
00:18:09.360 which is uncanny because unlike other
00:18:12.400 Industries women tend to be better Cooks
00:18:14.799 right I mean historically and culturally
00:18:17.200 women have they are managers yeah yeah
00:18:19.600 especially multitasking but it's it's
00:18:22.360 not really at least now it's changing
00:18:24.080 and we we see a lot of women um in the
00:18:26.760 kitchen as well not only the pastry
00:18:28.039 kitchen but also in the the hot kitchen
00:18:30.000 but 15 20 years ago it was unheard of
00:18:33.280 you know it wasn't it is a very like
00:18:35.320 male dominated the kitchen a
00:18:37.640 professional kitchen tends to be uh very
00:18:40.799 like why is that though it's long hours
00:18:43.640 it's tougher parents don't want their
00:18:46.280 daughters to do that like it's it's a
00:18:48.240 lot of cultural you know I think but
00:18:50.200 it's very high stress no but can I can
00:18:52.280 we please not make it about being a boy
00:18:55.159 club because it's not okay the fact
00:18:57.960 remains that that it's a cultural sticky
00:19:01.240 people don't want uh daughters I mean
00:19:07.360 i'ms I agree I agree but the taboo is
00:19:10.720 not because it's a boys club it is a
00:19:12.480 boys club because somebody needs to do
00:19:14.640 that but it's not because uh women tend
00:19:18.159 to if they get into the hospitality
00:19:19.880 business they tend to gravitate towards
00:19:21.280 pastry they do marketing and HR right we
00:19:24.440 are seeing some women now standing up
00:19:26.480 and handling the Hot Kitchen which is
00:19:27.960 great we seeing more women mixologist
00:19:30.280 coming up we the best Indian mixologist
00:19:33.159 was a woman so the glass ceilings are
00:19:35.200 being broke but it is also a cultural uh
00:19:40.159 you know a stock broker yeah Soldier and
00:19:43.080 a chef in a busy kitchen are three of
00:19:45.080 the most stressful jobs in the world
00:19:47.039 statistical fact so it's a high stress
00:19:49.280 environment tends to be a lot of
00:19:50.559 shouting a little bit of that the good
00:19:52.320 thing is is changing within our system
00:19:54.120 we're seeing some of our most successful
00:19:55.600 restaurants even overseas being run
00:19:57.760 entirely by uh a female head chef and it
00:20:00.960 works beautifully there is something
00:20:02.760 about the finesse that lady chefs are
00:20:05.960 able to get there's something about an
00:20:08.600 empathetic nature that they're about to
00:20:10.760 generate a habit at an environment that
00:20:13.280 is nicer softer more creative it's just
00:20:16.960 natural I might be a little I might be I
00:20:19.480 guess making statements based on my own
00:20:21.480 experience but I genuinely feel that
00:20:23.679 this is the way this is the effect that
00:20:25.799 ladies have on any environment that they
00:20:28.000 have
00:20:29.039 it's just the nature of the the gender I
00:20:31.640 mean I think they just have this and
00:20:32.880 then management a detail orientedness of
00:20:35.640 our female shf is marketly superior I
00:20:38.640 would say this I would I've noticed this
00:20:40.799 the Finesse the beauty delicacy it's
00:20:43.280 just there right what else changed you
00:20:46.280 said pre-o postco yeah um the first
00:20:49.039 thing my leadership coach Made Me Do Is
00:20:51.360 Make a list of 10 people in my life that
00:20:53.720 were most important why and why do they
00:20:56.080 belong there um and that really like for
00:21:00.880 me moved things around because then it's
00:21:02.640 like the these are the opinions that
00:21:04.600 matter and this is really what matters
00:21:07.080 everything else is noise and you can
00:21:09.200 talk to 10 million people and do
00:21:11.480 everything else but this is where it's
00:21:13.360 at and you consciously cut out everyone
00:21:15.120 else I didn't consciously cut out
00:21:17.120 everyone but everyone else became not as
00:21:19.559 important as as as the 10 core you know
00:21:22.200 cuz then this is who is in that go I
00:21:25.120 will not say that as well you get me
00:21:28.320 into trouble why this is not like a put
00:21:31.520 put you in trouble kind of thing see
00:21:33.840 because we have never met before I feel
00:21:35.919 like the fastest way for me to get to
00:21:39.240 know you is ask you things you wouldn't
00:21:40.840 normally talk about correct cuz then I
00:21:43.360 know you really quickly and we can cut
00:21:45.799 the get to know each other time by a
00:21:48.120 wide
00:21:49.240 margin would you like to name that coach
00:21:51.480 so if other people want sure her name is
00:21:53.559 anuya Menan and she works out of Bombay
00:21:56.440 so other people can reach out and take
00:21:58.279 help as well we did a lot of background
00:22:00.679 research and you know we know you know
00:22:03.039 the basics this is not Equitable we
00:22:05.559 don't know anything about you we don't
00:22:07.279 know anything about you this this is
00:22:10.480 like a forensic audit it I'm worried
00:22:12.840 what all you know what all kind of dirt
00:22:14.480 you've pulled out on us the two of us I
00:22:16.799 don't have any dirt a lot Clean Slate a
00:22:20.720 lot a lot okay super thank you Puja and
00:22:24.320 sorry for pushing you a little bit now
00:22:26.679 you guys can over yet it's not over
00:22:30.440 yet yeah so we're going to like scratch
00:22:33.279 it a little bit and come back and
00:22:34.919 scratch the same wound again after some
00:22:36.559 time so you get a break some respite so
00:22:39.279 I know Zar a little bit we met recently
00:22:41.799 and hung out uh and a wonderful Cafe at
00:22:45.200 a wonderful Cafe in Goa yes yeah and I
00:22:48.279 know a little run by another fantastic
00:22:49.799 female restaurant tour yeah nth ATA yes
00:22:53.480 ATA yeah I think she's doing a great job
00:22:55.559 with health food right I thought the
00:22:56.840 food was great yeah you guys ordered so
00:22:58.760 much food I know I just had lunch but
00:23:00.559 everything looked so good I still dug in
00:23:02.960 but you're on a diet or something you
00:23:04.200 barely ate I I'm am trying I'm trying my
00:23:07.240 best okay but my diets I have a yo-yo
00:23:09.960 life with diets you know my diets are on
00:23:12.360 and off and on and off and I've figured
00:23:13.919 out that what really works long run for
00:23:16.960 me is simple portion control nothing is
00:23:19.919 more sustainable than just limiting the
00:23:22.360 amount of food that you eat and then
00:23:24.360 perhaps not eat after 6 6:30 7 hard to
00:23:27.480 do in our of business because I think
00:23:29.640 food the love for food is the most
00:23:31.760 noblest of all loves it's God's gift to
00:23:35.760 mankind it literally is it's the only
00:23:37.880 thing think about it that you can do
00:23:40.120 three times a day every single day and
00:23:41.880 never get bored there is another great
00:23:43.799 thing he's given us but I don't think we
00:23:44.880 can do that three times a day yeah yeah
00:23:46.640 sorry yeah food is divine food is just
00:23:48.720 love and my growing up in the kind of
00:23:50.760 family that I did food was the absolute
00:23:53.760 centerpiece of our existence I mean my
00:23:56.840 daddy was actually what got my father
00:23:58.720 into it my father is carved out a niche
00:24:01.600 for himself um I'm
00:24:04.880 so unbelievably proud of my father I
00:24:07.880 think he really brought about a
00:24:09.960 Renaissance for Indian food and growing
00:24:12.039 up in jigs scra's house was literally
00:24:14.480 all about great food exposure from a
00:24:16.880 very young age I remember I had kavar at
00:24:18.720 the age of eight or nine he made me eat
00:24:21.559 something as as as peculiar as anchois
00:24:25.559 by hiding it in cream cheese when I was
00:24:27.200 10 literally the kind of stuff that he
00:24:29.399 would do because it was his passion he
00:24:31.480 lived for food in fact the country's
00:24:33.760 first syndicated colum in food at The
00:24:36.120 Illustrated weekly with kushan Singh was
00:24:38.480 my dad's column wow started off as a
00:24:40.480 journalist became a foodie became a food
00:24:42.760 writer and then he did what he did put
00:24:44.360 Indian food on the and where did you
00:24:45.760 grow up Delhi grew up uh in Delhi uh has
00:24:49.159 your was your dad like a career uh when
00:24:51.880 did he start cooking like when did this
00:24:53.480 become a profession for him journalism
00:24:55.399 and then this yes so you know he's
00:24:58.320 written many books and some of these
00:25:00.960 some of these books especially prashad
00:25:02.399 has become like a common stay at
00:25:04.039 catering Colleges and Schools it's it's
00:25:06.200 literally used as a tool to make people
00:25:08.000 learn cooking he was never a chef he was
00:25:10.799 a journalist who simply had a god-given
00:25:13.320 pallet and his pallet was so Sublime
00:25:15.960 that he could work with the great Chefs
00:25:17.679 of India and improve recipes but more
00:25:20.679 than that he was a
00:25:22.000 historian he devoted his life to
00:25:25.240 documenting researching and then you
00:25:27.159 know recording
00:25:28.360 Indian food because unlike French or
00:25:31.039 German or you know Japanese any any of
00:25:32.840 these Cuisines are fairly well
00:25:34.000 documented there are standardized
00:25:35.279 recipes in India we had this Kama
00:25:37.919 culture where these really good cooks
00:25:40.200 and chefs want to hide recipes so the
00:25:42.640 recipes were never documented and they
00:25:43.919 were all over the place you know even
00:25:45.480 you have so much passion when you speak
00:25:47.039 about your father has that relationship
00:25:50.159 changed from when you were a kid to when
00:25:52.480 you were a teenager to an adult to now
00:25:55.679 what
00:25:56.679 works it from a combination of fear and
00:26:03.039 awe to unbelievable respect somewhere in
00:26:06.520 the middle to copious amounts of Love
00:26:10.919 towards the end of his life how old is z
00:26:12.880 now unfortunately passed on in
00:26:15.720 2019 after a 19-year battle uh with
00:26:19.039 stroke so he actually had a big Stroke
00:26:21.840 by the way a lot of the viewers will
00:26:22.919 think stroke is related to the heart
00:26:24.240 it's got nothing to do with the heart
00:26:25.559 it's a brain infar
00:26:28.200 and it left his left side paralled
00:26:30.360 paralyzed in fact he was the most
00:26:32.000 frequent flyer in India and overnight he
00:26:35.159 became bedridden for 19 years wow and it
00:26:38.520 was probably the worst week of my life I
00:26:40.159 lo I I I I was 22 years old I was thrust
00:26:43.720 into the wide world with all this
00:26:47.240 responsibility an absolute sense of fear
00:26:51.200 and ambiguity I didn't know what what's
00:26:54.120 going to happen my biggest fear was is
00:26:55.640 he going to live cuz I didn't know what
00:26:57.360 to stroke was most of India didn't know
00:26:59.360 what what a stroke was many people today
00:27:01.399 and I've spent a lot of time by the way
00:27:02.720 working on you know trying to spread the
00:27:05.039 knowledge of what a stroke is so that if
00:27:06.279 it happens to your house in your house
00:27:07.960 God forbid you're able to take action
00:27:09.760 this by the way is the biggest fear for
00:27:11.080 me like if somebody were to Define one
00:27:14.480 fear I have in life it's probably
00:27:19.000 regretting not spending time with my
00:27:21.120 father when I could have and uh you know
00:27:24.039 beyond a certain point it's not the same
00:27:26.159 the quality of the time spent is not the
00:27:28.200 same because they're not as mobile
00:27:30.039 they're not able to do many of the
00:27:32.000 things they might have done when they
00:27:33.120 were younger what part of your current
00:27:35.919 journey is his journey that you're
00:27:38.559 trying to complete everything every
00:27:41.799 single thing is is it the same recipes
00:27:44.799 which are continuing they found they
00:27:47.240 they are the basis and the foundation of
00:27:48.799 everything I've ever done whether it's
00:27:50.519 modern everything related to Indian of
00:27:51.960 course I have other brands everything
00:27:53.559 but you do burgers and everything yeah
00:27:55.200 so obviously limited but actually
00:27:57.640 technically he has given me exposure to
00:28:01.200 my pette he's given exposure to my
00:28:02.679 pallet so technically even stuff that he
00:28:05.080 did not engag and he he only did Indian
00:28:06.880 food he focused purely on Indian food it
00:28:09.279 was his love his personal Crusade was to
00:28:12.240 put Indian food on the global pallet and
00:28:14.159 he devoted 40 Years of his life to it
00:28:15.799 the best way on Earth to export your
00:28:18.320 culture is through your food and he did
00:28:20.840 that every morning I wake up I feel a
00:28:24.440 baton is being passed on to me so
00:28:26.559 actually the real goal of of our company
00:28:28.799 is not to just open restaurants but
00:28:30.679 literally to put Indian food on the
00:28:32.000 global pallet permanently where I can't
00:28:35.080 dream I mean I cannot help but dream of
00:28:38.120 a day where maybe a decade from now or
00:28:39.960 even earlier every top city in the world
00:28:43.640 a diner or a tourist considers an Indian
00:28:45.960 restaurant as one of the three dining
00:28:47.720 destinations and I think Indian food is
00:28:50.080 the greatest cuisine on Earth it has the
00:28:52.279 deepest culinary philosophy it has a
00:28:54.799 sophistication that is completely
00:28:56.399 unparalleled it has a variety that is
00:28:59.600 you know a simple state will have more
00:29:02.000 vegetarian food variety than entire
00:29:04.159 continents that's the depth and the you
00:29:06.559 know sophistication and the the sheer
00:29:08.600 intellectual property that our ancestors
00:29:10.360 left behind and it's up to us and it's
00:29:12.840 literally our responsibility to make
00:29:15.720 sure that the world recognizes it for a
00:29:18.440 lot of people this relationship father
00:29:21.919 son working in one business is very
00:29:25.080 complicated right each
00:29:28.360 is coming from a certain place of
00:29:30.120 insecurity like one is trying to hold
00:29:32.919 his prevalence for the lack of other
00:29:35.760 word and the other is trying to create
00:29:38.039 his own identity what do you think
00:29:40.200 worked for you guys if it worked as a
00:29:43.000 father and son working together that you
00:29:45.159 were able to manage the egos associated
00:29:49.519 with a situation like this my father was
00:29:52.880 a cusp between a Taurus and a Gemini
00:29:55.320 although I don't think he had any Gemini
00:29:56.679 in him I think he was all bull so very
00:30:00.039 tough guy very demanding person and had
00:30:02.960 a big
00:30:03.799 ego uh he also had a short temper and
00:30:07.919 maybe genetically I got some of these
00:30:09.720 aspects within me as
00:30:14.600 well are you like him I am in many ways
00:30:18.000 I think he's the little bit I know you
00:30:19.960 you sounded like you described him just
00:30:21.840 now would you
00:30:24.919 agree I
00:30:28.399 I I genuinely think that a a son because
00:30:32.559 of the awe in which he places his father
00:30:35.000 is going to be you know heavily
00:30:37.519 influenced by what their father does and
00:30:40.200 in some subconscious way or maybe in
00:30:41.840 some generic way I don't know starts
00:30:44.000 emulating them so in some ways I think
00:30:46.159 it could be a subconscious reaction in
00:30:48.080 some ways it could be an active uh
00:30:50.200 learning like I saw him solve issues in
00:30:52.880 a certain way so I think oh wait a
00:30:54.559 minute as a child this is the right way
00:30:56.000 to do it uh we were a fairly disciplined
00:30:59.399 house in some ways I do emulate him but
00:31:02.360 I think growing up because he got sick
00:31:04.480 and was not as actively involved in the
00:31:06.480 business as he would have liked to be it
00:31:08.440 worked I have a feeling I would not have
00:31:10.720 been able to work for him so I think
00:31:12.000 it's Destiny that I was able to take the
00:31:14.559 reins and then I had this incredible
00:31:17.000 figure behind me as my mentor and my
00:31:19.360 support watching my back and the the in
00:31:23.240 the inherited Goodwill that I've got
00:31:25.120 from him has helped me immensely and I
00:31:27.000 made no bones about it I don't think I
00:31:29.440 would have had success as quickly had I
00:31:33.120 not been jig scra's son I don't know man
00:31:36.679 I think uh you did him proud very
00:31:39.440 quickly I think he was one of the first
00:31:40.880 people I remember Punjab girl was when I
00:31:43.880 first met him and I said that there's
00:31:46.240 something here somebody there's a bright
00:31:48.360 restauran in mind behind this product
00:31:50.200 because you know all the touch points
00:31:52.399 beautifully covered and at that point of
00:31:53.840 time also he just started off on his
00:31:55.360 mission to put Indian food back it was
00:31:59.760 till I think
00:32:00.919 about
00:32:03.200 200 I think maybe
00:32:06.399 2005 Indian food was everybody's guilty
00:32:08.960 pleasure nobody would admit to eating
00:32:11.720 Indian food they would only go to
00:32:13.120 European restaurants nobody used to go
00:32:15.240 out to Indian restaurants anymore it's
00:32:17.039 not cool and then you came in and you
00:32:18.639 changed all of that and and I think that
00:32:20.840 everybody only said zor you never heard
00:32:23.480 zor galra so uh you did
00:32:28.279 P shot that was
00:32:30.159 there was the P shot it became a rage
00:32:33.080 that became a rage I remember it so you
00:32:34.519 went to NBA Boston tell us a bit about
00:32:37.320 that MBA in what MBA in um Information
00:32:40.440 Systems Mis and uh why did you not know
00:32:43.639 up until then that you're going to do
00:32:45.000 this always then probably pre 10 years
00:32:48.960 so maybe when I was 11 12 I decided this
00:32:51.120 is all I want to do I was in awe of my
00:32:52.760 father I saw his lifestyle I saw the way
00:32:55.440 you know he was given respect he was on
00:32:57.039 TV by the way the first TV show in India
00:33:00.120 ever was my father's show while you were
00:33:02.880 your father yeah did the ego of a young
00:33:05.960 teenager also want to supersede the
00:33:09.240 father while you loved your father did
00:33:11.559 you want to lose the name and be called
00:33:15.279 zor to be honest never psychology big
00:33:18.120 fan to be honest not even for a second
00:33:21.000 would I ever have I always thought how
00:33:22.919 can I harness his
00:33:25.000 Goodwill and how can I learn from him
00:33:27.639 yeah and and I was fine him being the
00:33:29.960 head but my being part of the journey to
00:33:32.840 be honest even though that's not my like
00:33:35.399 I would never work if I were to work for
00:33:37.039 anybody in this world it would probably
00:33:38.080 be only for my father I don't have a a
00:33:41.360 bent of mind like Puja just said she's
00:33:44.720 she said that she she doesn't see
00:33:46.200 herself working for but Z I know you
00:33:47.840 you're a very
00:33:49.240 opinionated stronge headed person who
00:33:51.600 believes in a certain thing and will
00:33:53.039 fight for it so working with your dad
00:33:56.399 they must have been points of
00:33:57.840 contradiction every
00:34:00.240 day what what went on in your head at
00:34:02.760 that point so firstly I was very clear
00:34:05.600 that this is all I want to do I wanted
00:34:07.000 to be in the food space I used to love
00:34:09.040 hotels but I realized very soon that my
00:34:11.079 passion is really for food not really
00:34:12.719 for building these big structures and
00:34:14.399 you know running rooms and the idea and
00:34:17.320 the sole purpose of pursuing the MBA was
00:34:20.239 to arm myself with the knowledge and the
00:34:22.320 knowhow to be able to run a business at
00:34:25.440 scale and I was always going to come
00:34:27.719 back and be in the restaurant business
00:34:29.119 there was simply no other way around in
00:34:31.199 fact my father was responsible for
00:34:33.119 building some of the most famous
00:34:34.239 restaurants bukara D I mean these are
00:34:37.599 institutional restaurants also now
00:34:39.520 Punjab grills Bai Masala Library Louis
00:34:43.280 burer papaya so many that was the RO
00:34:46.599 Club yeah thank you so much for that but
00:34:48.918 those are still you know came about
00:34:51.159 later but he used to own he did not used
00:34:53.639 to own those and I used to think yeah
00:34:55.760 what it would be great if I the most of
00:34:57.760 these started Beyond him time all of
00:35:00.400 these started after he was fully so
00:35:02.160 Punjab girl was the first one that I
00:35:03.760 started while he was still hail and
00:35:05.520 Hearty in a way uh although farzy Cafe
00:35:08.040 also came about that time he was already
00:35:09.320 10 years into the stroke uh but even
00:35:12.200 before I got into the business he'd
00:35:13.560 built so at one point in time out of the
00:35:15.480 10 top grossing restaurants of India
00:35:18.000 five were made by one man that included
00:35:20.760 things like great Kebab Factory dumuk
00:35:23.520 bukara sing sahab so many restaurants
00:35:26.079 he'd made what
00:35:27.680 worked his passion food marketing
00:35:31.480 branding location like if you had to
00:35:34.000 point at one factor that really worked
00:35:36.160 at that time what for him he was very
00:35:38.760 good at rallying the entire media around
00:35:42.960 his creation and he was in that sense
00:35:45.640 able to in those days when the only
00:35:47.359 thing that worked there was no there was
00:35:49.319 not even mobile phone was the was the
00:35:51.560 newspaper and he had complete Command of
00:35:53.440 the
00:35:54.040 newspaper but then I think beyond that
00:35:56.359 it was the product till today the most
00:35:58.880 successful restaurant in India is bukara
00:36:01.359 hasn't changed its menu I love that
00:36:02.760 place by the way the Dal man yeah the D
00:36:06.240 and even that huge Roti they so yeah
00:36:09.599 yeah it's probably like 3,000 calories a
00:36:12.400 meal though right oh it could be even
00:36:14.680 more don't go for dinner if you want to
00:36:16.040 sleep that
00:36:17.079 night right and eventually all Indians
00:36:20.119 all delites just love going there for
00:36:21.960 dinner it's packed it's packed for lunch
00:36:23.960 too it's it's one of my favorite
00:36:25.960 restaurants and
00:36:27.440 uh but I would never go there for a
00:36:28.680 dinner but it's a show off restaurant
00:36:30.520 and ly right that ly is like 2,000
00:36:33.560 calories by itself the only restaurant
00:36:35.480 where the MD of ITC gets involved if the
00:36:37.920 menu needs to change really yeah and and
00:36:40.560 he never gets involved because they
00:36:41.599 haven't changed it they can't even they
00:36:43.440 can't even move they can't even move us
00:36:45.240 like they can't move one of the toools
00:36:47.280 they can't do that either it's it's
00:36:49.880 highly regimented and personal lives are
00:36:53.240 our I've heard I don't know if I'm right
00:36:55.880 or wrong actually actually I have seen
00:36:58.280 that men like yourself good-looking uh
00:37:02.240 restaurant owners and bar owners are
00:37:05.440 very popular with women no where have I
00:37:08.839 been

00:37:46.000 which you ask questions is making me
00:37:48.040 open up danger I would not it didn't
00:37:49.880 work on her I everything to I told you
00:37:53.200 what about your siblings I have one
00:37:55.440 brother M uh good
00:37:57.880 relationship uh he lives in the US he's
00:38:00.480 now just started opening restaurants of
00:38:02.640 his own
00:38:04.200 RI you had a black belt in karate no way
00:38:08.480 I had a brown
00:38:10.599 belt it says black on Google don't read
00:38:14.079 that stuff what happened was it
00:38:17.040 restaurants uh no I think somebody broke
00:38:20.040 my
00:38:21.000 nose yeah get half my size broke my nose
00:38:25.160 yeah yeah I think my nose and my e both
00:38:27.079 took a beating did you give up on it no
00:38:30.280 I think it fell away uh I used to I used
00:38:33.040 to play
00:38:36.800 Nos and you guys you know this is not
00:38:39.160 like one-on-one conversation this is all
00:38:41.400 four of us talking to each other so feel
00:38:43.200 free to butt in he's a good budy of mine
00:38:44.760 very good
00:38:46.079 ex tell us something about him that he
00:38:48.400 would not like to tell us by I'm half
00:38:50.560 par so my nose is correct certain shape
00:38:55.079 a certain yeah I know that that shape
00:38:57.319 went away with
00:39:01.359 that he is a softy at heart but he does
00:39:04.960 not like to um and I mean that in a
00:39:07.920 positive very positive manner he is a
00:39:11.480 empathetic leader I have not seen
00:39:16.560 a confrontational side of his of his yet
00:39:21.319 and I think that's a very good boss to
00:39:23.480 have but he's a good he's a soft leader
00:39:26.720 and heart leader I'm talking about
00:39:28.240 leader I'm not talking about
00:39:29.119 confrontation from outside perspective
00:39:31.040 he's a successful businessman he cannot
00:39:32.920 be that unless he knows how to look
00:39:34.359 after his
00:39:35.280 interests um so that's the one thing I
00:39:37.359 think what do you think is we can cut
00:39:39.680 this part out if you like sir you know
00:39:41.720 if you had like because maybe somebody's
00:39:43.560 watching this who can do something about
00:39:45.040 it three regulations that need to change
00:39:48.160 top of the pie what would you say why do
00:39:50.359 I need a police permission to sell a
00:39:53.240 sandwich I mean why why do I need to get
00:39:55.800 a character
00:39:56.920 certificate from police station to say
00:39:59.400 I'm worthy of selling a glass of beer or
00:40:03.280 to be able to sell what what business
00:40:05.079 does police have in my Affairs right um
00:40:10.160 I could have a big Mega stor and see 10
00:40:13.000 times the volume of the amount of people
00:40:15.119 comeing to restaurant why does
00:40:17.359 restaurants need to have police license
00:40:19.319 for example why do license it yeah
00:40:22.119 police license we need a police nooc for
00:40:24.000 everything that we do so if you want a
00:40:26.480 food license you to go get a police
00:40:28.079 clearance first first then they will
00:40:30.200 give it to you you want a fire NC you to
00:40:32.480 go to the police then they'll give it to
00:40:33.640 you you want an excise license you need
00:40:34.839 a policey then they'll give it to you
00:40:36.280 I'm guessing this is like a layer which
00:40:38.280 adds the cost as well cost and
00:40:41.079 unnecessary right like what is the logic
00:40:43.440 you know it's easy to get a gun at home
00:40:46.319 you require fewer character certificates
00:40:48.640 and fewer licenses and fewer checks to
00:40:51.240 get a gun at home than to get a get a
00:40:53.960 liquor license or to sell a sandwich
00:40:56.960 and um I think it's just absolutely
00:40:59.480 unnecessary and it's so by the way just
00:41:02.359 to put things in perspective the
00:41:04.880 restaurant industry overall is the
00:41:08.079 second highest employer of human capital
00:41:10.160 in India after
00:41:11.280 agriculture 10 million people directly
00:41:13.280 employed is only going to grow
00:41:14.960 compounded annually we're growing at
00:41:16.160 around 21% which means every three and a
00:41:18.400 half OD years you're doubling in size so
00:41:20.000 number of people employed will double in
00:41:21.920 size so it's a very important industry
00:41:24.359 what is the purpose of having of of
00:41:26.920 dissuading people from entering the
00:41:28.560 field that is doing a noble cause
00:41:30.599 sustance you're giving food you're
00:41:31.960 giving it's a necessity technically you
00:41:34.200 just need three licenses right you need
00:41:36.800 you need tax you need health to make
00:41:40.160 sure that you're going to make sure that
00:41:42.000 uh you know people are and you need
00:41:43.800 safety right you need to make sure that
00:41:46.079 it's fire compliant you need to make
00:41:47.760 sure that it's designed in a manner
00:41:49.599 which is not hazardous to the
00:41:51.200 environment to the
00:41:53.160 customers what other licenses would you
00:41:55.319 need and why do you we even need a
00:41:56.720 license for example but yeah we still
00:41:59.040 we're still grappling with 36 I think
00:42:01.280 after many years of struggle I think uh
00:42:04.760 U we've been able to get it from 36 to
00:42:07.400 32 wow
00:42:10.280 yeah so police number one then police
00:42:13.119 license after that uh so again why do
00:42:15.520 you need police license why is it that
00:42:18.359 um we are regulated with our timings
00:42:21.839 right I mean the fact that uh why why is
00:42:25.480 it again is again it's a issue like you
00:42:27.839 can only serve from this time to this
00:42:30.280 time and then you cannot serve after
00:42:32.440 that or before that whereas is there a
00:42:34.599 rule before that as well yeah yeah
00:42:37.839 yeah I thought only in the night like
00:42:39.960 Beyond 1:00 a.m. 2 a.m. but then I get
00:42:41.800 shut at one and open up at 2 know that
00:42:43.880 doesn't work so um hotels Allowed by the
00:42:47.280 way yeah Hotel allow 24hour license um
00:42:52.040 the excise uh licenses again crazy uh
00:42:56.280 very highly regulated very very
00:42:58.720 expensive um it's it's still today
00:43:02.200 restaurants are almost treated like uh a
00:43:05.520 rich man's Indulgence which is to be
00:43:09.000 ignored rather than the infrastructure
00:43:12.640 provider that restaurants are right it's
00:43:14.839 it's uh we're literally participating in
00:43:18.000 place building we we are growing
00:43:19.720 communities we bringing people together
00:43:22.200 we're not just about food and drink but
00:43:24.000 we're also about culture there's we
00:43:27.359 double up as public spaces which India
00:43:29.520 suffers from the lack of in a big way so
00:43:31.920 we have the added responsibility of of
00:43:34.520 public spaces where people can commune
00:43:36.359 with each other uh we also cultural
00:43:39.520 spaces where you know I mean you can't
00:43:41.920 go and perform in big halls but you know
00:43:44.480 every artist every musician every spoken
00:43:47.040 word artist has got the break first in a
00:43:49.960 restaurant so um there are many things
00:43:52.599 that restaurants bring to the table but
00:43:54.640 uh unfortunately it's not seen in a
00:43:57.200 favorable light right now so you have a
00:44:00.319 Pary mother yes grew up in Bombay grew
00:44:03.800 up born and inbred in Bombay
00:44:07.640 as what is what is that like I've heard
00:44:11.359 so much about par season in breeding and
00:44:14.720 how the community is dying like why is
00:44:17.599 that why is the community dying yeah
00:44:20.880 they just don't want to get married I
00:44:22.559 think they wisened up no no I think
00:44:26.160 sorry you're married I'm married two
00:44:28.160 kids how long have you been married 10
00:44:30.440 years Pary girl no no no part of the
00:44:35.520 problem I am part of the problem but uh
00:44:38.880 we got excommunicated from we have um uh
00:44:43.200 it is actually nothing to do with
00:44:44.640 religion but it's more cultural so I
00:44:47.280 think in the 8th century when the
00:44:50.880 first boatload of pares came in and they
00:44:53.839 landed near udwada in Gujarat
00:44:56.760 uh they made a promise to the king then
00:44:58.359 that they will never intermingle because
00:45:00.119 the king said hey we don't want you you
00:45:02.359 know intermingling with and there's a
00:45:04.319 very famous story about how they brought
00:45:06.599 a glass full of milk and he said do you
00:45:09.800 see any more space in this and uh the
00:45:13.839 Pary asked some sugar and he put that in
00:45:15.720 and said see we could there's still
00:45:18.040 space for sweet people in your uh
00:45:20.760 country and they and they made and yeah
00:45:23.520 so that is the legend always go with the
00:45:25.680 legend was this in the 8th Century 700
00:45:28.839 something yeah that was the first 1200
00:45:31.200 years ago yeah that's when the pares
00:45:32.960 came in the zor yeah and 100 years ago
00:45:36.319 that's when the iris came in the iRun so
00:45:39.000 all the Irani surnames are recent
00:45:41.559 immigrants and they're completely like
00:45:43.920 different from the pares who've been um
00:45:47.240 in India for a very long time Ed a lot
00:45:49.760 of the cultures but have also not
00:45:52.920 mingled uh the way other cultures have
00:45:56.359 right because again so if you marry
00:45:58.960 outside your religion you're
00:46:00.839 excommunicated immediately your children
00:46:03.400 do not become so and that is again from
00:46:05.960 your maternal side from paternal side
00:46:08.680 the wife doesn't become zation but your
00:46:11.119 children can
00:46:12.359 become so
00:46:14.480 um counterintuitive to other religions
00:46:17.240 which want to propagate I think that
00:46:19.000 this is again I think it's it's become
00:46:20.760 more of a cultural thing and I think
00:46:22.280 that um you know true uh Pary style they
00:46:26.680 do keep their word so I think you know
00:46:29.319 almost Thousand Years Later they're
00:46:30.720 still keeping the word but a very
00:46:31.960 wealthy community an altruistic
00:46:34.520 Community yes uh don't ask where they
00:46:36.240 got the wealth I'm sure there's enough
00:46:37.640 literature out there um altruistic how
00:46:40.599 they donate they give away Al a guess in
00:46:42.920 a sense that you know there's a very
00:46:44.280 famous saying that you never see a Pary
00:46:47.839 beggar or even a seik Begg uh because
00:46:51.319 the like the siks uh the community
00:46:53.760 really reaches out and you know offers a
00:46:56.280 helping hand and there's lots of um
00:46:59.440 charitable initiatives done by uh you
00:47:02.040 know the big Pary business homes they
00:47:04.480 make sure that they provide great good
00:47:07.319 quality housing they they they reach out
00:47:09.640 and help and make sure that they they
00:47:12.319 are above poverty levels at all points
00:47:14.920 of time they take care of their own they
00:47:16.760 do take care of their own they do take
00:47:18.000 care of a lot of other people as well
00:47:19.920 you you've seen no I mean we like to
00:47:22.200 claim the parses we love them we proud
00:47:24.960 of them we say you know where they were
00:47:27.000 born 50 they originally I think about
00:47:30.160 I've heard under 50,000 yeah something
00:47:32.040 like that and today
00:47:34.520 and oh wow the the the one the non EXC
00:47:38.040 communicado ones even my people say is
00:47:41.280 going down we're conies something called
00:47:43.640 gsbs we all need to sit together and
00:47:45.920 work out strategies there is an element
00:47:47.800 of self-deprecation in every fire lines
00:47:49.920 that you say it's kind of cool is it
00:47:52.839 yeah it gives you edge I think I'm going
00:47:54.720 to increase it to seven
00:47:57.200 yeah so you were a DJ at Pary weddings
00:48:01.319 at Pary weddings Catholic weddings we
00:48:03.160 grew I grew up in in a place called Bala
00:48:05.880 in Bombay uh where we were surrounded by
00:48:09.480 um a large part was a Catholic community
00:48:12.200 and some of it was because of my uh you
00:48:15.880 know I my mother's side I I actually I
00:48:20.000 more grew up more as a Pary than than
00:48:22.079 are you religious Fe not at all right
00:48:24.280 are you s yes I am Puja spiritual okay
00:48:29.920 zero okay so you were a DJ and this was
00:48:32.359 like a part-time gay college yeah yeah
00:48:34.880 enjoy you know it's to like show up with
00:48:37.079 cassettes like a bag full of cassettes
00:48:40.160 all rebound and kept to the song that
00:48:42.960 you want because you know you there was
00:48:45.480 no CDs at that point of time it was all
00:48:48.359 and you had to have mix tapes and you go
00:48:51.079 with one tape recorder and another tape
00:48:52.839 recorder and you to press play did you
00:48:55.200 use the and it no no I could afford LPS
00:48:58.799 cassettes was I could like pirate them
00:49:00.359 and play whatever I wanted we used to
00:49:02.280 play Cliff Richards and um shaking
00:49:06.119 Stevens and Chubby Checker
00:49:09.400 and it was RI seems like the original
00:49:12.240 cool guy right like he must have been
00:49:14.400 the popular guy in college no how many
00:49:17.200 girlfriends did you have in
00:49:18.280 [Music]
00:49:19.799 colge I guess my fres share and a couple
00:49:23.880 of other people's FES to
00:49:26.960 at Le he open about
00:49:28.640 it and your father had a restaurant as
00:49:31.280 well yes he did betes at church berries
00:49:34.359 where it all started fromy food no uh in
00:49:39.440 my berries was a restaurant started by a
00:49:41.920 gentleman called Mr Berry and that's how
00:49:44.280 it gets his name it's actually berries
00:49:46.760 okay but uh it became berries Berry or b
00:49:50.880 b e r yeah B yeah a so you grew up in
00:49:54.599 Bombay went to school scho I went to
00:49:56.960 school uh we talking about the
00:49:58.799 restaurant now or no no child going back
00:50:01.760 child this is like a movie right Ling
00:50:03.680 this it gives you so much insight into
00:50:05.640 the person so
00:50:07.000 quickly um yeah I think
00:50:10.480 um we came um there was a little bit of
00:50:14.280 you know Financial strain I was very
00:50:16.680 keen on earning my own money uh at had a
00:50:19.599 very early age so my father's side comes
00:50:22.359 from a community which are called the
00:50:24.440 koas or the aak khanis or the Isis or
00:50:28.400 the prince aak Khan the followers of
00:50:30.040 that so it's a certain sect amongst the
00:50:32.200 sect um we as koas we have maintained a
00:50:37.760 lot of our previous practices right and
00:50:41.359 and I think that that's beautiful so um
00:50:44.280 we have my father was a saaba Mand again
00:50:48.440 you know there's not something that most
00:50:50.440 Muslims do um we used to go to Shi
00:50:53.200 pretty often every holy on hia we used
00:50:56.280 to have a fire um that we used to burn
00:51:00.520 uh during Diwali we used to do choa
00:51:02.440 pujan which is um you know you come down
00:51:06.079 and you kind of write uh in a very K by
00:51:09.400 the way that's very interesting the the
00:51:11.119 what you wrote on the book was all about
00:51:13.400 you we spoke about aakhan and we spoke
00:51:15.760 about KU jino bandar and we spoke about
00:51:18.440 Lakshmi and so it was this kind of a
00:51:20.920 hybrid kind of a religion which which I
00:51:24.240 guess um it many ways reflects what
00:51:27.280 India is all about right I mean uh it's
00:51:30.559 it's to to have a knowledge and to have
00:51:34.119 an appreciation for uh such a diverse uh
00:51:39.680 and spiritually diverse nation that we
00:51:41.520 are I think U quite blessed to have that
00:51:44.640 uh upbringing a lot of your restaurants
00:51:47.839 I've been to I've been to mocha there's
00:51:50.079 a smoke house right down the road which
00:51:52.319 makes uh a great grilled chicken
00:51:56.640 and uh they have some fish what is it
00:51:59.200 called that memorable one it's good good
00:52:02.720 social is good slink and B is good boss
00:52:05.920 Burger I haven't tried prit Cafe tell us
00:52:08.160 a bit about that so prit Cafe is
00:52:11.119 actually a very very special place um
00:52:14.000 it's part of uh PRI theater and um it
00:52:18.240 was set up uh by Shashi Kapur in uh the
00:52:22.559 actor the actor in memory of his his uh
00:52:25.960 father PR Raj Kapoor that's why it's
00:52:28.960 called PR theater uh and now run by his
00:52:33.319 children konal Kapoor and sanjana Kapoor
00:52:37.520 um who literally are keeping you know
00:52:40.960 the flag flying
00:52:44.440 for the the the drama and the you know
00:52:47.920 the plays and that kind of cultural
00:52:49.640 fabric I think PR is a very important
00:52:52.359 part of uh cultural fabric of Mumbai at
00:52:54.920 least M and um I think PR Cafe was first
00:52:59.119 started by adman prad kaker and and made
00:53:03.319 it very famous and it was this made a
00:53:04.760 very famous restaurant yeah the name is
00:53:07.880 really cool Papa
00:53:09.760 Pancho he had one more before that I
00:53:11.839 think he was running the tea although
00:53:12.960 it's in the news for all the wrong
00:53:13.880 reasons yeah shut down because of a rat
00:53:16.559 or something he got shut down because he
00:53:18.680 was being hustled but come to that
00:53:23.319 later um
00:53:25.880 yeah so it was this place where uh
00:53:29.960 uh nasin sha you can see him on the o
00:53:34.200 day om
00:53:35.359 Puri uh makr Pand sitting with a pack of
00:53:39.559 Four Square reading scripts screaming
00:53:41.440 and shouting emoting you know and uh
00:53:44.920 every now and then a flst would come in
00:53:46.799 with a flute and just start playing in a
00:53:48.520 corner and a player would come and just
00:53:52.200 you know do their what kind of theater
00:53:53.760 is it is it like the typical it's a it's
00:53:56.040 a it's a small little heartfelt little
00:53:58.559 space I don't think it seats more than
00:54:00.119 300 people right um best gold coffee he
00:54:03.119 Bollywood a big part of your lives in
00:54:05.880 Bombay mine yes yours as well cuz he was
00:54:09.400 just mentioning some actors and
00:54:11.400 musicians oh
00:54:13.119 no I see like a pattern in music in you
00:54:16.200 which I'm going to get to like going
00:54:17.680 from DJ to studying entertainment
00:54:20.119 Management in
00:54:21.640 UCLA to still your bars still kind of
00:54:26.640 like revolve around the music that is
00:54:29.000 played there right I don't think it's
00:54:30.799 about the music I mean I love music that
00:54:33.400 you know everybody does who doesn't love
00:54:35.839 music right it's like saying everybody
00:54:38.280 loves food everybody loves music
00:54:39.799 everybody likes to have a good time um
00:54:42.880 some people don't huh music not as much
00:54:45.839 yeah I love music so do I but I know
00:54:48.160 people who verying levels of bad people
00:54:50.760 love for music you don't want to hang
00:54:51.799 out with them right yeah are they in
00:54:54.280 your 10 no
00:54:56.799 good huh so what's the connection with
00:54:59.480 music nothing I wouldn't say nothing um
00:55:02.720 you know I think that um restaurants are
00:55:05.079 a multi- sensory experience
00:55:07.559 right and
00:55:10.040 uh many times you know the takeoff point
00:55:13.079 for a restaurant could be music so I
00:55:15.920 would go to my Architects you know I and
00:55:18.960 I would say
00:55:20.960 okay this is like you know Acid Jazz
00:55:24.640 what kind of place would you want to
00:55:26.079 listen to acidizing and that would for
00:55:28.400 me would work as a really good kind of
00:55:30.440 entry point into the tonality of the
00:55:32.680 restaurant it doesn't really matter it's
00:55:34.720 just that the the the the tone as Z very
00:55:38.720 famously always says that you feel like
00:55:40.839 a conductor and he's like you know
00:55:42.520 making sure that all the various
00:55:44.640 Elements which it could be food it could
00:55:47.319 be the plates it could be the weight of
00:55:48.760 the glass in your hand it could be uh
00:55:52.599 the sights smells sounds all this goes
00:55:56.319 to complete the experience that you have
00:55:59.400 in if you had to pick one thing that
00:56:01.520 works for slink and B is it am I
00:56:04.400 pronouncing it right yes absolutely is
00:56:07.119 it music location food
00:56:11.799 Bombay okay I think now that we're done
00:56:13.880 with the intros we'll get into beginning
00:56:16.799 our podcast the food we can eat and talk
00:56:19.720 okay like this very casual food is good
00:56:22.359 huh yummy and the code of it all
00:56:25.880 restaurants are also like a real estate
00:56:27.599 space right that's what McDonald's
00:56:29.599 always claimed to be how much you can
00:56:31.240 monetize which area so if you can
00:56:32.960 tomorrow start monetizing Walls by
00:56:35.880 displaying brands or selling stuff would
00:56:38.359 you do put art would you do it of course
00:56:41.520 would love to do that why aren't you
00:56:42.680 doing it already we are doing in some
00:56:44.640 cases for example in some of our bars
00:56:48.920 some key locations for Logos are kept
00:56:51.760 for some beverage companies so a
00:56:53.720 Budweiser we have a link with Budweiser
00:56:56.200 we put their logos up they pay us money
00:56:57.680 for it I don't put cigarettes but their
00:57:00.160 ITC cigarette company would take a space
00:57:03.680 on your bar you can't sell it as far as
00:57:06.160 I know but you can put it over there and
00:57:07.520 they'll pay you like a decent amount of
00:57:08.680 money so you can and then of course
00:57:11.200 there are some restaurants where you can
00:57:13.240 actually buy the Crockery and the
00:57:14.680 cutlery as well and art art is lying on
00:57:18.039 the walls London Arts Club does I've
00:57:19.880 seen that in some places London Arts

00:57:58.960 where it's level 10 we got a few
00:58:01.720 options there
00:58:03.000 too just to trick everybody sorry one
00:58:06.720 sec Talk Amongst yourself giving us the
00:58:09.839 taste of our own
00:58:11.720 medicine we want to create a template of
00:58:14.960 how to start a restaurant and the
00:58:16.960 intricacies of it before that we'll
00:58:18.920 answer a bunch of questions about the
00:58:20.520 industry Trends what is growing what is
00:58:23.520 not all of that yeah
00:58:25.799 but just to come back to the question
00:58:27.319 you had asked earlier right we are in
00:58:28.799 the real estate
00:58:30.039 space sometimes people come to us for
00:58:33.000 real estate for the price of a cup of
00:58:34.880 coffee right but if you see where media
00:58:38.760 is going right you're scrolling and you
00:58:42.119 have exactly one second to capture
00:58:44.880 somebody's attention to be a thumb
00:58:46.520 stopper right and
00:58:49.079 um uh Holdings you just you know out of
00:58:53.160 home hings you wiing by you either e see
00:58:55.039 it or you don't see it in a restaurant
00:58:57.599 you're sitting for about an hour and a
00:58:59.039 half you have undivided attention there
00:59:02.000 is a place where actual behavior
00:59:04.400 modification can happen right uh you you
00:59:08.280 can you can really you know in a more
00:59:10.960 sensitive way introduce products uh to
00:59:14.760 customers I don't see why like one day
00:59:17.400 why a restaurant can't be like what a
00:59:19.520 television channel is right I mean give
00:59:22.520 the food for free the advertising p
00:59:24.799 right people are doing it all over why
00:59:27.160 not right especially at some point of
00:59:29.400 time it could become a model we try a
00:59:32.839 little bit we're doing a little few
00:59:34.160 little experiments there are lots of
00:59:36.280 places I think that restaurants have the
00:59:38.680 capability to you know have certain
00:59:41.599 influence over your behavior or you know
00:59:43.720 influence you in certain way and uh it
00:59:46.920 doesn't necessarily have to be on the
00:59:48.240 walls it doesn't necessarily have to be
00:59:50.119 Commerce but there various ways that you
00:59:52.559 can have an impact uh and and actually
00:59:55.200 work with other brands which which is
00:59:57.839 quite cool especially when you're you
00:59:59.319 know in the business of
01:00:01.039 culture imagine if you're charging for
01:00:03.079 the Wi-Fi but the food is free it's like
01:00:06.039 a one of those bars Tapas bars in
01:00:09.160 chupito bars style bars in in Spain
01:00:12.079 where you can go and there are tons of
01:00:13.680 them shots and liquor oriented you pay
01:00:17.200 for the drinks and the food is given for
01:00:18.920 free m you could give for example a tech
01:00:22.079 company could figure out to sell a
01:00:23.280 service for free and give free coffee
01:00:25.160 and free food is that the way forward
01:00:27.480 you think for restaurants like I see in
01:00:29.640 Dubai restaurants fly one way one way
01:00:32.480 that's a I think socials is becoming a
01:00:35.559 workplace during the day right
01:00:36.760 co-working social always been a
01:00:38.240 co-working space but do you think
01:00:39.680 because you're using so much real estate
01:00:41.920 inventory only at a certain time of the
01:00:44.559 day The Logical Way Forward would be to
01:00:47.160 monetize the other times for different
01:00:49.000 things yeah so I think the you're paying
01:00:51.880 rent for 24 hours right yeah but you
01:00:54.160 using it for basically 12 to 14 at Max
01:00:58.039 you're paying salaries for the month
01:01:01.720 you're able to utilize uh at Max I think
01:01:04.319 8 hours a day I think um restaurants are
01:01:08.200 the final Bastion of Hope for human
01:01:10.559 offline social engagement that's too
01:01:12.520 much responsibility and it is it is the
01:01:15.520 final Bastion of Hope because I really
01:01:17.920 think the digital world is overcoming
01:01:20.799 everything else and so I think the
01:01:22.400 restaurants play a key role in binding
01:01:25.480 families it's a huge responsibility as R
01:01:27.960 said but I think it is also we're in the
01:01:30.559 business of giving happiness it's a huge
01:01:33.319 responsibility because people are coming
01:01:34.960 to you to celebrate life's greatest
01:01:37.240 moments to you know Centenary you know a
01:01:41.599 marriage proposal you know your break up
01:01:44.640 date yeah break up a date night with
01:01:47.240 your first love so I think I really
01:01:49.640 think and I really hope and I don't have
01:01:51.079 a dis openen view of the of the future
01:01:52.720 of restaurants I have a very positive
01:01:54.000 View
01:01:55.119 uh and once we get into the math of what
01:01:57.079 India can offer you'll realize that we
01:01:59.480 have not even scratched the surface yet
01:02:01.319 for restauran thing or delivery in India
01:02:03.079 yet so you know I have a thesis for
01:02:06.400 businesses which are a place of passion
01:02:09.160 like restaurant or Bollywood or like
01:02:12.039 things that you consider a passion can
01:02:13.839 which can also be a
01:02:15.559 profession the odds of success while we
01:02:18.400 trying to make this entire show for
01:02:20.400 somebody who wants to start a restaurant
01:02:23.079 to help them have all the details at
01:02:25.319 hand and help them increase the odds of
01:02:28.279 success whenever you attempting a
01:02:31.359 vocation of
01:02:32.799 passion more often than not the odds are
01:02:35.559 stacked against you because there are
01:02:37.520 many other people who are attempting it
01:02:39.400 not with a monetary gain in mind because
01:02:42.599 it is cool to have a restaurant uh a lot
01:02:45.559 of people want to retire to a bar on the
01:02:47.440 beach I know so many of my
01:02:49.599 friends who knew nothing about
01:02:51.680 restaurants but attempted it because it
01:02:53.680 was some child passion or dream of
01:02:55.720 theirs so this is something to really
01:02:58.799 bear in mind so the first thing I think
01:03:02.160 we should really arrive at is across the
01:03:05.680 board odds of a restaurant being
01:03:08.279 successful what do you think is an
01:03:09.599 accurate number 10% 20% knows this but
01:03:13.880 and so is the highest morbidity rate
01:03:16.920 business in the world 90% around that of
01:03:21.640 restaurants failed within the first year
01:03:23.359 and around 96% within 18 months and the
01:03:25.359 biggest reason you won't believe is not
01:03:27.559 necessarily lack of passion or getting
01:03:29.680 into it for glamorous glamorous reasons
01:03:32.160 it's under capitalization people have
01:03:34.599 money to build a restaurant but they
01:03:37.039 don't plan for the
01:03:38.720 gestation right and the gestation is
01:03:42.160 what can kill you it can demotivate you
01:03:43.799 it can make the quality become bad
01:03:46.960 because you don't have money to pay the
01:03:49.119 bills so you start compromising and
01:03:51.520 unfortunately that's just the nature I
01:03:54.119 think I think this is a Passion Play
01:03:55.680 restaurants in general it's not a 9 to5
01:03:58.279 it's a lifestyle choice you have to get
01:03:59.799 into it for the right reasons it cannot
01:04:01.839 be an extension of your drawing room if
01:04:04.440 that's what you're trying to do invest
01:04:06.680 half the amount of money and make your
01:04:07.880 drawing room
01:04:09.559 better you know I think U yeah a lot of
01:04:13.119 people get in because and I used this we
01:04:15.920 were talking about ball bearings earlier
01:04:17.760 and a lot of the people who do get into
01:04:20.279 the restaurant industry like made
01:04:22.680 billions selling ball bildings but
01:04:24.720 nobody knows who you are you know you
01:04:27.520 open up a restaurant glamour no it's not
01:04:30.119 it's not just glamour so for some it's
01:04:31.839 glamour for some it's calling card for
01:04:34.279 some it is a networking opportunity
01:04:37.480 right for some it is a childhood cherish
01:04:39.319 dream for for some it is a leg up in
01:04:42.240 society and for some it is genuine
01:04:43.799 passion right it's genuine there are
01:04:46.440 various reasons why people do get into
01:04:48.640 the
01:04:53.160 restaur
01:05:00.880 so if the bo
01:05:04.720 doing but what we agreeing on broadly is
01:05:07.599 the odds of success for a restaurant
01:05:10.720 2-year Runway is something like 3
01:05:13.480 4% two years 4% you could say there are
01:05:17.799 obviously you know outliers but in
01:05:20.720 general you would say under 10% would be
01:05:23.359 the number where you would not have
01:05:25.520 success so unless bring a
01:05:28.520 specific USB that you can bring to the
01:05:31.920 table 90% you'll fail don't attempt it I
01:05:36.200 think there's a secret sauce and that
01:05:37.640 secret sauce is um the last thing that
01:05:40.720 Raz mentioned which is Passion if you're
01:05:43.000 passionate about it you'll figure it out
01:05:45.440 and if but wouldn't all 100 attempting
01:05:48.480 it think they're passionate in their own
01:05:50.039 I I don't think that higher percentage
01:05:52.200 get into it with passion no I think few
01:05:55.039 get into passion if you get into your
01:05:57.720 chance again I'm not saying that you're
01:05:58.760 going to 100% succeed your chances of
01:06:00.520 failure reduce drastically Define
01:06:02.359 passion from this
01:06:03.880 lens it's the only thing you can see
01:06:06.039 yourself doing it's something that you
01:06:08.599 would do for free and then figure out a
01:06:11.200 way to make money from it I think that's
01:06:12.520 passion janun
01:06:15.200 Madness uh something that doesn't let
01:06:17.200 you sleep at night an itch that needs to
01:06:19.400 be
01:06:20.400 scratched but how long can passion also
01:06:22.880 keep you going right like I'll take my
01:06:24.839 example I started this when I was 23
01:06:27.039 extremely passionate but 14 years I've
01:06:29.039 had my ups and downs of this is hard
01:06:31.359 work this is you know this is like awful
01:06:34.520 this is great I love it I hate it so
01:06:37.039 it's
01:06:37.920 a it's never really like that also keeps
01:06:41.559 every every day I wake up in the morning
01:06:43.760 I'm like this is it why am I doing this
01:06:46.839 shut last 10 years and you know and
01:06:49.200 every day you walk into a restaurant you
01:06:50.720 see people having a great time and
01:06:52.000 you're like damn I love my job
01:06:54.640 it's a constantly conflicted conscience
01:06:59.000 I think eating out patterns in India uh
01:07:02.559 people in India eat out on average one
01:07:05.279 time a week they spend $3 people in the
01:07:08.720 US eat out on average four to five times
01:07:11.039 a week in China it's twice a week but in
01:07:14.119 China and us they spend a significantly
01:07:17.039 higher amount of money in China the
01:07:18.599 average meal is $10 in US is $20 India
01:07:21.799 is $3 why do you think is is it cultural
01:07:26.599 why do people go out as little is it
01:07:29.799 because you have a you can have a chef
01:07:32.079 at home we live in join families there
01:07:34.400 is always food at home stigma wasting
01:07:39.400 food
01:07:42.359 advance I think that look I think that
01:07:45.039 we are eating out and we're growing very
01:07:46.720 very quickly we were eating out four
01:07:49.160 times a month in uh I think in 200 14
01:07:54.720 when we did our first reports Z and I
01:07:57.480 think the
01:07:58.760 200 I think 19 report was the previous
01:08:01.599 just before the the no even later we had
01:08:04.599 come up to eight times a month and in
01:08:06.880 urban area we were up to about 16 times
01:08:09.200 a month but give an example Singapore
01:08:11.640 eats out 52 times a month yeah right so
01:08:14.920 I read that and I saw that the
01:08:16.198 valuations of CH in Singapore is
01:08:18.759 ridiculous they're billion dollar
01:08:20.279 restaurant companies but they're not
01:08:21.640 they still not Valu the same value that
01:08:23.880 companies in India Val yeah if you
01:08:25.960 increase the price of a dish in
01:08:28.198 Smokehouse Delhi from 400 Rupees to 600
01:08:31.839 rupees you Rebrand your menu that way
01:08:35.040 will people perceive you to be at a
01:08:37.120 higher price point hence higher quality
01:08:39.439 and you get more footfalls no let me let
01:08:41.279 me look at tell look India is a very
01:08:43.158 value conscious Market it's not a price
01:08:45.520 sensitive Market it's a value sensitive
01:08:47.319 Market why is premiumization works so
01:08:48.920 premiumization I'll tell you what
01:08:50.080 premium so we we saw in Delhi took some
01:08:52.799 you know Progressive steps they brought
01:08:55.439 the you know the excise duty down on
01:08:57.158 liquor right what we saw was that people
01:09:02.198 while so the prices of the liquor went
01:09:04.560 down in bars we reduced the prices
01:09:07.600 follow suit passed on the benefit to the
01:09:09.600 customers the customers didn't drink
01:09:11.880 more of their liquor they upgraded to
01:09:15.198 the next one you understand so where
01:09:17.600 they were drinking a red label they
01:09:20.359 didn't say okay now you know I was I
01:09:22.000 would typically have two glass two
01:09:24.279 uh red labels now I will have three they
01:09:27.238 said I will have black label because now
01:09:30.880 it that's the same amount of money that
01:09:32.319 I'm spending right so that's where I see
01:09:34.319 premiumization happening that people are
01:09:36.520 wanting to actually get into a better
01:09:39.319 quality product or what they perceive to
01:09:40.960 be a better quality product we're not
01:09:42.319 getting into the merits of uh the
01:09:45.000 product but yes that is where
01:09:46.560 premiumization is happening that people
01:09:48.399 want to be consuming better they want to
01:09:51.238 be consuming uh they want to go to
01:09:53.799 Brands they want to go to brands that
01:09:55.159 they trust and they go to Brands where
01:09:56.480 they feel that it'll enhance the image
01:09:59.199 Prestige you know or their their quality
01:10:01.920 of life what segment is if RI was a
01:10:04.920 young man 20 years old start what do you
01:10:07.080 mean
01:10:07.800 if younger man if you were starting off
01:10:11.320 at 20 what would you start one one
01:10:14.440 option you have one CR rupe budget what
01:10:16.960 would you start a
01:10:19.000 band but you denied The Music Connection
01:10:21.640 somehow I've been like coming back to
01:10:23.120 that right there's something in music
01:10:24.920 there okay but what kind of restaurant
01:10:27.320 what kind of restaurant would I start up
01:10:28.960 all over again
01:10:31.040 one highest ords of success not
01:10:34.600 passion uh social I would do that
01:10:37.880 because for me I feel that uh in this
01:10:41.760 country is the best product Market fit
01:10:44.840 the that we are seeing we are extremely
01:10:47.480 young uh audience we are an audience
01:10:51.239 which believes in the gig economy uh in
01:10:53.600 in the freelance economy people are
01:10:55.760 looking for places to work from uh they
01:10:58.560 are you know they're being social while
01:11:00.640 they work and they working while they're
01:11:02.600 being social the lines are blurring um
01:11:05.920 we are looking for spaces to hang out
01:11:09.080 where we can you know do some work meet
01:11:12.159 people we're looking for for one or
01:11:14.880 better word we're looking for accessible
01:11:17.280 vworks and we're looking for accessible
01:11:19.360 so houses um and I think that that's the
01:11:22.360 role that social really could set up one
01:11:24.679 in one CR uh no I I could set I could
01:11:28.640 put equity and uh the rest I would get
01:11:31.600 in credit is it easy to get credit when
01:11:34.199 you're starting a restaurant working
01:11:35.560 capital I don't think so um it's like I
01:11:37.880 said it's such a high failure rate
01:11:39.199 business that um to go to a bank and
01:11:42.159 expect them to give you you have a
01:11:44.520 better chance
01:11:46.719 at jumping off an aircraft and surviving
01:11:49.920 then being a first time restaurant tour
01:11:52.040 and going to a bank and asking for money
01:11:54.080 to open a new restaurant so you partner
01:11:57.120 with
01:11:58.320 somebody and then you partner with
01:12:00.639 somebody who has relevant experience and
01:12:02.440 then you're able to rise I think like I
01:12:04.920 said I think initially it's always
01:12:06.840 better to be a little careful and
01:12:09.400 Frugal um don't go ahead and try and
01:12:12.239 open a 5,000 ft 200 C restaurant maybe
01:12:15.239 start out today with a cloud kitchen or
01:12:17.679 a small Cafe why you wasting the cloud
01:12:20.400 kitchen you don't have to I love I love
01:12:22.760 Cloud kitchen because you're using your
01:12:24.199 existing infrastructure no I'm not
01:12:26.120 actually I have nobody making money
01:12:28.199 business well actually I beg to differ
01:12:29.480 on that but we actually talk about Cloud
01:12:32.440 kitchen Cloud kit yeah so we don't use
01:12:34.639 any of our existing infrastructure at
01:12:36.120 all uh not even one restaurant not even
01:12:38.960 a single
01:12:41.560 restaurant so yeah so exactly so you'll
01:12:43.960 be surprised that we actually don't use
01:12:45.600 it on purpose because at some point in
01:12:47.120 time we might segregate the two
01:12:48.960 businesses and as a result we cannot
01:12:50.719 have that blurring of lines so we do not
01:12:53.199 use ex infrastructure separate Cloud
01:12:56.040 kitchens absolutely separate Cloud
01:12:58.000 kitchens I see Domino's Pizza really
01:13:00.480 working I see Italian food starting to
01:13:02.800 work in India like it worked for
01:13:05.120 garments when we sold Western garment
01:13:07.760 with Western models like it did for
01:13:09.840 Paige and a bunch of different companies
01:13:12.960 selling a foreign product in India like
01:13:15.120 a burger is working I think there's a is
01:13:19.320 it growing faster than a Biryani for
01:13:20.960 example no so it's never going the
01:13:22.239 consumption patterns are never going to
01:13:23.600 be there but you have to understand that
01:13:24.719 the competition and the number of
01:13:26.960 players in that category are far more in
01:13:30.520 Biryani as opposed to Burger so if you
01:13:32.440 were to open a Biryani brand say in
01:13:34.719 Southern India Bangalore you have great
01:13:37.080 local players that are these
01:13:38.560 institutions and it transitions well to
01:13:40.560 tier 2 tier three it transitions well
01:13:42.639 you might have to tweak the pricing
01:13:44.080 don't think you can sell a 800 rupee
01:13:46.239 Burger in uh are there 800 rupee burgers
01:13:49.120 in Louis Burger there's one there's one
01:13:51.560 it's 3% 4% of our sale so doesn't sell
01:13:53.800 much but it's there the cost of good
01:13:56.199 typically on a burger like cost of
01:13:57.840 producing the burger so we're running at
01:14:00.080 around about 30 to 31% I would say is
01:14:03.440 that fair for all kind of food you
01:14:04.840 should run it about 30% the the rule of
01:14:07.880 thumb says 30% but you can be lower
01:14:10.199 Chinese food I've seen you can come up
01:14:12.520 with slightly lower Indian food simply
01:14:14.679 because the quantity of chicken and the
01:14:16.000 muscle protein that you have to use
01:14:17.840 typically higher in in price and then of
01:14:20.280 course Italian food would be higher as
01:14:21.960 well because the cheeses you have to
01:14:23.360 Port perhaps uh but you're getting great
01:14:26.360 Alternatives every alternative is
01:14:28.239 available in India so Louis Burger boss
01:14:30.199 Burger competition in a sense yes same
01:14:33.120 markets yeah Sim similar Market same
01:14:35.280 price point no I think Lou is higher Lou
01:14:37.880 higher would good flipin also be a part
01:14:39.960 of this yeah good flipping and uh and
01:14:42.880 exact no I think good flipping it would
01:14:44.639 be more uh on the boss Burger price
01:14:48.800 slightly lower slightly lower also I
01:14:50.800 think it's higher if I were to build a
01:14:52.080 burger brand there is Louie there is
01:14:54.360 boss there something called Burger sing
01:14:55.800 as well right yeah yeah it's very
01:14:57.360 indianized Burgers IND pretty well H all
01:14:59.960 of this how do I create a burger
01:15:02.199 brand well you have to figure out the
01:15:04.679 bun figure out the bun is that the key
01:15:07.440 protein not the sace not the protein Al
01:15:10.040 it's a some of its parts you cannot
01:15:11.679 obviously I'm making a simplist
01:15:13.880 simplistic joke out of it you got to get
01:15:16.000 the basics right I think um the again
01:15:19.000 I'm getting into details the meat to bun
01:15:21.480 Ratio or the vegetable Patty to bun
01:15:23.000 ratio which was incredibly important if
01:15:24.800 you have a little little dice or a
01:15:26.520 little you know cutlet size Patty in the
01:15:29.239 middle and the bun is falling all over
01:15:31.360 people are not going to see value
01:15:32.480 Indians
01:15:33.679 are
01:15:35.320 small so I think a burger brand I think
01:15:37.800 he meant something else but I know I
01:15:40.400 know no no no talk Burger sizes are very
01:15:42.920 important right bu sies are important
01:15:46.639 important okay when you get so typically
01:15:48.560 a McDonald's burger would be much
01:15:50.239 smaller Burger it won't be filling much
01:15:53.560 smaller Burger than what you would get
01:15:55.080 at a boss burger or at a Louis Burg so
01:15:58.040 Louis Burger is on its way we should try
01:15:59.480 it and so the thing is that you could
01:16:00.840 actually spend so if a McDonald's burger
01:16:03.480 cost 120 bucks you'll actually need two
01:16:05.840 to feel full whereas at at 250 bucks a
01:16:09.280 Louis burger cheeseburger would be more
01:16:11.880 filling comparatively and how do you
01:16:14.960 decide where to open a burger joint or
01:16:17.199 where to open a pser for example is
01:16:19.280 there a like I'm I come from a different
01:16:22.360 world right like is there a API of
01:16:24.920 restaurants together where you can
01:16:26.800 gather data of what is the demographic
01:16:29.159 what kind of client is buying how much
01:16:31.360 are they spending is this data available
01:16:33.679 this data is available with a lot of
01:16:35.560 real cons real estate consultant and
01:16:37.520 they charge you money for there are
01:16:38.600 there are enough uh companies now uh
01:16:41.639 which are uh have very detailed
01:16:44.800 demographic uh breakups on each can you
01:16:47.600 give us some examples just I will I will
01:16:49.480 send you a link I don't know I'll tell
01:16:51.480 you J J
01:16:53.639 us more more focused I don't even think
01:16:57.239 that data is really that up to dat or
01:16:59.440 accurate I think it's been ex
01:17:01.960 extrapolated from a you know finite base
01:17:05.120 of information I would not like take a
01:17:08.239 business decision based purely on a
01:17:09.880 document given to me by a gll I would go
01:17:12.639 with in a almost in a you know
01:17:15.040 oldfashioned way I would go with my gut
01:17:16.360 instinct for a physical space with the
01:17:18.360 cloud kitchen obviously it's it's
01:17:20.320 geography is history right with the
01:17:21.920 cloud kitchen geography is history
01:17:23.120 you're virtual so you don't really need
01:17:24.880 to care about where you are you need to
01:17:26.400 be in general area so if you know this
01:17:29.120 area CBD has a large demand of burgers
01:17:32.480 you'd open somewhere but you don't need
01:17:33.639 to be on Church Street you could be in
01:17:34.880 one but how do you know CBD has a large
01:17:36.719 demand of burgers cuz zamato and swi
01:17:38.679 zabad do they share data yes of demand
01:17:41.920 yes so they will they will help you they
01:17:44.080 will they will tell you where if if they
01:17:46.520 feel that there's a particular demand in
01:17:48.360 a particular region which is underserved
01:17:51.000 by that particular kind of Cuisine that
01:17:53.159 they will kind of come in and they will
01:17:55.199 inform you I also know of like a a new
01:17:57.639 coffee chain that's trying to expand and
01:18:00.080 grow and their mandate for Real Estate
01:18:02.639 is just open next to a Starbucks
01:18:04.080 Starbucks are you talking about blue
01:18:07.000 toai third I'm an inves no actually what
01:18:10.280 is what is interesting is is I
01:18:13.040 personally feel that you know we tend to
01:18:15.320 run and we tend to go after the same
01:18:16.960 locations and everybody wants to go
01:18:18.560 there it is the locations which are
01:18:20.360 unders served which has the aspiration
01:18:22.760 which has the spending power are the
01:18:25.280 ones which will actually landine up
01:18:26.400 doing much better for you because get
01:18:27.600 them at better rentals yeah uh you get a
01:18:31.280 a way more you know your pipeline is
01:18:33.480 much bigger because those those people
01:18:35.400 are really really underst there's so
01:18:37.120 many areas in in in everywhere which are
01:18:40.280 completely un but you know typical you
01:18:43.280 know Market intelligence will tell you
01:18:44.840 okay these other areas of go I think
01:18:46.480 that if you kind of use uh the
01:18:49.360 demographic data that is available right
01:18:51.920 you know you've done done you know what
01:18:53.800 your customer looks like you know areas
01:18:56.840 where they are and they are in abundance
01:18:58.760 and there are no other restaurants to
01:19:00.080 service them those are really really
01:19:02.080 good areas to go and set up sh so if I
01:19:03.920 don't have the means to afford this data
01:19:07.440 through gll or KPMG or real estate guys
01:19:10.679 can I go sit in the competition and
01:19:12.719 write down how many people are coming
01:19:14.639 absolutely to do it that is actually the
01:19:17.320 best way to do it in fact um markets
01:19:20.800 change their dynamic in nature so a
01:19:23.040 great market across the street could
01:19:24.360 soon become irrelevant because you know
01:19:26.719 a highway is being constructed across
01:19:28.000 the street or another cooler mall is
01:19:29.920 coming up this happened to me many times
01:19:31.480 where I've been part of a Resturant do
01:19:34.159 malls work malls are doing fairly well
01:19:36.400 but you know here's the point I've done
01:19:38.199 a lot of research on this malls are good
01:19:42.000 for incidental footfall but cost
01:19:45.360 prohibitive and your margins in a stand
01:19:48.000 loone restaurant with lower incidental
01:19:50.560 footfall your margins are going to be
01:19:52.400 better than in a mall a mall has a lot
01:19:53.920 of hidden things marketing cost parking
01:19:56.440 cost cam the common area maintenance
01:19:59.199 obviously the rent and the rent is on
01:20:00.520 super area so if you have 500 square ft
01:20:02.719 depending on efficiency you could be
01:20:04.120 paying for as much as for 1,000 square
01:20:06.440 fet although you're occupying 500 foot
01:20:08.800 carpet so it is good from a brand
01:20:11.840 building perspective and it can make
01:20:13.199 money but your Abida margins which is
01:20:15.040 the real margin that you look at would
01:20:16.920 perhaps be better served not always but
01:20:19.400 in many cases in Stand loan sites in and
01:20:22.920 even better here's the beauty of India
01:20:24.760 in tier 2 and tier three cities fzy Cafe
01:20:27.480 is now in about 15 cities of India and
01:20:30.040 we're actually seeing some of our best
01:20:31.600 performing stores to be coming out of
01:20:33.040 tier 2 and tier three they're beating
01:20:35.000 Bombay and de Bangalore is the best
01:20:36.960 example but it's obviously a Metro tier
01:20:38.639 one city but why does every brand every
01:20:42.760 new brand especially MNC open its first
01:20:45.360 store in Bangalore reasons are simple it
01:20:48.159 has got Metro
01:20:50.280 level purchasing power and and a super
01:20:53.320 sophisticated clientele with people from
01:20:55.560 all over the country that are living in
01:20:56.960 Bangalore they don't go home and cook
01:20:59.120 they don't even have gas connections
01:21:00.320 most probably they go out and enjoy do
01:21:01.880 you have data around how much people eat
01:21:03.600 out
01:21:04.960 city-wise yeah it is there at a fairly
01:21:07.639 granular level so if it's across the
01:21:10.400 nation four times a month or one time
01:21:12.679 eight times a month no eight times a tce
01:21:14.679 a week inur uh cities in urban India 16
01:21:17.280 times so if the real C is 16 if the real
01:21:19.639 estate cost of the city is higher and
01:21:22.040 they have smaller homes they go out to
01:21:23.600 eat more so I'm guessing Bombay will be
01:21:25.199 the highest not necessarily actually
01:21:27.360 it's not no Bombay has High Cost of
01:21:31.520 Living and it's I mean it's there's
01:21:35.239 still a whole bunch of you know
01:21:36.400 different demographics involved for us
01:21:38.600 in our system Bombay is not the number
01:21:40.639 one city for uh Revenue per square foot
01:21:43.080 so the rail metric you should look at is
01:21:44.840 revenue per square foot so if you got a
01:21:46.199 10,000 square foot restaurant you're
01:21:47.440 doing a CR a month is different from
01:21:49.639 doing 80 lakhs from a 5,000 foot right
01:21:51.800 there's more efficiency in the smaller
01:21:53.080 one so from that perspective I think for
01:21:55.840 us Revenue per square foot is coming
01:21:57.320 highest in other cities not even Delhi
01:21:59.760 Bombay Bangalore Hyderabad
01:22:02.040 Kolkata and um it just shows the depth
01:22:05.560 that this country has I mean just look
01:22:07.480 at the numbers one in three people today
01:22:10.800 is either middle class or wealthier
01:22:13.040 today by 2030 that number is going to
01:22:15.840 become 1 in two a country with 1.5
01:22:19.000 billion means 750 million people will be
01:22:21.800 middle class and able to afford the
01:22:23.560 products that we're selling when does
01:22:24.679 that change let's say when is that ship
01:22:26.520 going to come home yeah when is that
01:22:28.719 when is that ship go to dog
01:22:30.960 2030 they 2010 that was 2022 they say
01:22:36.000 density of restaurants in India is about
01:22:39.280 10% of China and 2% of us exactly 10%
01:22:43.440 yeah exactly 10% you look at any chain
01:22:46.920 which is here the numbers you take that
01:22:48.679 multiply that by 10 or 11 that many
01:22:51.080 restaurants are there in China China
01:22:53.199 consumption changed and real estate
01:22:55.440 prices in China are far more affordable
01:22:57.520 spending power parity is higher so we
01:22:59.679 have our challenges real estate prices
01:23:01.600 in India are ridiculous right the entire
01:23:04.719 I don't understand the market where
01:23:06.719 percent percentage are so high yields
01:23:08.800 are so low but I would assume the rental
01:23:10.639 market is not so bad no terrible so I'll
01:23:13.400 give you an example I have a Resturant
01:23:14.679 4% commercial no no% commercial so the
01:23:18.800 the deal that they sign office pieces 6%
01:23:22.760 yield you're talking about you're
01:23:23.679 talking about the yield to the owner
01:23:24.960 yeah yeah 4 even 4% 4% residential would
01:23:27.800 be 3% before tax but that's because the
01:23:29.760 price is so high and your your your
01:23:31.719 interest component is 8% so how is that
01:23:35.440 how is that making any sense rent don't
01:23:37.520 buy right real estate rent for
01:23:40.040 commercial activities such as
01:23:41.159 restaurants is out of whack there is a
01:23:43.840 market called Galleria in guro where I
01:23:46.679 live that restaurants per square foot
01:23:49.360 cost a restaurant if you take 500 square
01:23:51.600 foot is more then canot Place more than
01:23:55.440 bandra more than Kaba more than KH
01:23:58.679 Market KH Market was the most expensive
01:24:00.239 and it's in GGO there are restaurants
01:24:02.960 that have signed within India that have
01:24:05.600 lower sorry that have a higher rent per
01:24:08.040 square foot than my restaurant in the US
01:24:10.280 or Canada or in traff traff girl Square
01:24:13.719 in England can you imagine a restaurant
01:24:15.960 in Deli or Bombay that has cost you more
01:24:19.440 per square foot than London whereas but
01:24:22.920 are you paying that rent because it's
01:24:24.360 worth it and you're getting that much
01:24:25.440 food fall cuz I'm guessing it's a supply
01:24:27.679 demand market right if nobody can make
01:24:29.520 money out of that much real estate
01:24:31.440 people would not be paying that much
01:24:32.800 yeah so firstly let me be very clear
01:24:34.320 margins in overseas restaurants are
01:24:37.560 either equal or a bit higher we had a
01:24:40.119 session recently at one of the Summits
01:24:42.239 where it was me and two other
01:24:44.040 restaurants who had restaurants overseas
01:24:45.880 and all of them came to the conclusion
01:24:47.520 that margins overseas are can be either
01:24:50.639 equal or higher and the main C
01:24:53.080 is real estate occupancy cost and the
01:24:55.239 lease they they're signing leases for
01:24:56.800 six six years they're making you invest
01:24:58.639 up to a million dollars in a restaurant
01:25:01.000 and the and the thing will only last for
01:25:02.719 six years there's no logic whereas
01:25:04.199 overseas it's 15 to 20 years right and
01:25:07.639 the so I'll give you my use case okay so
01:25:10.920 I had a thesis around restaurants and I
01:25:14.760 started investing in a bunch of them
01:25:17.440 broadly my thesis was if I were to pick
01:25:20.199 up many independent restaurants what is
01:25:23.159 the word used yeah CDR casual dining
01:25:25.719 restaurants casual dining restaurants if
01:25:27.440 I were to aggregate a bunch of them
01:25:29.920 bring them together create one entity
01:25:34.199 which has a few hundred of them my
01:25:37.440 valuation that I get from the equity
01:25:39.840 markets when I go to raise
01:25:42.239 money will be a bridge or an Arbitrage
01:25:45.199 between the discrepancy of the 10
01:25:48.719 multiple that CDR is getting now and the
01:25:51.560 100 multiple that qsr is getting do you
01:25:53.920 think that makes sense only if your
01:25:56.199 potential investor will see scale in
01:25:57.920 each of those entities that you've
01:25:59.280 wrapped up into one you're saying there
01:26:00.679 is scale because you're transitioning
01:26:02.480 well to tier two tier three you could
01:26:05.080 look at it from that perspective but if
01:26:07.679 a sophisticated investor would look at
01:26:09.199 it they would probably say that your as
01:26:14.719 a whole as some of a whole you
01:26:16.719 definitely have this you know large um
01:26:19.760 scale and as a result in every city you
01:26:22.360 could each open each one of these 10
01:26:23.880 brands and have 10 restaurants per per
01:26:26.480 um per City however I think a more
01:26:29.800 sophisticated investor will look at the
01:26:31.600 scalability of each of those 10 brands
01:26:34.360 right this is a model that could work
01:26:36.320 again you know I think uh if You' got 10
01:26:38.960 brands that are in the CDR space and
01:26:40.639 affordable and they have scale potential
01:26:43.320 you could you could have many Brands
01:26:46.040 there's what we do Phoenix is doing they
01:26:49.440 are buying Phenix so basically the house
01:26:51.199 of Brands is a story see the point
01:26:54.119 is what 85% of the processes are the
01:26:57.960 same for restauran thing right you
01:27:01.119 negotiating the right lease getting the
01:27:03.880 licenses hiring training setting up
01:27:06.840 management information systems HR
01:27:09.199 licensing all other same what changes is
01:27:11.159 what's on the wall and what's on the
01:27:13.000 menu right that's 15% of the business
01:27:15.719 85% is all the other stuff that really
01:27:18.679 that 15% is just the details but we are
01:27:21.320 seeing that India is invest is dining
01:27:23.760 out a lot more they're going to cdas a
01:27:25.760 lot more the market is four times as big
01:27:28.600 is growing at at 20% whereas qsrs have
01:27:33.280 kind of hit a road
01:27:34.840 bump the the only problem is the only
01:27:37.679 problem is that of course because we are
01:27:40.040 seeing people now premiumize right we
01:27:42.080 seeing people wanting a better quality
01:27:44.280 of life a better quality of
01:27:45.960 Lifestyle the problem is there have not
01:27:48.000 been any precedents and there have been
01:27:49.400 too many dead bodies in the CD r space
01:27:53.000 and there have been quite a few success
01:27:54.480 stories in the qsr space right so the
01:27:58.239 entire value chain now is singing this
01:28:01.360 one song it's going to take one guy to
01:28:03.320 come along change the rules and then
01:28:05.320 everything else will change I think one
01:28:06.639 person has already come I think barbecue
01:28:08.159 nation is doing a damn good job of now
01:28:10.600 getting multiples House of brasas they
01:28:14.800 I'm talking about a I'm talking about a
01:28:16.239 CDR matching up to the scale potential
01:28:19.360 of a qsr for example I mean
01:28:22.560 uh they also follow that process of
01:28:24.239 choosing back of you know back and
01:28:26.520 Beyond kind of locations but they have
01:28:28.239 such brand pull that they're able to do
01:28:29.679 crazy numbers and they're trading at
01:28:31.920 many I mean I know stock market goes up
01:28:33.800 and down they listed soed and they are
01:28:36.159 trading at many multiples of sale and
01:28:38.080 obviously at one point in time they were
01:28:39.320 beating even the likes of qsr certain
01:28:41.119 qsrs in on the stock stock market that
01:28:43.520 changes every day so don't Puja uh for
01:28:47.639 your category let's say macarons deserts
01:28:50.840 all of that do you see scope in
01:28:53.840 restaurants being built around that or
01:28:55.920 do you think the cafe model is more the
01:28:58.000 way to
01:28:59.679 go restaurants focusing on desserts like
01:29:03.719 there are often times you would go to a
01:29:05.320 restaurant I go to certain places where
01:29:07.639 I love the dessert and I eat the food
01:29:09.840 because I can eat this at the end what
01:29:11.880 is the dessert contribution in in your
01:29:14.679 restaurants I don't think it's very high
01:29:16.560 and half% it's not very high but that's
01:29:18.760 my
01:29:20.280 restaurant the it's different right I
01:29:23.040 mean I mean look we had a we had a a
01:29:26.280 cafe I wouldn't call it a full-fed
01:29:28.560 restaurant but it was a cafe but 30% of
01:29:31.440 our Revenue did come from desserts 30%
01:29:34.320 came from food and the rest came from
01:29:36.719 beverages coffee um coffee and tea
01:29:39.400 coffee is really growing right coffee is
01:29:40.880 really growing is that something you
01:29:42.360 would consider um it's a whole different
01:29:45.480 I think coffee and dessert is you know
01:29:47.199 just it's a marriage that's made in
01:29:49.440 heaven I would love to do it now yes
01:29:52.719 do you think this whole Trend at least
01:29:55.119 in the premium segment if premiumization
01:29:57.920 is working like riy said and the premium
01:30:00.400 segment will grow
01:30:02.080 faster this health not eating sugar
01:30:05.000 staying away from dessert do you think
01:30:07.600 those things will become significantly
01:30:10.920 bigger issues for someone like you 100%
01:30:13.880 And and that's that's something I'm
01:30:15.199 actively working on as well um and I'm
01:30:17.960 seeing that from the last like 13 years
01:30:20.400 to today um I don't know who it was but
01:30:22.560 they told me that sugar is going to be
01:30:23.639 the next tobacco sugar already is the
01:30:25.880 next tobacco no don't say that Jamie
01:30:27.560 Oliver listen here's the thing should be
01:30:29.199 tax like nobody stopped smoking
01:30:30.560 cigarettes and nobody stopped eating
01:30:32.320 dessert and that is what you remember
01:30:34.320 but yeah I am working on something that
01:30:35.880 is going to be it's a very low base
01:30:38.199 right now the health conscious people
01:30:40.199 when people are going out they're going
01:30:41.199 out to indulge I also feel like people
01:30:43.360 want
01:30:44.119 to think that they're eating healthier
01:30:46.639 no one really yeah can that ever truly
01:30:49.480 work like can you replace sugar with M
01:30:52.080 fruit or Stevia you can and taste that
01:30:54.679 good uh that's what we attempting to do
01:30:57.480 hopefully we get there by January so
01:31:00.239 what is the healthier alternative if I
01:31:01.840 am a young I mean it depends on what it
01:31:04.159 depends on what your you know everyone
01:31:06.000 has a different so for him it could be
01:31:08.159 uh gluten for example for somebody else
01:31:10.000 it could be sugar if I want to replace
01:31:11.320 sugar with a healthier option which
01:31:13.520 tastes just as good in your opinion what
01:31:16.000 is it today um I mean see all of them
01:31:19.199 will spike your glucose levels right
01:31:20.800 whether you take jaggery or you take um
01:31:22.920 no no he's saying he's talking about
01:31:24.440 replacement repl I'm saying not glucose
01:31:27.560 non glucose non glucose sweetness so
01:31:30.440 jaggy would not be an option then you're
01:31:33.400 saying no monk fruit is the new super
01:31:36.719 product monk fruit is great I would use
01:31:38.480 a lot of natur not to Stevia like you
01:31:40.639 you had like a expression of disgust
01:31:42.760 when I said it's got really bad
01:31:44.159 aftertaste like metallic yeah it's not
01:31:46.880 it's not very good there's another
01:31:48.080 problem with stevia the new study the
01:31:50.360 stabilizer used in svia the way we eat
01:31:53.119 it is um supposed to increase chances of
01:31:56.000 stroke significantly As Natural sugars
01:31:59.719 fruit dates things that are more but
01:32:02.679 that's tested glucose or it's not it's
01:32:04.960 not a sugar replacement you're just
01:32:06.920 Ching the sauce and the mineral content
01:32:08.560 of the gr but then your options are all
01:32:10.239 chemicals then only monk fruit I think
01:32:13.239 example it's a question of taste right
01:32:14.719 if you see how many people have
01:32:16.080 transitioned from Coke to Diet Coke
01:32:18.600 seamlessly and yes the first four five
01:32:22.719 times you're like what is this taste but
01:32:24.800 once you get into that kind of flavor
01:32:27.199 right then you stop noticing so it just
01:32:30.719 becomes a thing like I'm going to drink
01:32:32.760 diet coke now if I get Coke in I drink
01:32:35.280 Coke I'm like what the hell is this I
01:32:36.639 don't even like it anymore no that's
01:32:38.639 yeah but the point is that whole
01:32:40.679 company's transitioned on this premise
01:32:43.520 what do you think the big opportunity is
01:32:45.119 there in your
01:32:46.679 space if somebody were to be passionate
01:32:49.760 about pastries like you I I would say
01:32:51.679 for me especially cuz this is something
01:32:53.520 that I struggle with a lot as well and
01:32:56.400 um I think that for me I still when I
01:32:59.639 when I don't want to eat sugar I still
01:33:01.119 want to eat something that tastes quite
01:33:03.440 similar um but I'm happier to eat
01:33:05.800 something that is natural sugar like so
01:33:07.719 if it's sweetened with bananas or dates
01:33:09.800 or apples it just feels like it's giving
01:33:11.960 me a lot more than using plain white
01:33:14.440 sugar so I think that the opportunity is
01:33:16.199 how can you make a cleaner you know
01:33:18.760 Indulgence which is not okay so the qsr
01:33:22.520 industry in us for example is 50% in
01:33:26.600 China is 20% in Korea is 30% of of that
01:33:30.520 market of that market in India is just
01:33:33.280 3% today in UK you're saying it's it's
01:33:35.800 50% of the US US yeah us yes us I I read
01:33:40.159 this number that as much as 60% of
01:33:43.239 overall consumption in the country is
01:33:45.159 qsr really of food no just consumption
01:33:49.199 overall consumption across the GDP yeah
01:33:51.320 AC across the GDP across the consumption
01:33:53.880 Spectre and see most of the money people
01:33:56.600 spend is on food right like even in
01:33:58.560 India consumption income yeah between
01:34:00.639 groceries and eating out and delivery
01:34:02.560 and all of this is a large part of
01:34:04.440 consumption I think the US the rent will
01:34:06.560 probably be the biggest but you're right
01:34:08.159 I think in terms of gross disposable
01:34:09.639 income spend food would be highest they
01:34:11.480 don't cook at home yeah they eat out
01:34:13.199 more often than anybody except the
01:34:14.639 singaporeans so which way do you think
01:34:16.239 India will go India is at 3% do you
01:34:17.960 think we'll go the China way where there
01:34:20.920 seems to be a balance of dinin qsr all
01:34:25.960 of that working which qsr has only grown
01:34:28.199 to 20% and stopped there I think that's
01:34:30.440 a cultural difference you think India is
01:34:33.199 more going to mimic China than America
01:34:35.719 because culturally we are similar my
01:34:37.719 boat goes to China it's it's it look in
01:34:43.080 America fast food works because it's
01:34:45.280 labor Arbitrage you go to a supermarket
01:34:48.520 you buy the ingredients you chop it you
01:34:51.119 cook it it you stir it you plate it you
01:34:53.480 wash the dishes after that is going to
01:34:55.639 cost you more than going to a qsr
01:34:58.800 ordering that that burger that fry that
01:35:01.280 shake is going to be cheaper faster
01:35:03.719 quicker and in in India it's not that
01:35:06.400 yet it's still cheaper to make food at
01:35:08.360 home it's the labor or the labor
01:35:11.159 Arbitrage is still not considered that
01:35:13.000 important right always going to be uh
01:35:15.920 somebody at home who's who's happy to
01:35:17.600 cook for you who's going to happily
01:35:19.560 clean the dishes for you so that that
01:35:22.360 price Arbitrage is not there so the
01:35:23.760 value Seekers will continue is that what
01:35:26.119 could actually help your industry
01:35:27.719 eventually if cost of Labor goes up it
01:35:30.920 will go it will go up because you see
01:35:33.920 right now one in four employable people
01:35:38.639 are Indians in the world one out of 6
01:35:41.560 and a half is Indian one out of four in
01:35:44.159 the world and somewhere the demand and
01:35:46.080 Supply is going to equalize we anyway
01:35:48.480 seeing um a lot of strain on on the
01:35:51.800 labor department Canada has opened up
01:35:53.600 his his gateways they taking in as many
01:35:55.679 people the Middle East is taking in you
01:35:58.119 know shiploads of people from India and
01:36:01.119 I'm talking only about in the
01:36:02.199 hospitality that'll make it more
01:36:03.840 expensive for you in it will get so this
01:36:06.080 this demand Supply you know Gap is going
01:36:08.600 to how has the cost of Labor gone up for
01:36:10.880 you in your restaurants let's say over
01:36:12.880 the last 5 years I think what has
01:36:15.000 happened is we have look you want to be
01:36:18.520 south of 15% when it comes to your labor
01:36:20.440 cost that is a broad level thumb room so
01:36:23.199 30% cost of goods 35% cogs right you got
01:36:28.320 15% labor 15% uh rental 15% incidental
01:36:34.600 you want to make 20 to 25%
01:36:37.480 marketing about 3% or 4% is that all
01:36:41.080 yeah what is working in marketing now I
01:36:43.639 see Puja is very active on social media
01:36:46.440 right what percentage of your clientele
01:36:50.000 is coming in through social media media
01:36:51.719 and what is working I'm guessing
01:36:53.639 Performance
01:36:55.040 Marketing in the manner that worked a
01:36:57.400 few years ago with Facebook and
01:36:58.960 Instagram ads and Google ads I don't
01:37:01.239 think that works as well anymore right
01:37:03.360 no so I think for me um social media
01:37:05.840 just started off as something that I was
01:37:07.920 just doing because it felt very natural
01:37:10.960 uh the phone was like the extension of
01:37:12.560 my hand I was in the kitchen making a
01:37:14.400 cake you were a natural you are a
01:37:15.920 natural with that reals I can't so
01:37:18.159 anyway so I take but that's working more
01:37:19.880 right videos are working
01:37:21.760 more than pictures yeah so what works
01:37:24.040 give me two
01:37:25.119 hacks why does have 7 million followers
01:37:28.360 where others do not what works now I
01:37:30.600 don't know what worked for you uh being
01:37:34.639 in the right place at the right time
01:37:36.600 describe that I knew that was going to
01:37:39.320 come back and bite me but you s you reap
01:37:43.480 yeah elaborate there's one thing I've
01:37:45.719 gotten from you also I'll use it later
01:37:47.960 um I think it was a time when um
01:37:51.920 Instagram wasn't as uh big as it is
01:37:55.639 today it was more organic um and I just
01:37:58.480 feel that I was in a space where I had a
01:38:00.840 lot of customers uh who were very
01:38:03.440 popular and who are very popular and
01:38:05.400 well known and have millions and
01:38:07.400 millions of followers and um I think it
01:38:10.560 was also me sharing my whole experience
01:38:14.000 about building L 15 I've always been
01:38:16.040 honest open did that help your personal
01:38:18.000 story yes 100% cuz people related to it
01:38:20.760 right people love a story they're like
01:38:22.480 okay it was as much about you as it was
01:38:24.760 about the picture of the food you were
01:38:26.119 putting on exactly and I would and I
01:38:28.719 would be honest what made your story
01:38:31.159 interesting um I don't know I think it
01:38:33.800 was just a girl at that age doing
01:38:36.080 something different um following her
01:38:39.119 passion like a lot of people feel like
01:38:41.760 you know like did it come across on
01:38:43.119 screen your passion like when you spoke
01:38:44.840 about food is that something that really
01:38:46.679 worked I think so I like to believe
01:38:49.480 so and I and for me it was that right um
01:38:53.440 so two things that worked was one being
01:38:56.800 at the right place at the right time and
01:38:58.040 two just uh I think
01:39:00.679 uh honestly I don't know I think you're
01:39:03.000 cutting yourself a little short I think
01:39:05.920 her content quality was I didn't even
01:39:08.920 know that that was content right like I
01:39:10.440 didn't know I was just doing it because
01:39:12.760 I L doing it and I enjoyed doing it I
01:39:14.760 didn't realiz that was creating content
01:39:17.639 and you know I was just like I'm
01:39:19.000 documenting my life and I'm talking
01:39:21.360 about what a great day I had in the
01:39:22.560 kitchen someone who's working with me
01:39:24.639 what's happening this dinner stuff like
01:39:27.320 that and it just became like a a window
01:39:29.400 into my life is there any agency used
01:39:32.360 you used anyone that helped you creating
01:39:35.119 this content that other people can use
01:39:37.760 no I just feel that when you it I feel
01:39:40.159 when you're authentic about your story
01:39:41.599 and you do it yourself it's a lot it it
01:39:45.599 it hits a lot uh deeper than if someone
01:39:48.119 else is creating it for you um even if
01:39:50.800 someone agencies building that content
01:39:52.679 for you I think it should be driven The
01:39:54.480 Narrative should be driven by you that
01:39:55.920 supersedes quality of video 100% and
01:40:00.119 things that we see that right now right
01:40:02.520 like things that we post just randomly
01:40:05.000 reals which are just like a half eat in
01:40:06.719 something will do so much better than
01:40:09.239 something that is orchestrated and
01:40:10.760 created and product you know it's a
01:40:13.040 production I want to ask you a question
01:40:15.239 actually finally sure what do you look
01:40:18.800 at when you you said you've invested in
01:40:21.119 certain restaurants and cafes and things
01:40:23.880 what is it that you look at financials
01:40:27.040 first uh at reasonable valuations I'm a
01:40:30.719 stock market guy right like I look at
01:40:32.440 public markets very closely so when I
01:40:35.199 saw qsr chains getting the multiple that
01:40:39.280 they are while they are just franchise
01:40:41.599 models replicating a foreign product in
01:40:45.840 necessarily not a Innovative way I don't
01:40:48.040 think they deserve that valuation I
01:40:50.440 don't think
01:40:52.000 think din in restaurants deserve the low
01:40:55.239 valuation they they are getting as well
01:40:57.440 because to be fair to them they're
01:40:59.639 creating a more nuanced product than a
01:41:01.960 qsr chain and here I'll tell you
01:41:04.119 something it's you know India is a
01:41:06.119 market without precent right it is
01:41:08.320 unique in many ways uh we spoke about uh
01:41:12.040 consistency mhm the whole point in and
01:41:15.719 and you know I think a lot of tsrs have
01:41:18.040 have TomTom consistency perhaps because
01:41:20.960 don't want to tell you what is going
01:41:22.599 into the Patty or what is how much
01:41:24.960 cheese is in the sauce right that is not
01:41:27.560 something that you want it to be
01:41:29.520 available for public consumption that's
01:41:31.599 something you got and then you put the
01:41:33.080 gar of consistency on it the fact
01:41:35.280 remains is that flavor profiles change
01:41:37.840 every 100 kilometers we in Delhi we like
01:41:41.239 red chili spice yeah right in
01:41:43.599 Maharashtra we like a green chilies but
01:41:45.239 we like our food little katam we like a
01:41:49.159 little in Gujarat we like
01:41:52.360 in in in the south of India we like
01:41:54.199 black pepper spice and these are the
01:41:56.599 flavors that we like and this is a
01:41:58.639 Biryani it's it's so the the karda
01:42:01.760 Biryani is different from the Tamil
01:42:04.320 Biryani is different from the Hyderabad
01:42:06.320 that you go to the the M Salon and used
01:42:10.280 to a Bombay Biryani with Alo a Kata
01:42:12.840 Biryani with Al so flavors change right
01:42:15.040 yeah we are a country which eats
01:42:17.080 differently we we we share things you
01:42:19.719 know we don't
01:42:21.639 appetizer main cost our own dessert yeah
01:42:24.599 we like to pick we like food fresh right
01:42:27.880 we we like this is in a way your case
01:42:29.719 against qsr it's not my case against qsr
01:42:32.119 it's my case for India right I think
01:42:35.280 that you have to create products for
01:42:37.320 India find the new India and India you
01:42:39.599 have to create a product which is more
01:42:41.040 nuanced than a q a product which
01:42:43.639 understands India more culturally you
01:42:45.599 can't force it and even even all the qsr
01:42:48.280 have come in have at some point of time
01:42:50.440 what they they call Innovation have had
01:42:52.599 to indianized right and they call they
01:42:55.119 calling it Innovation but the fact
01:42:57.280 remains is that culturally we like to we
01:42:59.000 like to share things right we
01:43:02.440 like you know so do we like to see a
01:43:05.280 sandwich which has been lying there in
01:43:06.599 the fridge for 4 hours necessarily we we
01:43:09.639 abort it right if a ro FKA comes one
01:43:13.480 will come then another one come then
01:43:15.239 another will come we like our food
01:43:17.320 really piping hot K the coffee that you
01:43:19.760 get we you don't like that coffee so
01:43:21.800 many times you you know you you you're
01:43:23.960 doing guret coffee you don't want to
01:43:25.119 burn it you don't take it over 90° but
01:43:28.480 if you give an Indian coffee Which is
01:43:29.960 less than 100 it's going to send back
01:43:31.800 here tundy right so I'm I'm not saying
01:43:34.560 good bad ugly whatever I'm not judging
01:43:36.360 but this is how we consume this is how
01:43:39.400 we like our food we like anyone building
01:43:42.400 for India the nuanced India that you
01:43:44.840 spoke about you're saying hit a micro
01:43:48.239 Market don't build anything generic that
01:43:49.960 you think the entire country will like
01:43:52.000 no I'm saying that one will denight
01:43:54.520 Delight in all manifestations of this
01:43:56.719 thing right we by Nature when we think
01:43:59.520 about food we think about variety right
01:44:01.920 resta but give me a definitive tip that
01:44:04.119 me as a 20-year-old trying to start a
01:44:06.880 restaurant I get that India is nuanced I
01:44:09.760 get that people in south west east north
01:44:12.639 all like different things if I were to
01:44:15.520 go about building a restaurant business
01:44:17.560 how do I utilize that see definitely
01:44:19.679 novelty will get you the the attention
01:44:23.199 but Comfort will get you the repeat
01:44:25.400 business where where and I think that
01:44:27.800 that's a significant difference between
01:44:29.520 your Cafe business and the restaurant
01:44:31.679 business because in in restaurants we're
01:44:34.119 looking for novelty we're looking for
01:44:36.080 elevation we're looking for experience
01:44:38.719 in a cafe we're looking for Community
01:44:40.560 we're looking for convenience we're
01:44:42.199 looking for comfort and their frequency
01:44:44.679 as a use case is way higher like if
01:44:47.080 today I I I love his food I think one of
01:44:50.119 you know of the best Indian restaurants
01:44:51.719 in India and in the world are from his
01:44:55.199 table he gives best quality service best
01:44:58.000 quality food best quality value you know
01:45:01.400 I I treat like a king but tomorrow I'm
01:45:05.000 going to be
01:45:06.480 like
01:45:08.599 Chinese
01:45:10.239 Kore you know it it so you will you will
01:45:14.920 seek variety but in a in a in a cafe you
01:45:19.040 not going to say k to Starbucks together
01:45:22.199 M you'll be it's it's something that you
01:45:24.679 want to kind of reach out for
01:45:26.440 automatically so there's a distinction
01:45:28.920 between a cafe and a restaurant in that
01:45:31.719 sense and there'll always be a
01:45:33.199 distinction between are you trying to
01:45:34.560 sell a novel product which people is a
01:45:36.440 new new thing is it a custard fil
01:45:39.040 cruffin or am I giving you a moti Cho
01:45:42.520 ladu which is going to last or am I
01:45:44.520 taking a m l and making it into cavier
01:45:47.199 like what does and I think there's a
01:45:49.400 market for it all because we seek it by
01:45:52.320 Nature we seek it we are we are
01:45:54.440 comfortable with four mobile phone
01:45:56.400 providers we are comfortable with 20
01:45:58.719 shirt makers they're comfortable with 30
01:46:01.119 watch makers but when it comes to food
01:46:04.480 we want thousands and thousands of
01:46:06.840 restaurants and that's the way it is
01:46:09.719 interesting so the unorganized sector in
01:46:12.440 India is disproportionately large
01:46:14.880 compared to the US China Europe if we
01:46:18.560 were to I don't have the exact numbers
01:46:20.159 for 7 65 for 35 65 unorganized 65
01:46:24.920 unorganized and we are assuming the
01:46:27.080 industry put together is between 50 to
01:46:29.480 10000
01:46:30.480 billion we couldn't find the exact
01:46:32.560 number because it's hard to yeah so
01:46:35.239 about uh 40 to 50 50 to 55 50 50 billion
01:46:40.560 is and as growing compounded annually at
01:46:43.360 20% 21% CDR so what is what is the big
01:46:47.320 opportunity when unorganized transitions
01:46:49.840 to organize
01:46:52.239 I think which will happen in inevitably
01:46:55.360 organized is growing at a much faster
01:46:57.040 rate than un organiz organ unorganized
01:46:59.679 is also growing but organized is growing
01:47:02.520 faster we are seeing movement towards
01:47:05.639 Brands uh you know established Brands
01:47:08.440 reputed brands people are gravitating
01:47:10.119 towards it but again what is a brand
01:47:12.599 right you know uh in Bombay Sardar paaji
01:47:16.360 started off with you know Taylor now is
01:47:19.080 a brand right uh uh kti College
01:47:23.280 W is still roadside food but is also a
01:47:27.080 br sorry so I think that uh people are
01:47:31.040 are wanting to move towards Branch
01:47:32.480 because they don't they don't want to
01:47:34.159 risk that investment that they're doing
01:47:37.040 in a bad quality product yeah this just
01:47:39.960 questions to remind me sorry please
01:47:42.880 continue that's it I finish my P and do
01:47:45.639 you think quality is a big factor
01:47:47.760 playing into why people go for a brand
01:47:49.560 because people are unsure of what food
01:47:51.280 there might be I think it plays a
01:47:54.639 massive role in the perception of
01:47:57.400 quality is perhaps one
01:48:01.880 major parameter that you have to take
01:48:04.280 off before you choose which place to
01:48:09.639 patronize convenience is I think perhaps
01:48:12.960 an equally big factor how easily you can
01:48:15.639 get to it how easily you can park there
01:48:19.239 um what kind of option does it serve can
01:48:21.360 my whole family be served see Indians
01:48:22.920 eat out in families we don't just go
01:48:24.599 husband and wife we go with husband wife
01:48:26.880 kids sometimes grandparents sometimes
01:48:28.639 parents so they want China That's why
01:48:30.679 multi Cuisine does so well in India D
01:48:33.000 dad can eat can that ever work Z like if
01:48:36.239 I had a restaurant where I do Chinese
01:48:38.159 tanduri Japanese Indian and something
01:48:40.159 else can I do justice to any of that you
01:48:43.000 can't I don't so here's the thing the
01:48:45.599 market has proven that it works so
01:48:48.040 financially it's going to now that's all
01:48:49.760 that's working I get annoyed each time I
01:48:51.320 see that you can't have a speciality
01:48:53.719 restaurant that excels in everything no
01:48:56.639 in the same kitchen if you got you can't
01:48:59.239 have really the very best of Indian food
01:49:02.239 and then you know you suddenly have the
01:49:03.880 very best of Japanese food cuz you have
01:49:06.440 one Chef right no no one main Che there
01:49:08.440 are departments there are sections
01:49:11.280 within every kitchen every section has
01:49:14.080 its own but if I'm making garam masala
01:49:16.280 here can I be making sushi on the side
01:49:18.400 and well people are doing it people are
01:49:20.599 doing it can they it
01:49:22.599 well it can be done to a competent level
01:49:26.199 I don't think it can be done as well as
01:49:28.360 say a restaurant specializing in sushi
01:49:30.320 will you get as good as sushi at um you
01:49:32.840 know for example you believe it or not
01:49:34.440 hams give Sushi okay and U will it be as
01:49:38.520 good as say u a papaya or a yaoa or
01:49:42.679 sorry yaa doesn't do sushi but like our
01:49:44.440 Coco you probably um will see a
01:49:48.199 difference but the market is what
01:49:50.840 dictates what you serve and multi-
01:49:52.760 Cuisine even though um it's something
01:49:55.679 that uh forms a very small part of my
01:49:57.760 system I think has its has made its
01:50:01.400 space Indians go out in families D is
01:50:04.119 eating something else children are
01:50:05.119 eating something else the husband and
01:50:07.239 wife are eating something else but can a
01:50:09.639 speciality restaurant perhaps produced a
01:50:11.599 higher quality uh experience a
01:50:15.159 speciality restaurant will probably
01:50:16.239 create a higher quality experience for
01:50:18.040 sure it can it's not it's not impossible
01:50:20.320 if you go if you think about like you
01:50:22.119 think of a hotel right let's say take a
01:50:24.080 hotel which has exceptional Cuisine and
01:50:26.440 there are hotels like that it's all H by
01:50:28.520 one Chef right is there no actually
01:50:31.719 hotel has different disciplines every
01:50:34.599 every kitchen would have its own Chef
01:50:36.239 yes but you have one executive chef for
01:50:38.080 the whole hotel right you have special
01:50:39.920 but they all report to one Chef so in
01:50:41.960 that what I was trying to say is that um
01:50:45.119 I think the context in which you're
01:50:46.560 consuming food is also very very
01:50:48.159 important right I mean you can if you
01:50:51.639 are you're consuming Japanese then to
01:50:53.320 have food in that kind of context adds
01:50:55.760 value to it right right if you are if
01:50:57.719 you eating
01:51:00.239 um Empire kebabs and at that particular
01:51:04.239 point of time being in that area of
01:51:06.040 sitting in your car has context to it so
01:51:09.079 how big how big is Ambiance I think it's
01:51:13.119 I was the kind of guy who 10 years ago
01:51:15.000 would say to you that food is number one
01:51:16.840 priority and everything else revolves
01:51:18.880 around it so you can't eat the painting
01:51:20.320 you can't eat the floor you can't eat
01:51:21.679 the beautiful sculpture that you got but
01:51:23.520 you can't eat the food on the plate over
01:51:25.360 the years I will have to accept that
01:51:27.880 Ambience perhaps plays an equally
01:51:29.520 important role because it changes the
01:51:31.679 way how you
01:51:32.800 feel but to each their own I am the kind
01:51:35.639 of person who go and hunt for a Food
01:51:37.280 Spot even in bil Lanes my favorite
01:51:40.639 restaurant not sometimes you look for
01:51:44.159 Ambiance person would not person some
01:51:47.400 days you would some days you would look
01:51:48.679 for and the and the culture that I'm
01:51:50.199 trying to build uh within our within our
01:51:52.639 specific uh company is that you have
01:51:54.840 strike a balance so the food has to be
01:51:57.079 the main main stay but if it looks good
01:51:59.360 it feels good people have gone into this
01:52:01.520 showoff situation if you look at Dubai
01:52:03.119 Dubai has some some of the greatest
01:52:04.400 restaurants now but Dubai first started
01:52:06.719 becoming a city where the look and field
01:52:08.560 was perhaps more important than was
01:52:10.000 being served some of the best
01:52:11.679 restaurants were not doing as well as
01:52:12.960 the ones that were that looked great it
01:52:14.719 has to be a balance it has to be a
01:52:16.040 combination I can I ask a parallel
01:52:18.000 question why does food in India never
01:52:21.199 taste at par with the best restaurants
01:52:24.000 of Dubai London and stuff is it
01:52:25.840 ingredients which are not
01:52:27.560 available honestly I think in many cases
01:52:30.400 Indian food tastes better I'm not food
01:52:32.840 in India I mean I mean food in India
01:52:35.040 tastes better I can tell you that a
01:52:37.280 macaroon that she makes is not going to
01:52:39.199 be much different in fact even May
01:52:41.360 Superior if Puja was in France she was
01:52:44.000 in Paris the access to ingredients she
01:52:46.440 would have would be betterred her
01:52:48.360 macaron in Paris would taste better than
01:52:50.480 roed quality yeah the Almond the kind of
01:52:52.920 almond you would choose and stuff like
01:52:54.239 that but so I had I'll give an example
01:52:57.159 why are those ingredients not available
01:52:58.760 in India is it because the customer will
01:53:00.760 not pay the price to Warrant it in some
01:53:03.159 cases yes the whole supply chain right
01:53:06.320 like by the time you get in get the
01:53:08.040 ingredients here the whole by the time
01:53:10.639 it reaches you but I wondered we grow
01:53:13.360 like all that they grow there here as
01:53:15.880 well right like why is that so much
01:53:17.639 better quality but I don't think it is
01:53:19.000 better I do not think that is better no
01:53:21.040 so I think it's I think it's Puja de go
01:53:23.880 on can I say basically if we take the
01:53:27.880 same standard recipe and we take it to
01:53:29.840 Delhi it'll be different it'll taste
01:53:31.719 much better in Delhi
01:53:33.560 yeah 100% yeah but if I bring it to
01:53:36.800 Bombay also from in Bangalore to me
01:53:39.280 it'll taste better in Bangalore because
01:53:41.480 the quality of ingredients available is
01:53:43.119 there also there is no artisanal Pride
01:53:45.960 right now in our agricultural economy
01:53:48.040 right we there's no guy who's you know
01:53:50.880 massaging uh the feet of the cattle or
01:53:54.280 or their livestock
01:53:55.880 oring yeah but I'm talking I a lot of
01:53:59.320 Aral farmer
01:54:01.079 markets I think there's some really good
01:54:03.040 stuff growing yes it's growing but look
01:54:04.480 at the base it's operating and and I'm
01:54:06.360 talking about look at the larger
01:54:07.760 ecosystem I you're not going to get a
01:54:08.920 beautiful locky right now well artial
01:54:11.679 Pride I mean because people don't get
01:54:13.199 rewarded for that they are right now
01:54:15.239 they are the way the entire agricultural
01:54:18.320 value chain is set up right it is the
01:54:20.480 mbas who are going you know and and
01:54:22.960 going back to the Villages buying land
01:54:25.000 and deploying scientific method and
01:54:26.840 they're coming up with all these
01:54:27.760 beautiful things yes but the larger
01:54:30.000 ecosystem where which is the Mundy
01:54:31.880 system where you know it's a commodity
01:54:34.000 system they are not being rewarded for
01:54:36.000 artisinal products they're not they are
01:54:38.199 more concerned with keeping their crop
01:54:40.119 alive than making sure they don't going
01:54:42.079 to risk they they they you know they
01:54:44.679 they barely hand to mouth they cannot
01:54:46.760 afford to take chances with their CR I
01:54:48.199 think the question is to you guys like
01:54:50.239 would you buy if you get artisanal
01:54:52.400 produce at three times the cost of
01:54:55.040 current produce why would artisanal
01:54:56.679 produce cost three okay one and a half
01:54:58.560 times but why would organic cost more
01:55:01.280 than inorganic I'm guessing artial can't
01:55:03.960 be M simple thing is yield is the yield
01:55:07.320 dictates that I think the chemicals
01:55:09.280 increase yield right yeah that's right
01:55:11.079 the GMO may increase yield but uh the
01:55:15.679 the cost of producing
01:55:17.520 something is is actually cheap with
01:55:19.920 organic than it is with inorganic we've
01:55:22.239 done a lot of work on this one we've
01:55:24.199 gone we've gone deep into provenance we
01:55:26.360 had we've had four provenance officers
01:55:28.800 going in understanding the
01:55:30.960 product uh is what we get in India
01:55:33.840 called organic actually organic so one
01:55:35.920 is the fact that it is well you could
01:55:38.520 you could go go back like four years ago
01:55:41.040 was there any pesticides use so I mean
01:55:43.520 it's still mky it's still transitioning
01:55:45.920 but again another thing is that when
01:55:47.400 you're importing things right India is a
01:55:50.440 agricultural economy so the tariffs and
01:55:54.079 excise is prohibitive for anything
01:55:56.280 excise for example if you were to import
01:55:59.199 Coffee Bean and I think Starbucks faces
01:56:00.920 challenge it's a 180% duty on coffee
01:56:03.679 it's more than what You' pay for a car
01:56:05.960 because you're protecting your
01:56:07.280 agricultural economy so so on one hand
01:56:10.159 you cannot import you know quality
01:56:12.000 ingredients on the other hand there is
01:56:13.880 no artisanal Pride on or or a system
01:56:17.000 that rewards artisanal uh agriculture
01:56:20.199 and then this Mundy system where there
01:56:21.639 is no provenance or accountability for
01:56:23.480 what you're really producing I think if
01:56:25.119 I have to just look at it from a dessert
01:56:26.639 lens 14 years ago it was so difficult to
01:56:29.920 find local ingredients right you had to
01:56:32.400 use imported chocolate you had to use
01:56:34.119 everything imported to get that same
01:56:36.199 quality and consistency but today 14
01:56:38.599 years later you get great Indian
01:56:40.199 chocolate uh we use as much local
01:56:42.760 ingredients as we can some things we
01:56:44.599 still have to use that are imported but
01:56:47.239 that change is happening so I would say
01:56:49.159 that it's
01:56:50.040 but today if you had to produce the
01:56:52.880 quality of macaron you did at College in
01:56:55.520 Paris in India how much more would it
01:56:58.000 cost
01:56:59.440 you I think we're pretty much at par cuz
01:57:02.440 we use you know the Almond flow we use
01:57:04.520 Etc it it is but if you were to bring it
01:57:07.239 from there and make it or if you were to
01:57:08.800 go there and make it yeah then I would
01:57:10.920 be selling there and make it it'll
01:57:12.159 probably I would be selling it for 300
01:57:14.040 bucks of macro importing it do you it
01:57:16.920 for now do you think there is a market
01:57:18.840 at 300 I mean lad exists in India so 300
01:57:24.159 yeah I think the question I'm trying to
01:57:26.599 get to is that if you guys were to
01:57:30.360 scatter one or two
01:57:32.079 restaurants which are Ultra Premium in
01:57:34.440 terms of produce and quality is there a
01:57:37.639 market like you charge five times more
01:57:39.480 than what you charge for a dish today
01:57:41.040 yeah absolutely then why are you not
01:57:42.960 attempting it we already quite premium
01:57:45.679 so I know but if there is a market there
01:57:48.960 at 3 00 rupees of macaroon why are you
01:57:50.800 not attempting
01:57:52.199 that we did try um with Louis burger
01:57:56.520 with the 88r burger with real truffles
01:57:59.280 real black truffle shavings yeah worked
01:58:01.840 very well at one point in time it was
01:58:03.119 10% of our sales it was a huge Market
01:58:05.440 but then it is a delivery Burger any of
01:58:07.480 the day and no matter what kind of
01:58:09.679 packaging you put around it it's hard to
01:58:11.400 sell a almost 900 rupe Burger to
01:58:14.079 somebody at home but I think there's a
01:58:16.840 huge market for the ultra fine dine uh
01:58:19.880 there are wonderful restaurants
01:58:21.360 including my own shamess PL scalable no
01:58:23.599 it's not it's not scalable so Masala
01:58:25.719 library for example is a restaurant that
01:58:27.199 I have I have one in Bombay another one
01:58:30.119 opening in Delhi and then I have one in
01:58:32.040 in duha in Qatar now these are all
01:58:33.679 premium restaurants the price per head
01:58:36.079 is 3 4,000 rupees per head you know with
01:58:39.079 liquor um they're not scalable but here
01:58:42.719 I can afford to buy the high-end produ
01:58:46.599 produce I can afford to buy the high-end
01:58:49.639 ingredients and I can afford to
01:58:52.079 buy the really high quality stuff right
01:58:56.239 so I can afford to buy those high
01:58:57.800 quality ingredients because I can sell
01:58:59.159 them at a higher price so some of these
01:59:01.400 things definitely do come into play yeah
01:59:03.599 and but there's a limited market can you
01:59:05.800 buy the same tomato uh or the same
01:59:08.440 vegetable at a price that is three times
01:59:11.440 uh because of it being organic and again
01:59:12.840 I think it's a heeld issue uh in all say
01:59:15.360 all fzy cafes it'll probably increase
01:59:17.199 the price I have to transfer some of
01:59:18.520 that price to the consumer
01:59:19.840 so there is a market for everything I
01:59:21.280 think but yes at this point time India
01:59:22.679 is not a very rich country we cannot we
01:59:23.960 cannot be delusional we still have a per
01:59:26.800 capita income of under
01:59:28.119 $4,000 and uh we still have 15% of the
01:59:31.560 population currently below the poverty
01:59:33.440 line at least by latest estimates I
01:59:34.880 think the number is a little bit higher
01:59:36.880 but India as a market from a food
01:59:40.320 perspective from a consumer consumer
01:59:41.960 perspective is going to be the biggest
01:59:44.920 uh the third biggest consumer Market in
01:59:46.599 the world by 2030 after the US and China
01:59:50.400 every time Z speaks I see a flag flying
01:59:53.000 on over his head so patriotic I am
01:59:55.480 extremely patriotic and I also and I
01:59:58.480 also believe in the future of this
01:59:59.520 country I think this is going to be in
02:00:01.599 fact uh the world's largest consumer
02:00:03.719 Market because of the simple rate of
02:00:05.560 growth of our population by 2050 should
02:00:08.119 we take like a tiny break yeah
02:00:10.620 [Music]
02:00:18.159 yeah
02:00:20.360 [Music]
02:00:26.880 this is the fancy one gold this is the
02:00:29.079 fancy one I can't wait to have the Louis
02:00:31.199 Burger man that looks
02:00:32.810 [Music]
02:00:33.960 amazing
02:00:35.639 M okay guys ready start what do you guys
02:00:39.400 think of celebrity owned restaurants M
02:00:43.320 far absolutely they never absolutely
02:00:46.360 worked worked very good you know the
02:00:49.960 only country in which you like it good
02:00:53.320 the only country in which a celebrity SL
02:00:56.000 sports star run restaurant is the most
02:00:58.320 popular Sri Lanka because their
02:01:00.920 celebrities are the cricketers so and
02:01:03.800 every other country in the world you
02:01:05.159 could take Planet Planet Hollywood okay
02:01:08.560 it had AR Schwarzenegger and Sylvester
02:01:10.320 Stallone as the founders bombed so many
02:01:13.880 I'm not going to take individual
02:01:15.000 restaurants numbers um if you look at
02:01:17.719 even within India sports stars have
02:01:19.280 owned restaurants Virat kohi Virat
02:01:22.320 kohy um Zahir Khan is not doing well
02:01:25.199 sain tandul isn't doing well when it is
02:01:27.520 when it is might be an exception that is
02:01:28.840 doing well in certain areas I'm just
02:01:30.280 saying in general they don't tend to do
02:01:32.119 that well celebrity owned all of your
02:01:34.840 restaurants all of are
02:01:37.239 rs so I think people see through it come
02:01:40.480 on um the only by the way the the most
02:01:43.480 successful Japanese celebrity for owning
02:01:45.239 a restaurant huh you a celebrity for
02:01:48.040 owning a restaurant so that's true we're
02:01:49.719 definitely Eternal optimists for owning
02:01:51.560 a restaurant so I think the only only
02:01:54.159 restaurant that is celebrity owned that
02:01:55.599 is a worldwide phenomena and extremely
02:01:57.920 successful is Believe It or Not
02:02:00.360 noou partially owned by Robert DeNiro in
02:02:03.960 fact the first original inesta when Chef
02:02:05.960 noo didn't have the money was so that's
02:02:08.239 that's trivia for you but yeah in
02:02:09.599 general I think people go to restaurants
02:02:11.079 for the overall experience celebrity can
02:02:13.960 probably pull you in for the launch can
02:02:16.480 probably pull you in for hosting the
02:02:18.679 right tables getting initially the buzz
02:02:20.960 going that buzz will last as much as the
02:02:23.480 first or second visit after that the
02:02:25.360 quality of the product has to
02:02:26.840 speak and restaurants which do these big
02:02:29.719 launches they call 500 people give them
02:02:32.040 free food and all of that does that
02:02:34.440 work you guys do that I we do it I do it
02:02:37.599 I think we all do it I mean I don't know
02:02:39.280 we definitely done that is that for your
02:02:40.719 own entertainment or is it for the
02:02:46.760 restaurant no we don't I don't we enjoy
02:02:49.280 that I mean we we bought to death of it
02:02:51.320 but the point is that you need to have a
02:02:53.760 good launch you need to have you know
02:02:55.840 you need to open up your social media
02:02:58.000 and see pictures of your favorite you
02:03:00.599 know so much noise right there you know
02:03:03.760 it creates it creates it does create for
02:03:06.000 more it does create urgency you know it
02:03:08.639 does create uh we need to go here you
02:03:10.880 know everybody people who come to attend
02:03:13.000 like somebody somebody like hosting
02:03:15.920 sometimes hosting so I'll tell you uh
02:03:17.920 you get to launch only once okay you get
02:03:20.520 to launch only once and if you don't
02:03:22.880 make a big enough buzz you probably will
02:03:25.920 have uh a slower more teid more a slower
02:03:29.880 more tepid uh kind of a you know uh
02:03:32.440 pickup so I think that's not necessarily
02:03:34.679 good especially with the high stakes
02:03:36.040 games that the restaurants are uh
02:03:38.360 definitely paying people to come no way
02:03:41.079 uh you often have PR companies that help
02:03:43.040 you with it and agencies that help you
02:03:44.480 with it so the payment should be
02:03:45.760 restricted to that not celebrities
02:03:47.599 coming in it's it's not going to help
02:03:49.320 you it's definitely not going to help
02:03:50.599 people come back but
02:03:52.559 models models are not paid they're just
02:03:54.559 given in kind by with free liquor and
02:03:57.400 food ryaz might have other ways of
02:04:00.880 recovering in kind of I I don't know
02:04:03.559 what you're
02:04:05.679 talking what about aggregator
02:04:08.040 relationships riyaz will take
02:04:10.480 this I heard like you guys are very p
02:04:13.119 with them and somebody's not paying them
02:04:15.119 anything and all of that no that's not
02:04:17.280 true please make me that person and let
02:04:19.639 me get access to that but maybe you're
02:04:21.159 paying 10% whereas everyone else is
02:04:23.280 paying 30 who is this nobody's paying
02:04:25.040 10% I think as far as I know they might
02:04:28.079 be if you do exclusivity they might give
02:04:29.480 you a lower percentage so first of all
02:04:31.840 let's be
02:04:33.119 honest there are lots of differential
02:04:35.480 pricing yeah which is available how do
02:04:38.199 you negotiate
02:04:39.719 it you would negotiate
02:04:42.360 it is it scale alone or is see I think
02:04:45.159 the guys who signed up at a particular
02:04:46.840 price point right in the early days they
02:04:50.119 started off with 10% that went to 12%
02:04:53.280 they went to
02:04:54.280 14% and right now it is at
02:04:57.800 a I think the only sustainable delivery
02:05:01.559 commission that is payable is 12% you
02:05:04.440 can't pay a single rupee more than that
02:05:06.280 however now the norm is 24 to 28%
02:05:10.880 they're signing at people at 24 and but
02:05:13.360 when you say 12% you mean including the
02:05:15.520 other cost because if you add I'm only
02:05:17.880 only talking about
02:05:19.719 delivery this is a triple D model okay
02:05:22.559 you got you've not just got your
02:05:23.800 delivery cost you've got your Discovery
02:05:25.559 cost which means that you're paying to
02:05:27.360 be visible in a carousel you're paying
02:05:29.159 to be visible in one of those
02:05:30.679 collections I think that they they you
02:05:33.000 would easily spend about 12% more on
02:05:35.679 that so you're looking at now 40% which
02:05:38.639 has gone to the ex on top of that your
02:05:40.920 average discounting is at 14 to 15% well
02:05:44.000 if you don't discount customers don't
02:05:45.520 come to you that is the way it has been
02:05:47.639 gained so how does work so
02:05:50.119 55% of your margins are taken by the
02:05:53.760 aggregators and they can't make money
02:05:56.559 with that kind of gos
02:05:58.520 Mark and you don't I'm telling you you
02:06:01.320 left with 45% to get cogs packaging
02:06:04.840 marketing which is non-app related
02:06:07.159 marketing right you got to build your
02:06:09.040 brand you got to do non app related
02:06:11.679 stuff uh your rentals your
02:06:14.440 salaries but why are people going to
02:06:17.239 aggregators because there's no other
02:06:19.280 alternative if you build your own Fleet
02:06:21.559 the cost would be prohibitive uh there
02:06:24.040 would be a risk associated with managing
02:06:25.559 the Manpower various things and the ease
02:06:28.360 of the consumer the consumer is so used
02:06:30.079 to using those apps is very hard so
02:06:33.679 sometimes we try and obviously we don't
02:06:34.880 get data from the aggregators so we want
02:06:36.360 to collect that data so we offer bigger
02:06:38.440 discounts to try and get that customer
02:06:40.639 to order directly and yet the adoption
02:06:43.079 rates are fairly Lowe agregator world
02:06:45.840 how did all this work phone we were
02:06:47.760 doing ourselves you're delivering
02:06:49.239 yourself and that's it was a small
02:06:51.159 business for and Domino they they
02:06:53.920 definitely have built the business but I
02:06:57.000 think the margins are not sustainable so
02:06:59.760 when he said 12% it's actually not 12%
02:07:01.559 it's more than that it's 12% plus
02:07:03.239 payment Gateway which you have to pay
02:07:04.480 anyway 2% plus GST will be 12% is the
02:07:07.119 only sustainable number that can but
02:07:08.840 you're talking about including taxes
02:07:10.040 because the GST is another big problem
02:07:11.559 for us right actually becomes the 12
02:07:13.440 becomes like 16 yeah and that's where
02:07:15.719 your margins get completely constrained
02:07:17.199 and they then say to build relevance the
02:07:20.280 term used um you have to spend more
02:07:23.800 money so I think um the platforms have
02:07:27.159 definitely built this huge market and
02:07:29.360 this ecosystem and made Indians fall in
02:07:32.079 love with delivery made it very easy
02:07:34.040 easy to get it convenient and
02:07:36.599 convenience will always win so there's
02:07:39.079 no point of it's going to be a uphill
02:07:41.199 battle to try and build your own system
02:07:43.840 uh if a lot of restaurants top delivery
02:07:45.880 Partners uh sorry top um restaurant
02:07:48.280 partn Partners get together and build
02:07:49.520 their own system might might potentially
02:07:51.920 work individually it'll be hard to
02:07:54.559 address it and it won't make sense
02:07:55.760 because adoption rates will be solo and
02:07:57.480 the amount of money you'll have to spend
02:07:59.320 to get those people to come to your app
02:08:01.000 or your landing page and order it's
02:08:03.040 going to be it's going to be trickling
02:08:05.000 can't like a bunch of you get together
02:08:06.599 because you guys have such broad chains
02:08:09.760 and create your own like a Cooperative
02:08:11.760 of restaurants running their own
02:08:13.480 delivery R should address
02:08:17.440 this it's it's going to become
02:08:19.800 increasingly critical that we have a
02:08:22.079 Counterpoint we we are developing and
02:08:25.000 working very
02:08:26.280 closely um with onc now we are going to
02:08:30.400 build channels we are going to start
02:08:31.599 building
02:08:32.480 competencies because um we have nothing
02:08:36.280 against aggregators we appreciate that
02:08:38.760 they have actually helped build a demand
02:08:42.360 right which is not competing with the
02:08:43.559 restaurant business the delivery
02:08:45.360 business is competing with the kitchen
02:08:47.800 is not competing with
02:08:49.440 restaurant but while they've done that
02:08:51.440 they've taken away any hope of margin so
02:08:53.320 we all running just to stay in the same
02:08:55.800 place so we are going to f focus on onc
02:08:59.559 we are going to focus on our own
02:09:00.719 delivery Fleet slowly but slowly we
02:09:02.239 going to develop technology Stacks that
02:09:04.679 going to help us do this better uh and
02:09:07.800 like I said we have nothing against the
02:09:09.199 aggregator but we what we are against is
02:09:11.320 the tyranny of the aggregator where
02:09:13.559 things are unilaterally changed where uh
02:09:16.679 if you don't play by the book you taking
02:09:18.559 off the platform or your your your
02:09:21.119 delivery radius drops or your visibility
02:09:24.079 is there or you're just not available
02:09:25.960 for customers to see and does everybody
02:09:28.199 feel this way across restaurants
02:09:30.199 predominantly majority I do it's it's
02:09:33.119 also interesting because in my office
02:09:34.599 for example right they all these 23 24
02:09:36.599 year olds and they order food everyday
02:09:38.920 lunches coming from zamato origi and
02:09:41.119 it's never about the brand that they've
02:09:43.520 ordered from it's like what's the best
02:09:45.119 deal I got today and that's what the
02:09:48.480 customers now used to theyve made deal
02:09:49.880 Seekers out of customers so it's just
02:09:53.239 it's like an addiction discounting has
02:09:55.639 become an addiction and that's never a
02:09:57.440 good thing whenever you build an entire
02:10:00.079 system based on giving discounts
02:10:02.599 eventually the consumer suffers
02:10:05.320 eventually at the cost of profitability
02:10:07.920 is growth at the cost of profit and also
02:10:10.360 sometimes I feel that the funding of
02:10:12.599 that discount is being done by the
02:10:14.159 restaurant at the cost of the restaurant
02:10:16.840 um so I think that there has to be some
02:10:18.880 kind of dialogue that needs to increase
02:10:21.639 and I think that's happening I think
02:10:22.679 both sides are willing to talk and leaz
02:10:24.760 with each other positive proactive man
02:10:27.199 um worldwide you've seen this happen
02:10:29.520 where eventually it becomes an ecosystem
02:10:31.000 that's a win-win so let's hope for that
02:10:33.199 but if they're not able to be profitable
02:10:34.960 at their current
02:10:36.719 margins how will they be at one3 I'm
02:10:39.480 maybe they should stop buying rubbish
02:10:44.239 companies if I were to be an investor in
02:10:46.719 zamato which is a publicly list
02:10:50.679 stock should this make me
02:10:53.960 worried if all restaurants are thinking
02:10:56.360 this way including our pastry chef it's
02:10:58.559 going to take some time they have
02:10:59.840 adjusted a bit us too and which is good
02:11:03.480 I think see look they definitely are a a
02:11:08.800 duopoly right this is definitely a
02:11:10.880 growing
02:11:12.480 market and what they have seen is that
02:11:14.800 for every 5,000 restaurants that come
02:11:17.599 off their plat from every week they get
02:11:20.199 another 6,000 restaurants coming in
02:11:21.800 their state they don't care they
02:11:24.920 agnostic to the faith of the restaurant
02:11:27.719 they are only building the the habit
02:11:32.320 forming activity they are building the
02:11:34.719 the use case which is great the problem
02:11:37.719 is that what is happening to those guys
02:11:39.480 who are putting up the Investments or
02:11:40.800 quitting their jobs taking all their
02:11:42.920 life savings and putting that into uh a
02:11:46.360 business because it's a business that
02:11:47.639 you can acheve
02:11:48.840 bus set
02:11:49.760 up the average guy who set up a kitchen
02:11:53.239 with you know who's getting into the
02:11:54.360 restaurant industry the first time
02:11:55.760 entrepreneur doesn't have the
02:11:57.480 sophisticated marketing techniques where
02:11:59.239 he can push those products out he is
02:12:01.760 completely dependent on visibility that
02:12:03.719 comes from the from those platforms but
02:12:07.079 the system will go on the discounting
02:12:08.559 will go on I don't have a very distopian
02:12:11.119 view of the future I think in the future
02:12:13.400 there will be some form of um coherence
02:12:16.000 and rationality being built in that
02:12:18.559 would mean both parties would need to
02:12:20.400 address situations I really think that
02:12:22.719 commissions need to be addressed and I
02:12:25.000 really think that data sharing should
02:12:27.400 become uh something that H starts
02:12:29.679 happening important don't share any data
02:12:31.360 now uh not customer data there's enough
02:12:33.880 data being shared let me just be I order
02:12:35.719 from say a masala library and I get the
02:12:39.520 food I order via spigg orato or any
02:12:41.639 other agregator you don't know who Ed I
02:12:44.760 don't know who you are and obviously
02:12:47.480 there are ways you you can put a little
02:12:48.559 pamphlet that if you have a problem call
02:12:49.920 us and all that but that doesn't really
02:12:50.960 work and but they wouldn't like that
02:12:52.320 right they actively go through your your
02:12:56.040 packages and remove any such literature
02:12:58.400 the problem is the consumer will still
02:13:00.360 choose to go on zamato or Swig and order
02:13:02.079 from you that's the problem and it's not
02:13:05.079 necess problem it's a convenience issue
02:13:07.119 if I have an account like I have SW and
02:13:08.880 zamato on my account to be honest and
02:13:10.719 I'm in the delivery business extensively
02:13:12.880 but I have not built my feet and Fleet
02:13:14.559 and I don't really intend to build it
02:13:16.159 immediately till I have uh sense that
02:13:19.000 this money can be recovered um I just
02:13:21.920 think it has to become more of a win-win
02:13:24.760 and a hand in glove scenario where we're
02:13:26.760 not against each other we're working
02:13:28.320 with each other but you want to build
02:13:31.360 the fleet individually when you can get
02:13:34.520 exactly a cluster Fleet that's exactly
02:13:36.800 my point you mean when we get together
02:13:38.320 some of us get together you would want R
02:13:40.000 you would want Puja you would want like
02:13:41.599 100 others if absolutely I think that I
02:13:43.760 think that's an alternative Thrive uh I
02:13:46.679 use pay uh but yeah Thrive is another
02:13:49.520 good mechanism and you can do have
02:13:51.840 pinging services from you know a
02:13:54.559 plethora of people which will tell you
02:13:56.480 where to go how to go you can even give
02:13:58.040 tracking Services it's all available
02:14:00.440 what is happening but the discovery
02:14:01.880 element sorry is better on these
02:14:05.480 platforms right when you know when you
02:14:08.040 have the Loyalty when you know exactly
02:14:09.760 what you want there is a use case to go
02:14:12.239 to your you know your app because now
02:14:14.159 you can do it on WhatsApp youve got
02:14:15.559 catalogs available you can call if you
02:14:17.920 you don't want the hassle you want the
02:14:18.920 convenience all that data stack is
02:14:20.960 available to you on various platform but
02:14:24.079 the discovery component and the the
02:14:26.360 discounting component that
02:14:29.320 is the catnip that people are coming
02:14:31.719 back for but how can they ever discount
02:14:33.639 in a manner that you the originator of
02:14:35.679 the product can discount they can never
02:14:37.360 compete with that right like if you
02:14:39.520 built a platform yourself to deliver
02:14:42.760 your cost price is 30 you can sell it 30
02:14:45.760 but aggregator can never discount as
02:14:47.599 much as right it's taken years of of
02:14:50.599 taking hits on the bottom line and being
02:14:54.280 and sustaining that to be able to get to
02:14:57.320 that critical mass where now your
02:14:59.400 delivery guy is is is you know that his
02:15:01.599 salary is paying for and paying for more
02:15:04.599 this is basically a fixed cost
02:15:06.800 versus uh a variable cost model Right
02:15:09.639 restaurant does don't have those Deep
02:15:11.199 Pockets don't even have those margins
02:15:13.400 where they can afford to pay for those
02:15:14.719 things so it is a little bit of a loop
02:15:17.280 but event I think that there will there
02:15:19.639 will be
02:15:21.199 some way out of this is that the same
02:15:23.840 for you Puja with desserts and mu
02:15:27.040 muffins and macaroons and everything I
02:15:29.199 mean the the good thing is we have
02:15:30.639 higher margins so what margins do you
02:15:33.360 operate on 18 20% yeah but
02:15:36.599 not 30 18 18 20% is what what name
02:15:41.280 should I make the check out
02:15:44.679 seriously that's pretty good yeah oh
02:15:47.679 that below and that's despite using the
02:15:50.159 best
02:15:51.840 ingredients but now I'm going to take
02:15:53.719 this 300 rupe Macon idea yeah I'm going
02:15:55.920 to do it Go With It gold on it yeah gold
02:15:58.679 put gold on it yeah Qui so is there a
02:16:01.119 tip like if I'm a new restaurer and I'm
02:16:03.840 going to swiy and
02:16:05.360 zamato I know it's ridiculously
02:16:08.079 obnoxiously High the margin for whatever
02:16:10.679 reason Market fundamentals how do I
02:16:16.719 negotiate
02:16:24.679 the only way of doing this is to have a
02:16:26.880 really really strong product tell the
02:16:29.159 aggregators to sit on it like just do
02:16:32.558 your business create a great demand
02:16:35.318 create a great thing they will come to
02:16:36.718 you and they will do it at your price
02:16:39.599 can't you play one the other you can but
02:16:42.920 again if you're an also Rand product if
02:16:46.040 you have a very very solid product M
02:16:48.519 which has great recall which has which
02:16:50.478 has a following which is becoming you
02:16:53.000 know very very trendy people are
02:16:54.679 reaching out and one that you're not on
02:16:56.478 that that's something that they will
02:16:58.718 come to you and say okay we want you
02:17:00.240 exclusively then then you can start
02:17:01.599 playing off actually why can't you tell
02:17:03.398 swiigy I will if you crack a deal with
02:17:05.638 swiy at 15% and tell zomato unless you
02:17:08.240 do 12% I'll only sell on swiy why
02:17:10.439 wouldn't that
02:17:11.879 work I don't I think I think people have
02:17:14.318 tried that and I don't think it was
02:17:15.558 going to work throughout so they've also
02:17:17.000 wisened up to that but I think more
02:17:18.318 importantly do they work together do
02:17:19.920 they collude no they don't what they
02:17:22.040 don't they don't even hire from each
02:17:23.478 other from what I know neither do we we
02:17:25.879 were still better off our relationship
02:17:27.240 is we're not
02:17:28.280 a multi mulopo okay so I think um there
02:17:33.359 are institutions for example you have
02:17:34.679 truffles in Bangalore they can demand
02:17:37.318 whatever uh rates they can because
02:17:39.120 they're an institution they're a
02:17:40.359 legendary restaurant regular burger
02:17:42.679 joint cannot do that one way that I
02:17:45.359 would recommend to people that if
02:17:48.398 they're in a certain geography is that
02:17:50.040 you could go the route of being
02:17:51.879 exclusive if you offer that there is a
02:17:54.120 potential of asking for lower
02:17:57.359 percentages because you're in a way
02:17:59.240 alleviating the um ability of that
02:18:02.439 restaurant to be sold that a brand to be
02:18:04.200 sold on another platform that was one
02:18:06.558 way I don't think you can play people
02:18:08.478 against each other and that's not going
02:18:10.120 to work but I I also think it's it's
02:18:12.840 what what we are doing is also working
02:18:14.398 with swiy to create products which is
02:18:17.638 which is that fill a need yeah cuz they
02:18:19.799 come with come to us and they say okay
02:18:21.240 these are the products that are really
02:18:22.280 working we only have one person
02:18:23.920 instamart especially we only have one
02:18:26.000 person doing this if you can create this
02:18:27.799 I know that I can occupy where there's
02:18:29.359 scarcity where there's a demand Supply
02:18:32.318 yeah imbalance they're really really
02:18:34.200 quick to try and fill up those gaps I've
02:18:36.080 tried the onc app what is it called
02:18:37.840 Magic pin or whatever magic pin that
02:18:39.478 brings your cost down from 20 change per
02:18:41.478 to four five% right what is the issue
02:18:43.519 with it right now so on is definitely a
02:18:45.718 very is a democratization and a
02:18:48.160 commoditization of delivery now here's
02:18:50.558 the beauty there are enough third-party
02:18:52.558 aggregators that can responsibly and
02:18:55.599 effectively take your product from your
02:18:57.760 Cloud kitchen or your restaurant to the
02:18:59.599 end user there are enough of them now
02:19:02.080 they however perhaps are not as seamless
02:19:05.040 because magicpin or PTM who have these
02:19:07.760 seller apps on onc are still relying on
02:19:10.280 these third party people they're not
02:19:11.679 employees of magic pin or employees of
02:19:13.599 PM they're third party delivery people
02:19:16.120 so that extra charges is there but the
02:19:17.840 way to circumvent that is to be able to
02:19:19.920 charge the
02:19:21.280 consumer fee and I think the fee for 3
02:19:23.599 km is 50 rupees so if you're within 3
02:19:26.000 kilm you charge 50 it's a little bit
02:19:27.519 more charge 70 I think people and the
02:19:30.160 advantage is pric are coming down right
02:19:32.718 the cost of delivery is coming down
02:19:34.558 because as we move into
02:19:37.799 electricity right now right now the cost
02:19:40.799 of the actual hardcore Cog okay cogs of
02:19:44.679 delivery is at 22 rupe is it's not it's
02:19:48.318 what 22 R what 22 Rupees is the cost of
02:19:51.439 delivery for what is what you will pay
02:19:54.200 your guy it's your average dist of 5 K
02:19:57.800 22 22 Rupees is your cost per kilometer
02:20:00.520 or what are you saying 22 Rupees is your
02:20:02.600 cost of delivery for that package and
02:20:05.520 come back but there has a distance to it
02:20:07.479 right K if it's 100 km you can't 5 km is
02:20:10.880 22 rupees right your the the problem
02:20:14.880 which is happening is the onc is coming
02:20:16.560 through sell apps and that's only as
02:20:19.000 good as the fact that how magic pin is
02:20:22.240 doing right the point is that onc once
02:20:24.760 we start creating our
02:20:27.000 own on onc and we start working Regional
02:20:31.720 wise where we start sharpening our
02:20:33.640 delivery uh capabilities are what is
02:20:36.680 called online on demand delivery right
02:20:39.000 because that's what these guys have
02:20:40.080 really CED it's on demand delivery dzo
02:20:43.160 is very good shadowfax is very good at
02:20:45.359 delivery last mile delivery but not
02:20:47.800 necessarily on demand the trick is to
02:20:50.319 get the meal into their hands in 15
02:20:53.520 minutes or less after it leaves from the
02:20:55.280 kitchen has to be able to get to that
02:20:57.200 person but that will happen with scale
02:20:59.160 right incredible Innovation though right
02:21:01.760 it's beautiful it's a democratization
02:21:03.680 yeah the beauty of the Indian Tex tack
02:21:06.120 is just amazing it is it is fascinating
02:21:09.000 I think he's a friend of mine nand who's
02:21:11.040 kind of like worked around a lot of
02:21:13.359 these CTO of India incredible CTO of
02:21:16.319 India literally incredible human being
02:21:18.640 yeah and ALS also like keeps the
02:21:21.920 ecosystem together adhar was also his
02:21:24.240 adhar was his brainchild so he has a
02:21:26.160 dinner once in a month at home and he
02:21:28.200 makes sure we all catch up and it's an
02:21:31.560 he's a he's a he's a
02:21:33.640 true Indian yeah he's a true guy who
02:21:36.640 cares about this country about you know
02:21:40.920 about making this country more
02:21:43.520 technically Savvy and a world leader and
02:21:45.840 his wife like very few people know know
02:21:47.399 rohini but she does so much work in
02:21:50.520 climate and water and Incredibly driven
02:21:54.439 couple and their daughter and their like
02:21:57.319 entire family okay uh Cloud kitchens do
02:22:00.760 they work R had a very strong totally
02:22:03.720 different so but that's interesting yeah
02:22:06.080 Cloud kitens work for where either you
02:22:10.439 are a very strong brand that you've
02:22:12.840 built over the years you come from a
02:22:15.399 certain pedigree and have have the
02:22:17.840 sophistication enough to understand
02:22:20.600 sophisticated marketing tools and CRM
02:22:23.479 and and to be data driven and
02:22:25.439 analytic it's very very difficult for
02:22:29.359 the average what you think mortality
02:22:31.720 rates in the restaurant businesses are
02:22:33.439 high the mortality rates in the cloud G
02:22:36.200 business are are twice as high because
02:22:38.960 you the data which we've seen I said so
02:22:41.720 we actually 5,000 restaurants a month
02:22:45.640 wow are going off platforms
02:22:47.800 that's 5,000 Broken Dreams every month
02:22:50.040 wow right and they're just going because
02:22:52.160 they cannot man because how will you
02:22:53.840 manage with 55% of your margin is been
02:22:56.720 taken by some I don't think it's 55% I
02:22:58.280 think the numbers are not there push
02:22:59.560 come to shove things things stay as they
02:23:01.800 are today will you build your own Fleet
02:23:04.439 will you have to build your own Fleet I
02:23:06.560 think it's good to have a good balance I
02:23:09.200 definitely would like a scenario where
02:23:11.880 um 25 to 30% of our delivery orders are
02:23:15.880 done directly from a data perspective I
02:23:18.800 want to have a direct contact with my
02:23:20.120 consumer and get feedback more closely I
02:23:23.319 think that's the sweet spot for
02:23:25.240 mehm so top top dishes chart Biryani
02:23:30.200 sweets or top Cuisines Chinese Indian do
02:23:34.640 you think the odds of success are higher
02:23:36.840 building here or building something new
02:23:40.000 alog together as a new person starting a
02:23:43.720 restaurant pedigree always helps no ped
02:23:47.240 saying that I'm a new guy I've saved up
02:23:49.760 a little bit of money I was working in a
02:23:51.880 job Last 5 Years should I hit North
02:23:55.680 Indian Chinese South Indian or chart
02:23:58.960 chicken biryani sweet from a popularity
02:24:01.319 perspective from from a success odds of
02:24:03.200 success perspect here's the the
02:24:05.439 double-edged sword here I think is that
02:24:07.880 though Cuisines like North Indian and
02:24:09.479 Biryani might be more popular than S
02:24:11.120 burger and pizza pizzas are now equally
02:24:13.160 popular the problem also remains that
02:24:15.439 there's a lot more competition a lot
02:24:17.479 more players in these fields so it's
02:24:21.000 hard to say we've seen for example a
02:24:24.240 tougher challenge selling pizzas than
02:24:27.080 Burgers whereas the demand for pizzas is
02:24:29.520 far more than burgers in India it's like
02:24:31.479 literally like our dinner and our snack
02:24:33.080 and our lunch Pizza has reached that
02:24:36.160 there are fewer burger places and as a
02:24:38.600 result if you can make a difference make
02:24:40.560 a better product you can stand out and
02:24:42.960 the competition is lower Supply is lower
02:24:45.120 of rest from the restaurant side whereas
02:24:47.279 in pizzas you're competing with the big
02:24:48.960 boys and although you know Domino's is
02:24:52.080 is the biggest of them all you have
02:24:53.479 Burger King and you have McDonald's but
02:24:55.720 I just think that it's not just the
02:24:58.040 cuisine itself it's also how many people
02:24:59.960 are playing that game at that time it's
02:25:03.000 a it's a demand Supply game depending on
02:25:05.359 which region you're operating in there's
02:25:07.279 certain there are certain areas where
02:25:09.200 there's a certain demand so like for
02:25:10.640 example Mexican is not sought after m in
02:25:14.560 all
02:25:15.880 regions no I'm it's fair like you know
02:25:18.680 there there's there are some areas where
02:25:21.040 you know the there will be no demand for
02:25:24.319 uh 800 rupe burger and there's some
02:25:26.600 demand where the demand for 800 rupe
02:25:28.920 Burger will out strip that so it is
02:25:31.760 strategic you have I can't give you one
02:25:33.840 answer for the whole Market it depends
02:25:36.160 on which Market you're thinking about
02:25:37.720 operating in that's why you got to see
02:25:39.439 what is being underserved and what if
02:25:41.880 you're thinking about scale it's a
02:25:43.680 different issue but if you're starting
02:25:44.920 off I think you're very well placed by
02:25:46.920 by finding out what what is the demand
02:25:49.279 and uh the aggregators are very happy to
02:25:51.600 share this information with you you can
02:25:53.479 go to them and you can ask them Hey
02:25:55.319 listen where are you seeing a demand
02:25:57.560 Supply mismatch what is an area a gap
02:26:00.399 that we can help fulfill right and and
02:26:03.760 uh they will very happily give you that
02:26:06.160 data and if you're willing to play that
02:26:07.920 game then yes you you do have a
02:26:09.800 reasonable chance of I think for me when
02:26:11.880 I started I asked myself a very simple
02:26:13.760 question and I just said I don't want to
02:26:16.200 have anything on my menu that's
02:26:17.479 available everywhere and for me that was
02:26:20.279 a differentiation at that time and I
02:26:22.279 think it worked also cuz it's a
02:26:24.080 different Market it's a different
02:26:25.359 premium level um but yeah if you do
02:26:28.600 something that everybody is doing then
02:26:30.120 the competition is obviously a lot more
02:26:32.120 you won't be specifically to answer your
02:26:34.600 question I think it's not about the
02:26:35.680 cuisine it's about which Market which
02:26:37.439 geography are you serving what for
02:26:39.000 example it might be easy to serve butter
02:26:41.600 chicken in in in in Bangalore than
02:26:44.399 Biryani even though Biryani is more
02:26:46.240 popular best taken from the aggregators
02:26:49.560 and do they give it just like that for
02:26:50.920 free share because they want to build
02:26:52.720 the ecosystem so that's one data that
02:26:55.080 you're never going to have a problem
02:26:57.240 getting they will not give you data of
02:26:59.840 the customer because they want to keep
02:27:01.279 the the funnel to themselves right but
02:27:04.479 and and uh they will site security
02:27:06.880 reasons of course for that but that data
02:27:10.279 is not but any other data where there's
02:27:12.040 a kind of a mismatch or what is being
02:27:14.720 ordered that is freely available so if
02:27:16.840 you go and you ask
02:27:21.960 them is avilable with and that could be
02:27:24.319 used as a tool for new people
02:27:26.439 right it's Burger man it's quite
02:27:32.080 nied I don't know lamb that looks like
02:27:35.080 lamb do you want to try that what is
02:27:37.600 this sadar where's the chicken there
02:27:39.640 must be some chicken burgers also
02:27:43.760 guys fried chicken burger cold is not
02:27:46.000 going to work
02:27:50.080 coffee supply chain am I missing
02:27:52.279 anything is there a way to negotiate
02:27:54.399 efficiencies in the supply chain to
02:27:56.760 reduce the cost of goods where do you
02:27:59.040 buy supplies from as a restaurant
02:28:01.279 owner multiple vendors all of us rely on
02:28:05.080 mult hyperpure has been started by
02:28:06.720 zamato that is trying to you know become
02:28:09.399 a platform but at this point in time the
02:28:12.000 vast majority of restaurants around the
02:28:14.279 country are buying from Individual
02:28:15.680 vendors that they've had relationships
02:28:17.560 for years and it's a good thing you
02:28:20.279 should encourage this local farmer local
02:28:23.640 vendor these guys the meat supplier the
02:28:25.680 local butcher the local farmer the local
02:28:28.479 vegetable guy even though he's a
02:28:29.760 consolidator you know and goes to the
02:28:31.560 MonDay every morning picks up the stuff
02:28:33.240 does that effort does that value add and
02:28:34.640 then gives it to you I think that should
02:28:36.520 be supported but there are now
02:28:37.479 Alternatives there are now larger
02:28:38.960 platforms like hyperpure that are
02:28:40.880 providing
02:28:42.120 a platform and you Puja we also use
02:28:45.800 hyper now for our basic groceries and
02:28:47.960 then we have why is that is it quality
02:28:49.680 is it cost why
02:28:51.880 convenience single vendor for many
02:28:54.240 things do you get credit yeah you get
02:28:58.640 yes but not a lot but you get better
02:29:01.319 credit from the individual vendors and
02:29:03.920 also remember there's a relationship
02:29:05.160 thing I think there's one hand you're
02:29:06.399 saying support the local guys and the
02:29:08.160 other
02:29:09.200 hand what percentage wait small
02:29:12.240 percentage like a fraction how much a
02:29:14.720 fraction okay fraction is in single
02:29:16.880 digits percentage support the local gu I
02:29:19.880 do I love the local guy in fact I think
02:29:22.800 that I have more of a relationship with
02:29:25.279 the local guy far more than anybody then
02:29:28.479 then I would get with a with a large
02:29:29.920 platform again I don't want to get
02:29:31.640 dependent also on one large player right
02:29:33.720 I want to have my you know these these
02:29:35.640 people for example the the red me the
02:29:37.479 goat that I get in for the NCR region
02:29:39.600 comes from one small butcher who used to
02:29:41.359 First Supply to my house I helped him
02:29:43.319 build capacity I actually said listen
02:29:45.640 I'm guaranteeing you this much purchase
02:29:47.120 can you please start producing more for
02:29:49.040 me and he built the system where now
02:29:50.800 he's actually supplying to
02:29:54.439 others main points one needs to keep in
02:29:57.000 mind while opening a restaurant one big
02:29:59.680 question location how do you guys narrow
02:30:02.600 down on location because you've all said
02:30:05.200 location location location how do you
02:30:07.399 what do you use individually to figure
02:30:09.399 out the location I think all of us will
02:30:11.520 have some similar points and some
02:30:13.840 overlaps um I I'm a little bit old
02:30:17.720 school in this sense when it comes to a
02:30:21.000 restaurant location a physical offline
02:30:23.800 restaurant location I would like to
02:30:26.200 visit at least once or multiple times if
02:30:28.600 possible and go with the gut I do rely
02:30:31.720 on data but like I said the data is
02:30:34.319 fairly uh you know it's it's not really
02:30:36.960 that accurate and might be stale it
02:30:38.520 might be stale data that you're getting
02:30:39.640 from these agencies you should go and
02:30:42.840 see other restaurants in the area in
02:30:45.640 other restaurants absolutely that's
02:30:47.600 that's what that's how you do a site
02:30:48.760 survey site survey is a two-day exercise
02:30:51.560 it's not usually a one because you're
02:30:52.920 going to invest 5 six 2 three 5 six CR
02:30:56.200 rupees into a restaurant you should at
02:30:57.840 least give it two days makes logical
02:30:59.960 sense sit there put the time in and I
02:31:03.439 don't think even though I have a great
02:31:05.160 business development team and people I
02:31:06.760 really trust uh and and and and
02:31:09.680 sometimes especially for overseas
02:31:10.840 locations I'm not able to visit I think
02:31:13.160 it's important if you especially if
02:31:15.800 you're starting out to spend that time
02:31:18.040 to go and focus on that for us for me at
02:31:20.640 least for Bombay it's been cuz I know
02:31:22.479 the city I kind of know um the pulse of
02:31:25.359 it I know where the product will really
02:31:27.080 sell but what we've been doing recently
02:31:29.120 is actually using the cloud kitchen
02:31:30.600 model to kind of understand uh a
02:31:32.840 neighborhood so for example we started a
02:31:35.880 cloud Kitchen in juu for 6 months and we
02:31:38.479 saw that that was really successful and
02:31:40.040 we said okay this Market is successful
02:31:41.479 let's open a store here and we opened a
02:31:43.439 store there so we kind of using that and
02:31:45.399 seeing okay we're do now that's a very
02:31:47.720 good way of doward we're doing Tani now
02:31:50.160 and we're saying okay Tani is doing well
02:31:51.439 for us Malad didn't do that well for us
02:31:54.040 so we're kind of testing the kex of a
02:31:55.600 cloud kitchen is significantly lower
02:31:57.359 it's lower it's it's it's it's nothing
02:31:59.279 fraction fraction yeah we're working
02:32:01.520 with uh an existing Cloud kitchen so we
02:32:03.359 just Supply Goods there so then it's and
02:32:05.479 they do do the Fulfillment they do
02:32:08.000 supply chain is control not seems like a
02:32:10.040 great hack Supply to an existing croud
02:32:13.200 yeah the Bell is entirely on that yeah
02:32:16.040 real
02:32:17.399 well you know I think uh location uh is
02:32:20.439 also a function of product depending on
02:32:23.000 what kind of product you want to offer
02:32:24.600 so that becomes very important if you
02:32:26.680 are if you are a qsr business you of
02:32:29.439 course want to be in a fast moving you
02:32:31.279 know audience you want to be able to
02:32:33.640 capitalize on foot on footfall not just
02:32:36.760 uh I'm talking about walking footall not
02:32:38.880 not driving footall because that doesn't
02:32:40.520 really help
02:32:41.560 us uh if you're slightly more
02:32:44.000 sophisticated food how do you count
02:32:45.399 foood for
02:32:46.800 well what do you mean like if you're
02:32:48.319 picking a location and you want to know
02:32:49.960 what is the footfall of people just
02:32:51.479 passing by that place how do you count
02:32:54.000 so I mean we get our data points like
02:32:56.359 from various agencies that that yeah J
02:33:01.319 agencies localers there are local
02:33:03.840 Brokers and uh a lot of the information
02:33:08.040 that restaurant us get and how does some
02:33:10.359 this information from J they email them
02:33:12.800 143
02:33:14.319 loc bomb Central
02:33:16.250 [Music]
02:33:17.439 there everybody knows
02:33:19.279 everybody we
02:33:22.240 know this is the this restaurant is
02:33:24.560 doing this restaurant is doing it's
02:33:26.080 anecdotally available this information
02:33:27.880 is largely on one particular train why
02:33:29.920 no because this is where the crowds
02:33:31.399 mingle this is where all the hospitality
02:33:33.359 guys go back this is where the
02:33:35.319 information comes in they talk to each
02:33:36.880 other there's a loose connection there's
02:33:39.000 some guy who's working for my restaurant
02:33:40.920 has worked with somebody else and
02:33:43.000 somebody else's restaurant there's
02:33:44.120 always a network so there's always a Lo
02:33:46.319 sharing of information going on about
02:33:47.920 how much business you know this one
02:33:50.479 everybody
02:33:56.000 knows everybody knows that in the
02:33:58.040 industry so there's another form of
02:34:00.240 triangulation another form of
02:34:01.800 triangulation is to basically figure out
02:34:04.479 from your suppliers how much you know
02:34:07.120 which restaurants are buying which
02:34:09.040 regions where they're supplying more
02:34:10.479 your liquor companies these are again uh
02:34:13.279 Rich data sources aggregators again data
02:34:16.520 sources so these are all different data
02:34:18.560 sources that are available to you and
02:34:20.000 depending on what your product is and
02:34:22.319 what kind of what kind of price points
02:34:24.399 Etc um that is again available the
02:34:27.000 demographic breakup is also available so
02:34:29.120 you can decide no very interesting based
02:34:30.760 on that all three points very
02:34:32.200 interesting how do you account for
02:34:33.960 pillage in accounting and how do you
02:34:35.720 prevent that from happening CU if I'm
02:34:38.279 new and starting a restaurant that that
02:34:40.000 could be a big issue right it is it is
02:34:43.560 unfortunately it's a reality and um you
02:34:46.439 have to learn to ignore some of it but
02:34:47.840 you have to have systems see this is a
02:34:50.000 very this is a very high touch Point
02:34:52.880 industry there are many moving
02:34:55.840 parts and as a result even though
02:34:59.000 barriers to entry are low you don't need
02:35:00.840 a diploma to open a restaurant the
02:35:03.000 dependence on systems is arguably even
02:35:05.080 higher than perhaps if you're making a
02:35:06.399 ball bearing Factory you're buying from
02:35:08.600 one vendor you're producing in one
02:35:09.920 machine you know not too many people
02:35:11.439 here there are so many gaps the
02:35:12.680 bartender is one so what hacks do you
02:35:14.840 use what do you do I don't think there
02:35:16.439 are any hacks I think there's a lot of
02:35:18.359 like I said building you never out sour
02:35:20.240 Supply like paying the supplier ordering
02:35:23.000 all of that in in so overseas we do that
02:35:25.720 uh the entire accounting for example in
02:35:27.319 fzy Cafe London is outsourced because we
02:35:29.680 don't for one restaurant not going to
02:35:30.800 build a whole finance department in
02:35:32.560 India we do it fully
02:35:34.200 internalized um you have to have systems
02:35:37.000 you I cannot downplay the importance of
02:35:39.640 you know like I said it's it is low
02:35:42.760 barrier to entry but there are just so
02:35:44.800 many gaps you have to have dependence on
02:35:47.240 good people build good C good culture
02:35:49.680 perhaps develop a direct relationship
02:35:51.120 with your vendors so when I say pill
02:35:52.840 fridge I mean you're I assuming you're
02:35:54.439 saying consumer comes and bills not
02:35:56.359 raised or the vendor is supplying 10 and
02:35:59.080 you're being charged for 12 right
02:36:01.240 culture building um making sure there
02:36:03.520 enough audits we we we do a bunch of
02:36:06.000 audits but I think it's more important
02:36:07.359 you just have to learn you can't police
02:36:08.680 people for too long can you remote
02:36:10.279 control a restaurant can you not be
02:36:12.640 physically at that particular branch and
02:36:14.600 check for all this
02:36:18.000 yeah I mean how is what what are your
02:36:20.479 methods of accounting and so basically
02:36:26.120 um opening
02:36:28.160 stock less purchases closing stock is
02:36:31.319 basic accounting but what you follow is
02:36:34.880 standard recipes which are fed into your
02:36:37.120 point of Sal system your your inventory
02:36:39.439 management system needs to be linked
02:36:40.880 with a point of sale system from from
02:36:43.399 your sale of today if I've sold let's
02:36:46.359 say in a month I've sold 300 coffees
02:36:48.920 it's very easy to calculate what my
02:36:50.520 consumption of coffee should have been
02:36:51.920 what my consumption of milk should have
02:36:53.200 been what my consumption of sugar shab
02:36:54.960 be you know and you get a little
02:36:56.840 tolerance levels but but it's very very
02:36:59.359 easy to tell that you have to be able to
02:37:01.600 be very diligent in your Audits and
02:37:04.760 stopke keeping right your bar inventory
02:37:06.960 needs to be tallied every night you
02:37:08.760 cannot afford to not do it your your
02:37:11.840 your inventories need to be closed on
02:37:13.680 the 31st of every month means they need
02:37:15.600 to be closed on the whatever happens
02:37:18.000 Come Rain or high water it needs to be
02:37:19.560 closed your stocks need to be your first
02:37:21.600 in first out methods need to be followed
02:37:23.479 they need to be followed barcoding needs
02:37:25.160 to happen it needs to happen so there
02:37:26.800 are there's various technology Stacks
02:37:28.640 which are available right now is there a
02:37:30.640 particular software you can buy that
02:37:32.040 helps you do
02:37:33.680 this what do what do you guys use we
02:37:36.840 have so we have a system called Rista
02:37:40.000 just past I use to and we use them for
02:37:43.800 postem spell that how do you spell
02:37:46.520 St K andpay runs it good system it's a
02:37:51.040 new one but it's fairly robust and we
02:37:52.960 also use the Erp system so in different
02:37:55.720 kind of restaurants you need different
02:37:56.960 kind of systems like I said if you don't
02:37:58.680 have Sops you're dead in the water
02:38:00.560 because there are so many gaps right and
02:38:02.160 there are so many touch points uh for
02:38:04.439 Rista the Erp system is they also have
02:38:06.920 an Erp but you don't need a sap you
02:38:09.760 don't need a sap a basic material
02:38:11.680 management system and that's linked to
02:38:13.640 your POS and that can then identify
02:38:16.560 consumption and you tally that with the
02:38:18.600 sale one key thing in liquor based
02:38:21.399 restaurants such as socials or fzy cafes
02:38:23.600 with that have a high liquor component
02:38:25.680 we at our company do a daily inventory
02:38:29.240 of every single bottle of liquor every
02:38:32.200 night and we have a weekly food cost
02:38:34.960 report so every week we have a full food
02:38:37.720 cost report opening closing
02:38:40.439 consumption with a running like a
02:38:43.240 realtime food cost and COG report what
02:38:46.560 that does is it helps us track if there
02:38:49.000 are anomalies and the anomalies can be
02:38:51.319 addressed timely if you do it twice a
02:38:53.520 month half the month is over you found
02:38:55.359 out to adjust it takes another week and
02:38:57.640 then you're already late your food cost
02:38:59.439 is are going to jump your beverage cost
02:39:00.760 is going to jump so I think use the
02:39:03.880 technology it's there for all the young
02:39:05.680 people watching who want to get into
02:39:06.880 this use the technology it's there it's
02:39:08.720 cheap it's not expensive and it's easy
02:39:11.120 to learn and there's enough how much
02:39:13.279 does it cost I don't know the exact
02:39:15.120 numbers but it's in literally a few
02:39:16.680 thousands per restaurant per month a few
02:39:19.240 thousands a a full um stack point of
02:39:23.359 sale and inventory management system
02:39:25.920 should Cost You Less Than A lakh a year
02:39:28.840 yeah few thousand per restaurant per
02:39:30.560 month any hacks we use a system called
02:39:32.760 barometer which is our material
02:39:34.200 management system same thing like it's
02:39:36.760 it's it's far easier for us because
02:39:38.560 recipes are so specific as compared to
02:39:40.600 alcohol yours is even better because all
02:39:42.840 chemistry so 100 G of butter will always
02:39:45.120 be 100 G but so we we use barometer and
02:39:48.520 it's it's the same thing it's linked to
02:39:50.279 your POS and then you tally it at the
02:39:52.840 end of the day and one day your C is 18%
02:39:56.120 I remember I remember reading a book
02:39:58.000 about designing a menu long ago and I
02:40:01.200 realized then I don't remember it now
02:40:03.080 but designing the menu is an entire
02:40:05.560 science right like you have a anchoring
02:40:07.680 bias you price dishes you want to sell
02:40:11.840 in a different section ascending or
02:40:13.680 descending you put prizes in a different
02:40:15.600 different manner what is the science of
02:40:17.880 Designing a menu and some hacks that
02:40:20.840 could work in improve sales
02:40:25.399 realas um a magician never reveals no
02:40:28.520 okay
02:40:30.200 uh um look I mean you could you could
02:40:33.640 put in various you know NLP hacks in
02:40:36.560 into those things and you could come up
02:40:38.319 with a lot of that I think what the
02:40:40.840 basic systems are what is called menu
02:40:42.600 engineering where you basically figure
02:40:44.319 out what are the things things that are
02:40:46.200 your stars which means that they they're
02:40:47.960 moving fast and you're getting a decent
02:40:50.160 margin which is acceptable what are your
02:40:52.000 dogs right which are where there are no
02:40:54.880 margins and there no sales what are your
02:40:58.040 workhorses means that you're getting
02:40:59.560 enough volume but they're little lower
02:41:01.560 on on profitability and how do you
02:41:03.080 position the menu in a manner that what
02:41:04.960 you want to sell sales Moree again uh
02:41:07.960 you you put you know you put your
02:41:10.040 there's anchoring bias where you place
02:41:12.200 your uh you know menu which is
02:41:14.720 highlighted which is not highlighted now
02:41:17.080 in addition to uh printed menus now we
02:41:20.160 are increasingly having to become very
02:41:22.479 Savvy about digital menus so you know we
02:41:25.560 have to use the same um cataloging
02:41:28.200 thingss that are happening so even
02:41:29.600 within restaurants now we are not giving
02:41:31.760 customers physical menus we we're
02:41:33.920 encouraging them to order I don't like
02:41:35.560 that to I love physical menus man yeah
02:41:38.040 so do I because I can't I can't get we
02:41:40.479 we've stopped digital everywhere but the
02:41:42.279 Millennials and the genzies they they
02:41:45.439 the shutting out economy Champions they
02:41:48.080 don't want uh to to look this is not
02:41:51.600 true I'm a millennial I can say that but
02:41:53.760 see what we're seeing on the ground
02:41:55.279 level is that we're more than happy and
02:41:57.840 we've seen actually we've seen higher
02:41:59.680 aovs on digital menus that we seeing in
02:42:02.760 printed
02:42:03.640 men also the menu very interesting for
02:42:06.040 me and your menu design so our menu so
02:42:08.840 firstly let me address menu design in
02:42:10.359 general I think you have to look at it
02:42:12.080 in two different ways one is casual
02:42:14.200 dining restaurants like most of us here
02:42:16.640 are are involved in and then there is
02:42:18.880 the qsr the qsr is actually a science
02:42:21.319 where they realize where the cashier is
02:42:23.200 standing the TV screen above him is the
02:42:25.640 first one to get the eyeballs so he's
02:42:27.520 the most expensive or the combos will be
02:42:29.800 there the burger the single burger which
02:42:31.880 is the lowest value adding product for
02:42:33.520 them is literally stuck in the right
02:42:35.319 corner there's a literal book written on
02:42:37.720 how McDonald's developed this system of
02:42:40.399 human psychology you working with
02:42:41.840 psychologists to figure out where should
02:42:44.000 they display what in order to enhance
02:42:45.600 aov because they're working on smaller
02:42:47.560 aovs I think in a my father has spent a
02:42:50.960 lot of time building this he always
02:42:53.040 believed in starting with being India
02:42:55.680 the vegetarian section first and going
02:42:58.040 in an ascending order so lowest to
02:43:02.160 highest so the most expensive product is
02:43:04.600 at the bottom of that particular section
02:43:07.200 simply
02:43:08.840 because when people read the menu you
02:43:11.120 don't want to see a 2,000 rupee dish
02:43:13.359 straight at the top you're immediately
02:43:14.760 turned off this restaurant is too
02:43:16.120 expensive let opposite of the
02:43:17.760 anchoring bi you're talking correct but
02:43:20.080 in a in a restaurant in a casual dining
02:43:22.920 or a fine dining restaurant it has to
02:43:24.600 work the other way but that's assuming
02:43:25.880 you scan the menu once yeah yeah no if
02:43:28.479 you can scan if you're always going to
02:43:30.000 scan the menu a couple of times before
02:43:31.800 you make up your mind your anchor can be
02:43:34.080 downstairs as well yeah that's true and
02:43:36.160 and again like I said qsr and CDR and
02:43:38.399 FDR are three different things so when
02:43:41.359 you're going to a restaurant like a
02:43:42.760 Indian accent or a or you know one of
02:43:45.560 his saltwater grills or premium
02:43:47.600 restaurants you're going to see uh a
02:43:50.319 different kind of consumer not
02:43:51.720 necessarily entirely is the is the
02:43:54.160 purchase decision based on price and
02:43:56.800 vegetarianism why I do that is because I
02:43:59.000 feel that this one country and again I'm
02:44:01.240 talking about Indian restaurants in
02:44:02.359 general I'm not necessarily talking
02:44:03.439 about like uh you know an Asian
02:44:05.319 restaurant or Italian restaurant um when
02:44:08.399 you go as a family it's just more
02:44:11.240 comforting to see a Dal MC or a pan MC
02:44:13.600 or something like that because 45 % of
02:44:15.680 all consumers that come to my
02:44:16.720 restaurants are naturally vegetarian
02:44:18.840 which why is that I I read 80% 79% of
02:44:22.080 India is non-vegetarian it is it is I
02:44:23.880 don't know the number is that high I
02:44:25.319 don't if the number is that most of sou
02:44:27.160 indan PAB is 49% vegetarian guab is the
02:44:31.319 highest highest vegetariana is the
02:44:32.880 highest no Punjab really 49% and you
02:44:35.920 won't believe Arana I thought the number
02:44:37.319 is 65% or something vegetarian I don't
02:44:40.319 know I i' I've read numbers that are 49%
02:44:43.520 for Punjab being number the most and the
02:44:45.800 most nonvegetarian is Kerala Goa West
02:44:49.680 Bengal you know Kaka Tamil NAD Dial line
02:44:53.240 that's running across India it's not
02:44:54.600 it's not a it's not a horizontal line
02:44:56.880 from the Northeast to to Goa in that
02:45:00.000 sense there's a diagonal line and I
02:45:02.240 think you know south and east is more is
02:45:07.520 nonvegetarian rice consuming and north
02:45:11.880 and and West tends to be a little bit
02:45:13.439 more vegge bread basket and that
02:45:17.439 comes for me it's more about how the
02:45:19.720 display fridge looks MH um that's what
02:45:22.680 works for us so it's you eat with your
02:45:24.359 eyes first where you position what um do
02:45:28.319 you do also do smell cuz a lot of new
02:45:30.640 age coffee shops are doing that do that
02:45:32.319 yeah I mean that's how Cinnabon like
02:45:34.160 yeah you know they perfume outside the
02:45:36.960 studio that Cinnabon smell in any and
02:45:40.560 the McDonald's french fries smell Yeah
02:45:43.399 we actually have an experimented with
02:45:44.760 smell but that's a great idea as well so
02:45:46.439 I'm taking away the 300 rupee macaron
02:45:48.960 and adding smell great yeah and who do
02:45:52.200 you guys use for menu
02:45:53.840 designing we do it fully internally 100%
02:45:57.040 internally we have an agency that we
02:45:58.560 work with who do you use there an agency
02:46:00.200 called starting Monday starting Monday
02:46:02.560 yeah and we see we trying to do
02:46:05.640 everything that can help a guy starting
02:46:07.840 a restaurant right H who do you use
02:46:11.640 yeah through ch ch is it doing a good
02:46:15.479 job that's a good segue actually is a
02:46:18.000 helping you guys in any way many way
02:46:20.439 helping us in in many ways develop
02:46:23.120 dishes uh yeah actually wow I mean if
02:46:28.319 you if you have a concept so the way we
02:46:30.520 work with chefs right we we I mean and
02:46:34.040 we kind of together kind of you know
02:46:36.600 okay uh let's make a menu with on
02:46:39.399 grammar right can you make an
02:46:41.439 alliteration can you make a metaphor can
02:46:43.760 you make an oxyon
02:46:45.760 or uh can you make a menu on bandra or
02:46:48.520 can you make uh thing like that so when
02:46:50.399 you we are basically conceptualizing and
02:46:52.120 this is a really good excise that we
02:46:53.560 kind of get into and then when you're
02:46:55.600 trying to construct it and build this
02:46:57.399 right the certain keywords going into AI
02:47:00.560 helps chefs also be able to also present
02:47:04.240 their ideas in in in a better in a
02:47:06.319 better manner right and that that helps
02:47:08.680 me you really pushing it to the extent
02:47:10.760 we have just started using it to be
02:47:12.439 honest we just there a video camera in
02:47:14.359 your your restaurant which is recording
02:47:17.000 eating behaviors and reactions of people
02:47:20.000 consuming the food that's a lot of data
02:47:22.240 collection right we are using our C
02:47:25.279 doing that with their students in all
02:47:27.040 their schools we use our cameras to do
02:47:30.200 uh table heat mapping uh We've so uh so
02:47:34.920 for example we like to see which are the
02:47:36.479 tables that people like to sit at which
02:47:38.200 are the tables that get fill first
02:47:40.240 camera Technologies helping us do that
02:47:42.840 and what is the likely we are we are we
02:47:44.960 are getting to see uh we're getting
02:47:46.800 table counts we're getting to see male
02:47:49.040 versus uh female ratios uh in in our
02:47:52.720 restaurants we are not listening in on
02:47:54.800 them and we're not reading their lips or
02:47:56.160 we are seeing their expressions uh
02:47:59.200 yet that's something that we're going to
02:48:01.200 do that's what we have our our servers
02:48:04.040 because they how do you use what
02:48:05.600 software do you use for this Sorry video
02:48:08.240 Javis I think we use Javis do you guys
02:48:11.560 as a app we don't use table mapping uh
02:48:14.200 but we using AI very extensively not for
02:48:16.960 menu generation but for image creation
02:48:20.680 for even copyrighting MH okay and um
02:48:24.439 we're using it also for videos R I've
02:48:27.680 heard in our research that you're big on
02:48:30.640 design and design is a very big element
02:48:33.359 from the time you had a coffee shop
02:48:34.920 called mocha I've actually been there
02:48:37.120 you had one in kangla back in the day I
02:48:39.080 think like a decade ago how do you go
02:48:42.279 about we all established that ambian
02:48:45.040 says if not as important as food it is
02:48:47.479 very important how do you go about
02:48:50.279 designing the Interiors of a
02:48:53.120 restaurant uh how do you budget for it
02:48:56.000 some hacks around that for somebody
02:48:57.640 starting
02:49:01.040 off I think the design starts with how
02:49:03.640 do you want your uh how do you want your
02:49:07.479 guest to feel right do you want them to
02:49:10.560 feel uh elegant do you want them to feel
02:49:13.520 sophisticated do you want them to feel
02:49:15.479 at home do you want them to feel
02:49:16.800 comfortable do you want them to uh to
02:49:20.040 feel like they're transported into a
02:49:21.640 magical land right I
02:49:23.439 mean I can have the same cup of coffee
02:49:26.439 which I'm holding uh you know either I
02:49:29.800 can hold it like this right which is a
02:49:32.120 different thing I can hold it like this
02:49:35.359 or I can hold it like as a cuddle mug
02:49:37.560 and all these things are very tactile
02:49:39.279 that actually go a very long way in how
02:49:41.680 you feel things that you can feel touch
02:49:44.040 you know all materials have a
02:49:46.160 temperature they have a a texture right
02:49:49.840 and it it conveys something leather
02:49:52.319 conveys something right velvet convey
02:49:55.880 something it's it's feel and then of
02:49:58.479 course you want you want the experience
02:50:00.479 to be in the same cord you want uh you
02:50:03.399 want to feel that particular way so how
02:50:05.479 do you get somebody to feel more
02:50:07.000 sophisticated how do you get somebody to
02:50:08.359 feel a little bit more elant how do you
02:50:10.239 get somebody to feel like okay you know
02:50:12.200 you can come here in your flip flops and
02:50:14.080 they're all starts with design and I
02:50:16.000 think um whether we like it or not
02:50:18.520 everything is designed whether we we we
02:50:21.239 call it designed or
02:50:22.760 not I worked with raz's uh friend very
02:50:25.920 good friend ayaz for the design of my
02:50:28.640 Cafe when we did in Kaba beautiful
02:50:30.600 brother it was it was such a beautiful
02:50:32.359 process the whole thing working with him
02:50:34.760 um and the the you know initially he
02:50:37.120 asked me he's like close your eyes
02:50:39.640 visualize if you could visualize your
02:50:41.359 space as a person who what would that
02:50:43.800 person be and you know when we were
02:50:45.120 talking about he was at a young Shan
02:50:47.600 connary and I said no no no no no it's
02:50:49.600 Monica beluchi and that's when you know
02:50:52.279 then you got the little feminity you got
02:50:54.720 the spad you got you got the final
02:50:56.439 touches so I think it's it's about
02:50:59.160 understanding what the final feel of the
02:51:01.279 place should be like design I think the
02:51:03.720 place do you guys personally get
02:51:05.120 involved now after all this growth do
02:51:07.120 you still partake in the design element
02:51:09.160 of a new restaurant I'd be out of a job
02:51:10.840 if I
02:51:12.200 didn't like I said 10 years AG ago I
02:51:15.399 would have spent less time or I would
02:51:17.760 say like a third of what I do now so
02:51:20.920 design has become just so important to
02:51:23.359 the worldall experience it's no longer
02:51:24.760 just about the food or the drink or
02:51:26.880 design dictates how you feel does it
02:51:29.520 make you feel good does it make you feel
02:51:31.600 luxurious does it make you feel
02:51:32.960 comfortable does it make you feel
02:51:34.399 relaxed so many things are dictated
02:51:36.800 entirely by the design of the space I
02:51:39.560 don't I think I have a decent aesthetic
02:51:42.200 sense but I like to rely on these really
02:51:44.080 talented people I think design has
02:51:45.840 become so important that you have to
02:51:47.880 have access to great people like them to
02:51:50.399 be able to build these beautiful spaces
02:51:52.920 because they can think in a way that at
02:51:54.880 least a person like me can simply not
02:51:57.680 and they bring that extra D the fourth
02:51:59.840 dimension in a way you you want somebody
02:52:03.479 who's going to come to you with a
02:52:06.040 genuinely thought out design with
02:52:08.120 purpose with origin you know with with
02:52:10.840 with Direction you don't want somebody
02:52:12.520 coming to you with a mood board from
02:52:13.960 Pinterest right because that is what
02:52:15.880 design has been reduced to now you see
02:52:18.080 something which is trending on Pinterest
02:52:20.319 you can bet your life that 3 months
02:52:24.359 later you're going to see 40 Restaurants
02:52:26.880 which are going to look exactly the same
02:52:29.760 my first ever store in like the proper
02:52:32.040 first store in bandra I remember the day
02:52:34.000 I signed it I went with my friend
02:52:35.600 pratish who runs company called starting
02:52:37.239 Monday and we went to a cafe and he
02:52:39.520 turned the the the menu upside down and
02:52:42.960 he said close your eyes and describe
02:52:44.880 your store and I described it and as I
02:52:47.200 described it he drew it out and then we
02:52:49.359 took that to a friend's dad who was an
02:52:51.399 architect and said can you please
02:52:52.640 replicate that and then we actually have
02:52:54.640 the picture of the drawing with the
02:52:57.080 store next to it like lovely so I feel
02:53:00.479 so I feel like it's not you know don't
02:53:02.200 be you don't need um too much sometimes
02:53:06.439 sometimes you just need to know what you
02:53:07.720 really want absolutely sometimes just a
02:53:10.479 clever use of paint uh and and you know
02:53:13.800 just
02:53:15.239 uh the right kind of shade of sofa or
02:53:17.880 upholstery that's the magic you don't
02:53:19.760 need anything else a lot of people said
02:53:21.960 ugc they talk about ugc like the Holy
02:53:25.960 Grail uh user generated content they say
02:53:29.279 to get through virality you need to have
02:53:31.279 user generated content how do you
02:53:34.640 incentivize or trigger an audience to do
02:53:37.040 that so for example in our padum store
02:53:38.880 we have three giant macaroons stacked
02:53:41.920 against each other and it's just
02:53:43.359 everyone who enters that store just
02:53:44.880 takes a picture with it like we don't
02:53:46.920 ask them to we don't say stand here take
02:53:48.600 a picture but they walk in and do you
02:53:50.560 incentivize for them taking a picture
02:53:52.200 and tagging you we don't actually
02:53:55.040 Instagram is a tool to be harnessed so a
02:53:58.080 few years ago being
02:53:59.920 instagrammable was very important I
02:54:02.840 think the world has moved on see there
02:54:04.560 there are Cycles in everything the
02:54:05.920 restaurant industry has a cycle shorter
02:54:08.319 than any other industry every 6 months
02:54:10.960 food taste change design taste change in
02:54:14.359 entire you know the entire Vibe around a
02:54:16.760 certain you know area changes entire
02:54:19.359 markets change so I think uh the Cycles
02:54:22.160 are smaller in our industry than perhaps
02:54:25.319 even in the fashion
02:54:26.640 industry any other ideas around I think
02:54:29.279 uniqueness definitely is what what
02:54:31.640 gathers attention I mean that
02:54:33.279 scientifically that's what we're
02:54:34.479 designed to do we we we process a lot
02:54:38.560 less information than we are receiving
02:54:40.640 right so novelty is one great uh you
02:54:44.359 know way of actually would you add one
02:54:45.880 novelty based it definitely is
02:54:48.520 definitely a thumb stoer it definitely
02:54:51.399 is I think one of think those days are
02:54:53.000 gone I think no longer is no required
02:54:56.040 when I went to Japan now I think my
02:54:57.880 whole list was an Instagram fil list of
02:55:00.080 like all these like matcha filled drinks
02:55:03.319 and like food yes I'm talking about from
02:55:05.840 a design perspective from a design
02:55:07.720 perspective I think being instagrammable
02:55:09.840 food or design I mean both for you food
02:55:12.359 I think the more unique it is the more
02:55:14.399 effort you put into the
02:55:15.960 presentation that's going to be forever
02:55:18.920 that see one the larg of liquid nitrogen
02:55:23.600 till it got banned till it got banned
02:55:26.120 the came and had a sip of the liquid
02:55:28.279 nitrogen one of my
02:55:30.319 restaurant and uh we had to get it
02:55:32.200 repaired he was kind enough to not let
02:55:33.840 it out in the public till today is that
02:55:35.520 a good there's a hole in my
02:55:38.080 soul that you need to fill to we how
02:55:41.120 great food Louis burger with gold on it
02:55:44.200 I'll give you that is that going to be
02:55:46.399 an increasingly important element drama
02:55:50.239 to make a restaurant work used to be uh
02:55:52.800 to get eyeballs in the beginning I think
02:55:54.720 or to continue when fzy Cafe opened uh
02:55:58.760 20145 uh 2014 end um it was important to
02:56:03.080 have all this drama tableside theatrics
02:56:06.239 Molecular
02:56:07.399 Gastronomy since then fzy Cafe has done
02:56:09.720 a 180 in the sense that with cycle of
02:56:13.120 things the term Molecular Gastronomy has
02:56:15.720 been in a way bastardized uh people are
02:56:19.279 not using it to the full potential and
02:56:21.200 just using you know some of this drama
02:56:22.640 but not to effect they're doing it as a
02:56:25.160 theat as a theatrical thing not really
02:56:27.080 helping the dish itself so like I said
02:56:30.239 um the TBL side drama has diminished but
02:56:33.439 people still love some form of
02:56:36.239 interesting action dynamism the correct
02:56:39.399 word would be dynamism happening around
02:56:41.279 their food I think people enjoy that but
02:56:43.239 it's lost its importance it's not
02:56:45.120 important anymore to get eyeballs I
02:56:47.560 think the only one thing that'll forever
02:56:49.279 work for a restaurant and for it to grow
02:56:51.960 organically is word of mouth and that is
02:56:55.520 the Holy Grail that is a culmination of
02:56:58.080 culmination of everything so things have
02:57:00.720 to be remarkable right people have to
02:57:03.200 find something to be able to remark
02:57:05.520 about it's very organic so why while you
02:57:08.720 can remove the bells and whistles from
02:57:12.080 like you know there's no need to
02:57:13.399 basically send a post box with a burger
02:57:16.160 inside or you know put
02:57:19.080 put a drink in a bird cage or whatever
02:57:22.600 all that is is I think that is but
02:57:25.120 having good theater is very important
02:57:27.720 right so how uh a great matri D for
02:57:31.000 example is is phenomenal for a
02:57:33.720 restaurant right it's worth their weight
02:57:35.520 and gold something that'll get the
02:57:37.600 remarkable thing going where they will
02:57:39.279 feel the need to actually tell their
02:57:41.560 friend that this is what they've
02:57:43.279 experienced I think if you have a really
02:57:45.000 good meal or experience somebody you
02:57:46.279 want to share it with your friends right
02:57:47.720 like you go out you have a great meal
02:57:50.040 someone's asking you for recommendation
02:57:51.520 where should I go but things like
02:57:52.920 referals don't work they do referals
02:57:56.239 will work like incen if they're coming
02:57:57.960 from a clean space if they see motivated
02:58:01.200 then they're not going to work but
02:58:02.439 people are smart enough to realize that
02:58:04.520 word of mouth is not a simple thing it's
02:58:06.680 a culmination of a 100 different things
02:58:09.479 service the
02:58:11.200 temperature the quality of the napkin
02:58:14.720 the table wear the food the drink how
02:58:17.800 soft were people there's a big
02:58:19.680 difference between service and
02:58:21.960 Hospitality service is
02:58:24.160 simply the aspect of taking a drink and
02:58:27.479 putting it on the table Hospitality
02:58:30.040 dictates how you made that Patron feel
02:58:33.080 and I think that's a very big thing and
02:58:36.560 and and this is something that you know
02:58:38.960 um my I think arguably the greatest
02:58:42.359 restaurer in the world has been harping
02:58:44.479 on about for for years on his new book
02:58:46.479 unreasonable Hospitality talks about it
02:58:48.200 but it's something very deep what is the
02:58:50.120 name of that book everybody should read
02:58:51.399 unreasonable Hospitality it talks
02:58:53.520 exactly about this I think the question
02:58:55.239 is how do you get that how do you get
02:58:56.720 people to talk about it like the
02:58:58.520 culmination of all this you know but oh
02:59:00.720 you know this is a great restaurant
02:59:02.600 everything is fantastic but what is that
02:59:05.239 one thing that there is no one thing no
02:59:07.680 there is they can be they can be that oh
02:59:11.520 you like I said that builds water mouth
02:59:13.600 it could a single there's so many
02:59:15.319 restaurants I go to for one dish one
02:59:17.040 dish one that one dish is enough you
02:59:19.000 know sometimes restaurant built their
02:59:21.960 entire for Generations have survived on
02:59:24.600 one dish how how important is a
02:59:28.319 chef and because he becomes so Cardinal
02:59:32.160 to the business how do you maintain the
02:59:34.560 right Bond where you don't a lead him on
02:59:38.000 or be put him in a position of power if
02:59:40.239 you're a restaurant owner that he can
02:59:43.160 leave and and kill the restaurant if he
02:59:44.960 likes how do you how do you negotiate
02:59:47.760 Chef
02:59:48.920 relationships
02:59:50.560 hacks I mean I'm the I am the chef so if
02:59:54.560 you were to franchise and have another
02:59:56.000 Chef or if you were to open a branch and
02:59:57.640 have another Chef what do you think you
02:59:59.520 would
03:00:00.680 do honestly I think it's and I've seen
03:00:03.680 this with friends with different
03:00:04.840 restaurants where the chef was the main
03:00:08.279 ingredient and then moved on and the
03:00:10.040 restaurants continue to do really well
03:00:12.279 doing better after they've gone and in
03:00:14.520 some cases not in some cases not I just
03:00:17.120 feel that it's
03:00:18.720 um um for me it would just be it's it's
03:00:22.399 more about the product than than the
03:00:25.200 chef um I
03:00:27.359 think it again you know I think that um
03:00:30.640 I think we've all had experiences where
03:00:32.720 we've put our faith in chefs and we've
03:00:34.720 nurtured them and we've given them
03:00:36.880 everything that they've asked for and
03:00:38.479 and at some point of time they've gone
03:00:40.680 looking for a better opportunity for for
03:00:42.800 for a few I think that sometimes that
03:00:45.319 does break your heart I think sometimes
03:00:47.520 that does uh make you feel that you know
03:00:49.600 what screw that I'm not going to do a
03:00:52.000 chef based restaurant again but
03:00:54.399 sometimes when you can really really
03:00:56.239 really know how to handle the diva and
03:00:58.920 make the diva really perform to the best
03:01:01.479 of the capabilities there's a different
03:01:03.399 magic in that so again depending on you
03:01:06.520 know the kind of restaurant you want to
03:01:08.080 do um there are some restaurants where
03:01:10.319 you know people are going to come and
03:01:11.800 you know they will Kiss the Ring of the
03:01:13.120 chef because that is what they're coming
03:01:15.279 for and some they will come for the
03:01:17.479 brand I think that if you if you decided
03:01:21.040 um to to work with a chef who is a diva
03:01:25.680 in you know like a virtual so a Sant in
03:01:30.160 respect then you will have to be able to
03:01:32.200 be sensitive to to their
03:01:35.600 sensitivities so actually when when I
03:01:37.760 had the Kaba Cafe I had a friend of mine
03:01:39.880 who was Colombian and came to to work as
03:01:43.040 the head chef
03:01:44.359 and a lot of it was driven by him you
03:01:47.399 know the place became about him and a
03:01:49.439 lot of the people that came came for him
03:01:50.920 and then when he left I was in that
03:01:52.760 position where I was like oh my God our
03:01:54.160 people going to come back but in fact
03:01:55.880 our sales just grew after um so I feel
03:01:59.080 like it's um um you know it's it's kind
03:02:02.640 of funny in that manner where if you it
03:02:06.239 is bit sweet I think that I think look I
03:02:10.080 think when a symbiotic is beautiful but
03:02:12.800 I think that no one organization or one
03:02:16.040 person is bigger than the sum of the
03:02:18.120 parts yeah I think okay guys Staffing
03:02:22.040 where do you hire restaurant staff from
03:02:26.000 and is there
03:02:27.319 anything in particular you can do to
03:02:29.600 retain that stuff are there any hacks in
03:02:31.479 this industry R you want to go
03:02:34.000 first um I think that
03:02:37.279 uh
03:02:39.640 uh we have fortunately I think Word of
03:02:43.279 Mouth as a good employer is very very
03:02:45.840 important referrals for us are the
03:02:48.720 number one recruitment Source um we
03:02:53.479 encourage our staff to bring us more
03:02:55.319 staff that is the shortest and fastest
03:02:57.560 way of of getting good quality people of
03:03:00.120 course you need to have a robust
03:03:02.160 training program uh you need to know
03:03:05.120 okay you know what do you want to put
03:03:06.120 somebody on the floor what can you do to
03:03:08.000 get them on the floor what are the basic
03:03:09.359 skills they need I am not a big believer
03:03:12.080 in um in education I think is completely
03:03:15.920 a waste of time in in the hospitality
03:03:18.040 business when you say education you mean
03:03:19.800 any kind of degree in the hospitality
03:03:21.359 industry it's it's the thanks sorry it's
03:03:25.040 my sorry no I okay so I okay so I think
03:03:28.840 it means for front of our stuff May mean
03:03:30.479 I don't mean for shifts um you know FCI
03:03:33.760 ncia and kumu of course bring a certain
03:03:36.920 sensibility but when it comes to General
03:03:39.200 stuffff I we are really not looking at
03:03:41.319 the institutions we're looking more more
03:03:43.720 at the pedigree of the institutions that
03:03:45.640 they have worked because then you can
03:03:47.760 really tell you know where they're going
03:03:48.960 to come from you know that ocld which is
03:03:51.560 the overo school of Learning and
03:03:53.560 Development pass out is going to be of a
03:03:56.600 certain cut so firstly I think you
03:03:58.560 select people you should hire people
03:04:02.800 that get pleasure in giving others
03:04:05.080 pleasure how do you do that it is
03:04:08.160 absolutely based on it is absolutely
03:04:10.640 based on a good Talent acquirer somebody
03:04:15.840 who do you use we have in- housee we
03:04:17.880 have obviously we use the talent
03:04:19.439 acquirer uses portals and uses number
03:04:21.880 one thing is always going to be referral
03:04:23.439 you said your head hunters higher from
03:04:26.439 no not even Head Hunter so we call them
03:04:27.720 Talent acquirers so they use a multitude
03:04:29.880 of things I think the number one method
03:04:32.160 is always going to be like you said
03:04:33.840 referrals because these are people that
03:04:35.720 have already seen the work culture
03:04:37.080 they've seen
03:04:38.560 how it is to work in that particular
03:04:41.120 position um what are the benefits Etc
03:04:45.479 right and that's what is our number one
03:04:47.880 methodology but having a good talent
03:04:51.080 acquirer who is able to ensure that the
03:04:55.080 tick marks are ticked in a certain kind
03:04:57.399 of person like I said a person who gets
03:04:59.800 pleasure uh by giving pleasure I think
03:05:02.479 you know a person who feels happiness
03:05:03.880 when he gives pleasure to others I think
03:05:05.600 that's a very very good uh you know
03:05:08.720 virtue to have is there a mechanism to
03:05:10.680 do that like if I have to hire 100
03:05:12.399 people and there is a filter I want to
03:05:14.960 put in place it's interview process you
03:05:17.160 have to call them over you have to meet
03:05:19.040 them you have to figure out if they fit
03:05:20.640 within the culture of your organization
03:05:21.760 and how do you keep them keeping is the
03:05:24.000 is the harder part benefits no
03:05:27.000 approachability and accessibility to
03:05:29.479 yourself if you're HR not it'll be hard
03:05:31.800 for the founder of the company to do
03:05:33.120 that if you have an HR and a management
03:05:36.720 system a hierarchy not just at the HR
03:05:39.520 level but also at the Restaurant level
03:05:41.200 that is highly accessible and
03:05:43.800 approachable then that'll have a huge
03:05:46.439 impact in making sure that your
03:05:49.080 retention rates are high now in
03:05:50.560 typically in the qsr the retention rates
03:05:53.600 in fact the attrition rates are over
03:05:55.160 100% so you're talking about 120%
03:05:57.520 attrition which means more people in a
03:05:59.600 year in a set finite period leave the
03:06:01.800 organization then actually join MH
03:06:03.920 whereas in the CDR space if you're
03:06:05.600 between 30 40% it's good so um I think
03:06:11.120 just be there for them have policies
03:06:13.040 that empathetic have a listening year
03:06:15.439 have an HR and a management system
03:06:16.960 within the restaurant so the first Port
03:06:18.200 of Call is always going to be the
03:06:19.239 manager there has to be some basic
03:06:21.720 empathy training with the managers they
03:06:24.399 have to have uh they have to also be
03:06:26.920 able to impart culture I think building
03:06:28.920 culture is more difficult than building
03:06:31.439 competence MH you can build competence
03:06:34.040 into a person you if they're not trained
03:06:35.840 you can train them how you going to
03:06:37.279 build culture that comes through a
03:06:39.080 concerted effort from every level of
03:06:41.040 hierarchy Puja uh um when I started it
03:06:44.760 was basically just getting people from
03:06:47.880 again referrals started with a small
03:06:49.840 team trained them and then as we started
03:06:51.920 growing it was through agencies that
03:06:53.720 specialized in Hospitality graduates
03:06:56.359 also schools are a which agency is good
03:06:58.520 who do you use um there are a couple um
03:07:01.399 not sure of their names exactly you
03:07:03.640 don't get front of house stuff though no
03:07:05.920 but for kitchen and stuff for for us as
03:07:08.520 well like just going directly to schools
03:07:11.239 and uh recruiting directly that helps
03:07:14.239 yeah c.com is.com is great.com and c.com
03:07:19.239 is specializing in um Hospitality in
03:07:22.080 hospitality is that who you use I do use
03:07:24.800 C and for us LinkedIn works really well
03:07:26.479 ledin does work well okay next question
03:07:29.960 a new one that's come out there's a new
03:07:31.560 one that's come out by Rashmi called
03:07:33.439 Hospitality hope which is really good so
03:07:36.000 website yeah it's a website started
03:07:38.760 by database that is the that's that's
03:07:42.120 actually the best she's not taking a
03:07:43.439 single rupe she's doing this you know as
03:07:46.479 her she's a very prolific writer and
03:07:48.720 she's getting really good talent hooked
03:07:50.680 up with International uh restaurants of
03:07:53.520 real good repute so Hospitality hope if
03:07:55.479 you're looking to go abroad MH much to
03:07:57.720 our detriment uh Hospitality hope is the
03:08:01.479 place but I just saying that but you
03:08:03.000 cannot retain everybody and I know that
03:08:06.080 always is in the hospital business is
03:08:07.800 the best server who will have the
03:08:09.399 drinking problem or the guy who's going
03:08:10.960 to go and disappear for days on end not
03:08:12.840 sure
03:08:14.200 but you have to be able to recognize
03:08:16.120 them first and once you recognize them
03:08:18.479 you got to reward them and then the way
03:08:20.479 to retain them is to tell them that look
03:08:22.760 we see you MH we've spotted youh we are
03:08:25.720 going to put you on a track we're going
03:08:27.200 to put you on a journey mhm 3 years from
03:08:29.960 now this is where you're going to be mhm
03:08:31.720 5 years from now this is where you're
03:08:32.880 going to be and you stick with us 7
03:08:34.160 years from now that's where you're going
03:08:35.720 to be is that key and then deliver
03:08:37.800 showing them a path of growth you have
03:08:39.359 to show them and you have to show them a
03:08:41.080 path of grow because otherwise they
03:08:43.000 there will always be if buts is it
03:08:45.080 primarily Financial growth or is it a
03:08:47.160 growth of stature it is both it is it is
03:08:49.640 both it is a growth in in your
03:08:52.600 designation as well as growth in salary
03:08:55.520 what is the bigger trigger
03:08:58.120 emotionally look emotionally you know
03:09:01.960 having the designation of a manager is a
03:09:03.880 big deal having the the designation of
03:09:06.800 an executive or executive is a big deal
03:09:11.080 and people want that they want to be
03:09:13.120 able to know that they are you know in
03:09:15.279 in a position of authority but at the
03:09:17.760 end of the day that doesn't fill your
03:09:19.640 stomach alone you need to be able to
03:09:21.439 have cash service charge goes a very
03:09:23.560 long way in making sure that we can
03:09:25.720 retain our talent ensuring that you know
03:09:28.279 it's distributed they benefit from the
03:09:30.399 company that builds team working uh as
03:09:33.680 said a very strong culture really really
03:09:36.120 helps because they know that this is a
03:09:37.680 family and this Collective
03:09:39.600 responsibility you can't let each other
03:09:41.200 down so these things cumulatively add up
03:09:43.560 but at the end of the day this is what
03:09:45.359 I've learned from the chatties and the
03:09:48.359 UDP restaurant I'm from there by the way
03:09:51.560 that that is you cannot break a Shetty
03:09:55.479 restaurant guy why
03:09:58.040 because he knows he's dishwashing today
03:10:01.399 if he puts his nose to the ground if he
03:10:04.200 does the hard yards 10 years from now
03:10:06.920 he'll be managing his own restaurant 15
03:10:09.319 years from now he'll be a partner he
03:10:11.479 knows it right and this they have a
03:10:13.680 beautiful system where they send money
03:10:15.760 home uh to the wives and to the mothers
03:10:19.279 they take care of the kids education
03:10:20.800 they take care of all the medical needs
03:10:23.080 these guys are given a place to stay and
03:10:24.640 a little bit of pocket money but this
03:10:26.680 system is fantastic and there's a lot to
03:10:28.800 learn but the important thing is that a
03:10:31.600 clear path career path is given to them
03:10:35.040 that if you do this and if you stay this
03:10:37.239 long this is where you will go and that
03:10:39.439 is good enough for them it is the
03:10:41.439 uncertainty of of you know that
03:10:44.000 progression uncertainty of where they
03:10:46.359 will be a couple of years from now is
03:10:48.200 what causes unrest in my opinion makes
03:10:51.279 sense uh
03:10:53.359 festivals seasonal stuff if I were to be
03:10:56.720 starting a restaurant today as a 22-year
03:10:59.399 old how do I incorporate that into my
03:11:02.000 business plan is it a big part for us
03:11:05.359 yes Christmas Diwali yeah so we start
03:11:08.399 with I mean for us season actually
03:11:11.000 starts in September mhm uh um August
03:11:14.040 actually start with raki and then you go
03:11:16.399 to ganpati at least in Bombay you have
03:11:18.399 ganpati then you have Diwali then you
03:11:20.479 have Christmas then you have Valentine's
03:11:21.960 Day and then you have holy and then
03:11:23.840 after that it's a little bit of a slow
03:11:25.760 and then this whole season is also a big
03:11:28.279 season for like weddings parties people
03:11:30.960 are doing caterings so we do a lot of
03:11:33.239 that and then April to se uh April to
03:11:37.680 July is kind of like a little bit slow
03:11:39.800 so we have to figure out what we do
03:11:41.160 during those months so see seasonality
03:11:43.319 at least with us is quite important and
03:11:45.399 for you guys as well it's a big thing
03:11:48.200 seasonality so there are two different
03:11:49.960 things one is I think your question was
03:11:51.840 also regarding festivities right India
03:11:54.399 is a deeply spiritual country um there
03:11:56.760 are many festivals that happen that have
03:11:58.520 a direct impact on the business of your
03:12:00.880 restaurant or delivery service MH for
03:12:02.920 example you have ganpati in Bombay when
03:12:05.359 you have ganpati in Bombay you're going
03:12:07.120 to see a reduction in dining out you're
03:12:09.840 going to see a reduction in non-wage
03:12:11.120 consumption you're going to see a
03:12:12.120 reduction in alcohol consumption people
03:12:14.160 are going to not go out as much when you
03:12:16.880 have navatra in North India you have a
03:12:19.720 major reduction in the number of people
03:12:22.640 going out non-w consumption goes down
03:12:24.680 very sharply right so I think there are
03:12:27.200 two different things seasonality affects
03:12:28.680 everybody equally uh festivals affect
03:12:31.720 certain kinds of restaurants a
03:12:32.920 vegetarian restaurant would be less
03:12:34.120 impacted during navratras in North India
03:12:36.800 whereas a non-er restaurant or or a bar
03:12:38.680 would get more deeply impacted uh these
03:12:40.760 are just the realities of being in the
03:12:42.040 country you have to to mitigate this by
03:12:44.399 in a sense planning in advance coming up
03:12:47.399 with special things like a navatra Tali
03:12:50.200 or um better offers better deals during
03:12:53.200 these specific times and these tiny
03:12:54.760 things can significantly throw up
03:12:56.680 revenues right they can mitigate I don't
03:12:59.319 think they can throw I don't think they
03:13:00.399 can completely resolve the the you know
03:13:03.560 the impact or you know completely absorb
03:13:05.600 the impact they definitely can mitigate
03:13:07.560 to a large extent and it's it's just the
03:13:09.880 reality of being in a country like India
03:13:11.439 where there are um festivals that have a
03:13:15.080 huge impact on the socio economic fabric
03:13:18.000 s that will have um an impact on your
03:13:20.800 business directly and as a result you're
03:13:23.399 going to have to mitigate in some way
03:13:25.040 shape or form okay so at the end of this
03:13:28.800 podcast uh did I miss anything
03:13:31.800 guys I think um but firstly you've
03:13:34.600 covered everything there is a crash
03:13:36.319 course in restauran thing took us years
03:13:39.359 to do this you just gave everybody the
03:13:41.200 low down
03:13:43.720 um I think you can charge a lot of money
03:13:46.120 for this podcast if you were to monetize
03:13:47.920 it 7our podcast 7 hours 7 hours 7 hours
03:13:53.920 okay six hours six hours at the
03:14:00.479 end we had great K we had for another
03:14:05.080 two hours and then I go amazing macarons
03:14:07.479 with some amazing
03:14:09.080 coffee
03:14:11.479 h
03:14:13.000 can we please talk about that please
03:14:16.439 plug in a part of the video you you have
03:14:18.680 plug it in plug it in plug it the one
03:14:20.160 that I'm looking good we have to talk
03:14:22.040 about this yeah we are talking about it
03:14:23.720 the recording have we done
03:14:26.120 no no such thing j my god do you still
03:14:30.600 dance so I dance extremely poorly on TV
03:14:35.080 I don't know how I wasal TV on National
03:14:37.720 so I'll tell you what I learned out of
03:14:39.319 this whole thing wait before you tell me
03:14:40.800 what you learned out of it what made you
03:14:42.200 do it
03:14:43.680 my wife my son was adamant against it
03:14:47.600 because he thought my being on that show
03:14:49.479 and being the foolish dancer that I am
03:14:51.160 will make a fool out of him in his
03:14:53.359 school my wife said you've always been
03:14:55.720 the kind of guy who's taken on these
03:14:57.200 kind of tough things that you you're not
03:14:58.680 comfortable with things that are out of
03:15:00.319 your comfort zone that's the only reason
03:15:01.960 I did it the obviously other reason was
03:15:03.720 to be on a large scale TV show let's be
03:15:06.279 very honest about it by being on that
03:15:09.520 show and I hadn't done Master Chef I had
03:15:11.279 done Master Chef in 2016 so like several
03:15:13.520 I've done other stuff but not of
03:15:15.120 relevance this was a fairly large show I
03:15:17.520 took it on as a challenge I even now
03:15:19.800 don't know how to dance well but I had
03:15:21.479 the best choreographer who put her her
03:15:24.279 life energy into me she tried her best
03:15:26.800 and the only reason I survived almost
03:15:29.160 half that well actually half that show
03:15:31.880 was because I felt a sense of
03:15:33.359 responsibility towards suchitra so big
03:15:35.479 shout out to suchitra you're like a rock
03:15:37.080 star I love you I'm going to see you in
03:15:38.720 bumbay very soon she's my sister she and
03:15:41.199 her husband were my choreographer ERS
03:15:43.080 they were the wind beneath my wings
03:15:45.000 literally and they were able to extract
03:15:47.840 something out of me that I simply did
03:15:49.680 not know I had and to this day I think
03:15:52.479 it's simply a testament to her efforts
03:15:54.319 number one and be my ability to not give
03:15:56.439 a damn nice I think that's the coolest
03:15:59.160 thing not giving beautiful that's
03:16:00.720 beautiful right absolutely I would have
03:16:04.960 the petrii I'll
03:16:08.040 do you would natur yeah you do you're
03:16:11.080 natural you're doing Master listen
03:16:12.439 proves it okay so this show uh is meant
03:16:18.920 solely as an exercise in education for
03:16:23.479 entrepreneurs we've all been lucky uh to
03:16:27.000 help other
03:16:28.520 people be in the right position to get
03:16:30.960 lucky we build this content and and you
03:16:33.359 know thank you guys for flying down to
03:16:34.960 Bangalore and spending the amount of
03:16:36.560 time you have uh I think this will be
03:16:39.840 incredibly useful to so many many young
03:16:42.840 people who want to start a
03:16:44.520 restaurant another thing we do is we
03:16:46.720 don't have any uh sponsors we don't do
03:16:48.840 any advertising and at the end of every
03:16:50.920 show we try and do uh should I call it a
03:16:54.640 good deed I don't know but we we kind of
03:16:57.600 like do something to pass the Baton
03:17:00.120 along and help somebody else uh in the
03:17:04.239 last episode for example we decided to
03:17:07.160 fund a young entrepreneur trying to
03:17:10.040 build a business in fashion or in
03:17:12.520 cosmetics or in home decor who's under
03:17:15.680 the age of 22 23 uh so I'd like to
