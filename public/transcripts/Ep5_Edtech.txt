00:00:00.000 top three percent of kids get into these
00:00:02.100 good colleges what about the 97 if
00:00:04.980 education was online can that compete or
00:00:08.460 compare with real life education I think
00:00:10.559 I've been blessed by not being uh
00:00:12.840 spoiled with a lot of fundraising
00:00:15.290 [Applause]
00:00:20.539 do you think balance is an important
00:00:23.580 part of being a successful entrepreneur
00:00:25.740 no I hate balance I think balance is
00:00:28.500 very important part of anything the
00:00:29.939 opportunity and the way this country is
00:00:31.859 changing is a Once In A Century Century
00:00:35.040 or more Bill Gates has started this
00:00:37.320 windows that has made him a billionaire
00:00:39.300 and I want to start doors kind of cool
00:00:44.620 [Music]
00:00:50.219 so thank you guys for coming I think
00:00:52.559 most of you here do not need an
00:00:54.059 introduction
00:00:55.020 but maybe a good way to start this is
00:00:59.039 a how do we all know each other
00:01:01.260 and
00:01:02.219 B maybe talk about ourselves for a
00:01:04.500 minute or two so we just get to know
00:01:06.299 each other a bit more would you like to
00:01:07.860 go first
00:01:09.600 um I'm the only non-billionaire on this
00:01:12.060 panel
00:01:13.439 um
00:01:15.360 um I know Ronnie because he runs upgrad
00:01:17.939 and uh
00:01:19.740 I run this company called an academy and
00:01:22.500 uh I I don't know how how do I know you
00:01:25.140 how do we ended up Bangalore I think you
00:01:27.299 have this uh yeah you were doing a party
00:01:29.340 one day I got a message and uh yeah I'm
00:01:32.820 meeting for the first time maybe you can
00:01:34.920 tell us
00:01:36.900 a more creative version of introducing
00:01:39.960 yourself
00:01:41.100 so don't say what you would say in a job
00:01:43.500 interview in a college interview or a TV
00:01:46.439 interview but tell us what you would
00:01:48.659 tell your friends
00:01:50.579 who is gaurav
00:01:53.159 let me
00:01:54.840 phrase my have you had a job interview
00:01:57.060 yeah once oh okay well that's a good
00:02:00.060 start so all of you are like Mega brains
00:02:02.340 okay which college did you go to so I'll
00:02:04.680 I'll start from the beginning so
00:02:06.659 um I I was one bikaner and then father's
00:02:10.619 a doctor grew up in Jaipur
00:02:12.660 middle class family
00:02:15.360 um
00:02:16.080 but uh I think at the age of 12 I went
00:02:19.379 to my dad and said you know I saw in
00:02:21.900 dainik Bhaskar newspaper
00:02:23.940 Bill Gates has started this windows that
00:02:26.520 has made him a billionaire and I want to
00:02:28.620 start doors and I was coding at that
00:02:31.140 point so kind of cool at some way I was
00:02:34.920 I could have been the poster boy white
00:02:36.660 hat Junior because I was uh but but
00:02:38.879 we'll get to white high Junior at some
00:02:40.440 point
00:02:41.640 um when I was 11 or 12 I was
00:02:43.459 aggressively coding
00:02:46.260 um you know like like you were
00:02:47.400 interested in elocution Etc I never
00:02:51.239 um was into sports I was into computers
00:02:54.900 gaming
00:02:56.280 um are you a Bright Child good marks in
00:02:58.080 school uh like I would study just before
00:03:00.780 the exam and I would get 80 85 and some
00:03:03.840 of the teachers but every parent's
00:03:06.239 teacher meeting
00:03:07.319 I would get reprimanded at home because
00:03:09.420 I would I was I I think I had this
00:03:13.440 rebellious nature which I still do where
00:03:16.080 I just had to take my teachers to a
00:03:19.560 breaking point like I had to say
00:03:21.659 something in the class or something like
00:03:23.099 that but
00:03:24.480 uh but then this coding thing I was 15
00:03:27.659 years old when I started ex-res so we
00:03:31.019 had a school magazine called x-rays and
00:03:33.540 I could not get selected in it so I went
00:03:35.819 to the principal who was father Joe's
00:03:38.280 Jacob and I told him I'll start this ex
00:03:40.920 race
00:03:41.879 and I got to build a new team and you
00:03:46.019 know it was launched in school Etc so I
00:03:48.120 think that was the first test where I
00:03:49.560 realized that
00:03:50.700 maybe I'm I mean I I could study Physics
00:03:54.780 chemistry maths when I could but I was
00:03:56.280 never excited about it I always loved
00:03:59.040 Building Products
00:04:01.140 um I remember
00:04:03.540 uh
00:04:04.739 you know I built this bot in college
00:04:06.720 called Pingu you know it was it was like
00:04:09.840 a much basic version of what what's we
00:04:11.819 are seeing today but you could you could
00:04:13.500 say that I'm getting bored and it would
00:04:15.060 give you that so I think and at some
00:04:17.339 point the coding and the tech part got
00:04:20.040 merged with content
00:04:21.660 so
00:04:23.460 um I used to run these blogs in college
00:04:25.199 and ended up making two three thousand
00:04:27.120 dollars a month which used to be a lot
00:04:29.220 because
00:04:30.900 and Mims Mumbai and what were you
00:04:33.960 studying computer energy
00:04:35.940 uh but more than that would spend a lot
00:04:39.840 of time creating these blogs they used
00:04:41.880 to get a million likes quora I started
00:04:44.460 writing a lot after college Roman my
00:04:46.919 co-founder and I are in at some point
00:04:49.440 became the top 20 most followed people
00:04:51.360 on quora just because we were writing so
00:04:53.600 at some point we found this an unacademy
00:04:56.280 in fact started as a YouTube channel you
00:04:58.259 should say a bit about your co-founder
00:04:59.639 he's like some academically like a
00:05:01.740 anomaly of sorts yeah I'm getting there
00:05:04.259 so we started creating videos
00:05:07.680 um I started creating computer science
00:05:09.720 videos but they didn't get a lot of
00:05:13.020 views but they got like 50 000 60 000
00:05:14.940 views and then
00:05:16.680 um I met Roman and I know each other
00:05:19.320 from school where we used to go to
00:05:21.540 chemistry tuitions together
00:05:23.340 and at some point he was a names he had
00:05:26.100 just become a doctor he was the youngest
00:05:27.900 doctor and then somehow he ended up
00:05:30.900 cracking
00:05:32.220 he was just about to crack the UPS exam
00:05:34.380 but the results were not out
00:05:36.900 and the day he cracked I called him up I
00:05:39.120 thought this is a great opportunity I
00:05:40.560 mean he has cracked the examination he
00:05:41.940 has three months before he has to go to
00:05:43.259 labasna why not I should get some free
00:05:45.900 videos out of him
00:05:47.220 so it was done as a Content project but
00:05:49.800 those videos what were these videos
00:05:51.060 about what did you do upsc preparation
00:05:53.160 because I was making computer science
00:05:55.259 videos
00:05:57.900 but when his video came
00:06:00.300 we got a million views the channel
00:06:01.919 became one of the biggest channels Etc
00:06:03.360 YouTube channel yeah
00:06:05.460 um YouTube channel and Academy
00:06:07.440 and then next one one and a half years
00:06:09.419 uh himesh and my other co-founder we had
00:06:11.759 started this company called Flat chat it
00:06:13.860 was like Tinder but for finding
00:06:15.060 roommates this I had started when I was
00:06:16.860 in college and nmimus I'd raised my
00:06:19.560 first Angel investment I in fact got a
00:06:21.780 first Angel investment offer when I was
00:06:24.120 in fourth year of college
00:06:25.560 but then I got this software engineering
00:06:27.539 job which was the first job
00:06:29.639 um pretty good job so
00:06:31.380 for me to come from a middle class
00:06:33.000 background and say no to that kind of
00:06:35.460 offer I think it was 16 lakhs per annum
00:06:38.280 back in 2012.
00:06:41.460 um I mean it was too good to refuse and
00:06:44.039 then one year I stayed there I paid off
00:06:45.840 my educational loans I had taken an
00:06:47.819 education loan to study in college
00:06:50.300 and then at some point like you said
00:06:53.340 that I realized I cannot work for
00:06:54.840 somebody else's vision
00:06:56.280 I mean I was too much of a rebel to work
00:07:01.020 for somebody else so
00:07:03.120 then flat chart was started which common
00:07:05.819 floor bought in 2014 that's how I came
00:07:08.280 to Bangalore and then I was with common
00:07:10.740 flow for one one and a half years uh
00:07:13.199 learned how to scale a company flat chat
00:07:15.419 was small it was sold in 10 months so
00:07:17.639 did an academy start like that was it a
00:07:19.800 video channel which became a business
00:07:21.960 yes so you started monetizing this
00:07:25.139 channel yes
00:07:26.639 we started monetizing it but when Roman
00:07:28.860 went to labasna he was not
00:07:31.919 um I mean he was not allowed to make
00:07:33.240 money so he stopped monetization the
00:07:35.819 educational anomaly I was talking about
00:07:37.740 is he became a doctor and then uh is
00:07:40.020 Officer yeah
00:07:42.300 yeah that's and then it's lovely and
00:07:43.979 then you know there was this one one and
00:07:45.840 a half years of
00:07:47.220 convincing we would talk every night it
00:07:50.340 was clear that both of us would talk
00:07:51.599 figure out a way to convince his parents
00:07:53.639 on how uh he should leave is ETC and
00:07:56.759 when did an academy become all that it
00:07:58.620 is in terms of scale the same question I
00:08:00.419 asked him when did you realize an
00:08:03.060 academy is big
00:08:06.360 no so we had that
00:08:09.680 intrinsic optimism that we have to make
00:08:12.300 this big I mean one guy is he was the
00:08:15.900 assistant collector of jabalpur I mean
00:08:17.880 he's leaving that
00:08:19.379 uh and then
00:08:21.479 um you know we we knew that this is we
00:08:23.759 are going all in like working 16 hours a
00:08:26.340 day seven days a week we we had to go
00:08:28.979 all in and we had to make it big the
00:08:30.900 question wasn't so
00:08:32.279 see people don't realize a lot of times
00:08:33.958 we went through at least 10 pivots
00:08:37.039 before we realized our business model in
00:08:39.419 2019. so 2015 is when we started the
00:08:41.940 company when Roman quit when himesh quit
00:08:43.620 when I quit both of emission I quit
00:08:45.779 common flow Roman quettias
00:08:47.760 four years it took us 10 plus pivots to
00:08:50.339 realize what's our business model but
00:08:51.600 once we cracked the business model this
00:08:53.100 is I remember 2019 uh we were on a
00:08:56.519 Founders Retreat and we we start seeing
00:09:00.240 Revenue numbers that we are doing 30
00:09:02.100 lakhs a day 40 lakhs a day and this is
00:09:04.380 the first time we had seen Revenue pmf
00:09:06.300 we had seen views pmf we were creating
00:09:08.640 content so
00:09:09.959 we we had seen that Journey that our
00:09:12.060 videos were doing 100 million views a
00:09:13.800 month so that Journey we had already
00:09:15.540 seen but when we started seeing Revenue
00:09:18.240 p and pmf that's when we knew we had hit
00:09:20.700 something but it took us at least four
00:09:22.800 years plus 10 pivots to get there would
00:09:25.320 you like to go next yeah sure uh proud
00:09:28.680 of having a very low middle class
00:09:30.300 upbringing uh keeps your feet on the
00:09:33.060 ground and I think I'm around because
00:09:34.860 I've kept my feet on the ground most of
00:09:36.600 my life that's why I'm I'm still walking
00:09:39.000 around the place I think it's very
00:09:40.500 important
00:09:42.060 um
00:09:42.839 I had a great first Innings and a lot of
00:09:45.180 fun
00:09:46.980 um by seeking or being an entrepreneur
00:09:49.080 but in a way we don't know how you
00:09:51.120 started off where did you grow up
00:09:54.120 grew up in Mumbai in graduate school
00:09:56.660 sorry where did you go to school I went
00:09:59.100 to school in a place called Dunn's
00:10:00.720 Institute okay okay what did your
00:10:03.060 parents do my dad has been a
00:10:05.339 professional he worked with the tala
00:10:06.839 group for a long time and I think before
00:10:08.700 he retired he spent about 10 years with
00:10:10.740 a UK company called GL Morrison that
00:10:13.500 made me a cream and my dad's and my
00:10:16.019 brothers
00:10:16.700 the PHD in HR and then I don't know at
00:10:20.459 my young age
00:10:21.959 figured out that I may not be that good
00:10:24.240 implementing somebody else's vision
00:10:26.519 so felt
00:10:28.500 I need to start off and do something of
00:10:30.600 my own
00:10:32.399 and that was when I had to decide
00:10:34.380 whether I wanted to do an MBA
00:10:36.240 I will
00:10:38.040 19 20.
00:10:40.560 and I think at that stage
00:10:43.279 good question future exactly it's about
00:10:46.079 78 1978.
00:10:49.680 okay so I don't know whether that's got
00:10:50.940 a validity stamp today in relevance to
00:10:53.519 everyone since everyone had a lot of
00:10:55.220 raised eyebrows here but um
00:11:00.060 yeah I was an excellent Crossroad to
00:11:02.640 very clear learning lessons for me at
00:11:04.740 that early stage
00:11:06.600 one is when my dad said okay I don't
00:11:09.540 really figure out what you want to do
00:11:11.160 but why don't you do your MBA do your
00:11:12.779 child accountancy and then if you want
00:11:14.100 to still run something on your own start
00:11:16.320 that way
00:11:18.000 and I was quite clear that if I had a
00:11:19.980 plan B in my life then plan a wouldn't
00:11:22.500 work out because I think that's half the
00:11:24.779 situation right when you want to start
00:11:26.220 something and you feel you have an
00:11:28.380 optionality you're going to run aground
00:11:30.779 definitely 10 times and I think the
00:11:33.000 other thing that both my parents told me
00:11:34.380 is look if you're going to do that we
00:11:36.060 don't have the way with all to bail you
00:11:37.500 out
00:11:38.220 so we'll have a lot of love and a lot of
00:11:40.560 affection but we're not going to bail
00:11:41.760 you out
00:11:42.600 so I think that's a good good segue to
00:11:45.420 start off
00:11:46.500 at a time when there was no angel or VC
00:11:48.480 funding so what did you start first
00:11:52.620 um
00:11:53.579 I started a cable TV company
00:11:56.339 that started wiring up all of Mumbai and
00:11:59.880 most the five-star hotels
00:12:02.519 there was a time when the TV sets didn't
00:12:06.120 have a remote control
00:12:08.700 so not only did we have to start selling
00:12:10.980 the concept to people we also had to
00:12:12.779 sell Concepts to the TV manufacturers to
00:12:14.760 start making multi-channel TV sets that
00:12:17.339 particular point in time so that was why
00:12:18.959 I think first
00:12:20.339 so Jordan to starting something
00:12:22.500 and then
00:12:23.760 when was the big moment where there's
00:12:26.459 never been a big moment I think big
00:12:28.019 moments are overplayed in life okay when
00:12:30.779 did Ronnie screwwala become Ronnie's
00:12:32.820 Cruella to people who don't know you
00:12:35.100 who didn't know you personally when did
00:12:37.260 you become a figure per se
00:12:41.040 yeah so I don't know about that criteria
00:12:42.839 because beauty is in the eye of the
00:12:43.980 beholder so I don't think any one person
00:12:45.980 defines where the other one is but
00:12:48.860 media is a profile that gets you
00:12:51.779 somewhere so I think early media days
00:12:54.180 then later media days and then I think
00:12:56.700 when we morph to be you started cable
00:12:58.560 yeah did very well in cable
00:13:00.720 five years then sold it how much do you
00:13:03.600 sell it for
00:13:04.800 literally nothing I think that's the
00:13:07.560 stage where it was getting quite messy
00:13:09.300 there were a lot of copyright issues and
00:13:10.860 I just felt that was not my DNA to build
00:13:12.720 a business that would have so many
00:13:14.700 challenges at that very early stage in
00:13:16.620 life okay so
00:13:18.839 it was a chance when my the the CEO that
00:13:21.959 are appointed came in and resigned and
00:13:24.180 said I'm gonna go to a South Indian
00:13:25.980 party who wants to start cable TV so I
00:13:28.680 said well would you check with them
00:13:29.820 whether they want to buy this because
00:13:31.019 then you can buy it run it and go
00:13:32.339 forward that's pretty much out so did
00:13:34.920 you use the Corpus from selling the
00:13:36.600 Cable business to start the media stuff
00:13:38.880 so media I think again is Serendipity in
00:13:41.820 many ways right because
00:13:44.579 um as coming from the lower middle class
00:13:46.860 home I think I
00:13:49.320 since I hadn't studied for me learning
00:13:51.660 soft skills was an important element so
00:13:53.519 instead of doing boxing and football in
00:13:55.139 school I did elocution debates
00:13:57.500 Dramatics theater
00:14:00.240 and front of camera hosting at that
00:14:03.000 particular Point what did you do in
00:14:04.380 media first
00:14:06.180 so literally that it was pretty much
00:14:08.820 that and I think the first thing that
00:14:10.260 happened is there was an advertising
00:14:12.180 agency called linta's law and Alec
00:14:14.339 padamsi who used to do a lot of theater
00:14:16.680 with Eisler theater with so he came in
00:14:18.959 one fine day and said you know Hindustan
00:14:21.060 levers wants to do India's first sponsor
00:14:23.100 program
00:14:24.200 and that's pretty much how the company
00:14:26.760 was born and he said we're going to make
00:14:28.500 13 episodes of a TV show or do you want
00:14:31.260 to make it
00:14:32.160 and I said well why are you coming to me
00:14:33.959 he says you just look like the guy who's
00:14:35.279 going to be able to put it all together
00:14:37.019 and I think that's how the media path
00:14:38.940 started and that led to movies and UTV
00:14:41.699 movies much later I think didn't have
00:14:44.160 funding for almost six seven years so
00:14:46.260 when you don't have funding you build a
00:14:47.459 B2B model so we were a Cost Plus model
00:14:49.860 for everything else we started making TV
00:14:51.480 content right and doing lots of stuff
00:14:53.959 and that's when I realized for the first
00:14:56.639 time to get in private Equity get
00:14:59.040 external investors and then media
00:15:01.560 started getting defined almost 10 years
00:15:04.079 later into the business so I'd say it
00:15:06.420 was good fun being in the formative part
00:15:08.100 of it and I think that's what I thrive
00:15:09.899 on right
00:15:13.199 how did media lead to movies lead to
00:15:16.440 upgrad
00:15:17.459 startup Investments and all the other
00:15:19.680 things that you do
00:15:21.480 so media state is Media I think the day
00:15:23.699 I realized that if I want to build
00:15:24.959 something at scale and build a brand
00:15:27.779 then you need to be in the b2c part of
00:15:29.760 the business so I think over a period of
00:15:31.860 two years I remember one investor call
00:15:33.959 because we've just gone public
00:15:36.720 and predictability and margins came into
00:15:39.360 the picture and I said actually I'm not
00:15:41.279 so much in control of what I'm doing
00:15:42.959 because I'm a B2B model so we morphed
00:15:46.260 when we started being a broadcaster
00:15:48.000 about 10 channels
00:15:49.980 and then started a movie studio the
00:15:52.019 first five movies we made were disasters
00:15:54.060 in every sense of the world and most
00:15:55.980 people would say why are you ever in
00:15:57.360 that business kind of situation why are
00:15:59.579 you in that business
00:16:00.839 because I needed to build a b2c brand
00:16:02.699 and you can't build a b2c brand in Media
00:16:05.399 if you're not in the big screen part of
00:16:07.139 it and what is the need to build the
00:16:09.360 brand uh like just for me I think I was
00:16:12.120 starting to get obsessed with scale okay
00:16:13.920 and I think value like if you see there
00:16:16.019 are 30 40 companies in media that have
00:16:17.940 got listed since the time we did that
00:16:19.500 right and I think if you look at their
00:16:21.240 market cap for the last 20 25 years they
00:16:24.360 haven't moved more than 10 cumulatively
00:16:26.519 in the last 25 years so my realization
00:16:29.100 to unlock and create value was to build
00:16:32.519 a integrated model versus being a pure
00:16:35.220 play and at that stage I think for six
00:16:37.079 seven years I got slaughtered by
00:16:38.699 everyone saying where's your focus why
00:16:41.160 are you not only into one single aspect
00:16:43.139 then you get competitor reviews from
00:16:46.079 different people
00:16:47.279 but I think normally when you're going
00:16:49.920 against the grain and you know it
00:16:51.899 means when a lot of people think they're
00:16:54.540 not understood your model I've found
00:16:56.040 that that's normally where 10x 10x or
00:16:58.800 20x value gets created
00:17:00.720 so do you think these still hold true
00:17:03.120 like b2c is where value can really be
00:17:05.400 created even today
00:17:07.439 a b2c business today using an in media
00:17:09.839 specifically not not in media and
00:17:11.339 anything
00:17:12.240 yeah it's a tougher one so I think when
00:17:14.099 one got into education and one got into
00:17:16.679 learning
00:17:18.179 the first Crossroad was whether we
00:17:20.160 should start B2B because it's a tricky
00:17:22.679 business right in a sense it's education
00:17:24.419 is a very formatted formal World in
00:17:27.000 every sense of the world everyone's very
00:17:28.380 predictable uh it's calendar event in
00:17:31.500 your life so to speak and to break that
00:17:33.780 up and say I want to build something
00:17:35.039 you're going to easily started the B2B
00:17:36.960 way but I was quite clear we should
00:17:38.460 start b2c
00:17:40.080 and that was a tougher tougher model to
00:17:42.480 go but I think no regrets in the last
00:17:44.280 six years and the second thing do you
00:17:46.380 often make more money by being counter
00:17:49.440 trend
00:17:50.640 I think
00:17:52.740 I'll answer that maybe two ways I think
00:17:55.919 um my ratio of eight failures to two
00:17:59.760 successes is something that I've hold on
00:18:01.740 to quite well it's not that I go out to
00:18:03.960 do it in that it's not a formula
00:18:06.000 but I think when you're when you fail as
00:18:08.340 often as you do that's a minus 1X every
00:18:11.220 time it could be a big minus 1X it could
00:18:13.080 be a minus one x 10 million dollars 100
00:18:15.720 million dollars a bad higher a bad
00:18:17.700 decision pulling the plug on a business
00:18:19.679 sticking with a business whatever else
00:18:21.299 but it's a minus One X
00:18:23.220 but because you've done that when you do
00:18:26.940 get a success it's 30X party X and I
00:18:30.480 think that if you don't have that law of
00:18:32.100 averages working the chances of you
00:18:33.840 having success will be 2x 3x 4X which is
00:18:36.419 still fantastic
00:18:37.799 but that 30x40x doesn't come about
00:18:40.919 unless there's a lot that you've done
00:18:43.020 which is
00:18:44.460 by your mind has allowed your instinct
00:18:47.640 and your gut to really get a little bit
00:18:49.320 more polished to just feel confirmed
00:18:52.260 because at the end of the day it's not
00:18:54.000 about gut right it's a lot to do with
00:18:56.460 your own self-conviction
00:18:58.620 when everything else fails self
00:19:00.480 confliction being self-conviction
00:19:02.400 conviction being yeah I think that at
00:19:04.980 the end of the day if I have to say what
00:19:07.200 do I have as the reservoir it's a
00:19:09.059 self-conviction right because how do you
00:19:11.280 get out of failure self-confliction is
00:19:13.559 that conviction in yourself or
00:19:15.360 conviction
00:19:17.039 in the cyclical nature of a sector that
00:19:19.679 you're betting has to be in yourself has
00:19:21.780 to be in yourself
00:19:23.340 yeah I don't think anyone can have such
00:19:25.080 conviction or a cyclical part of a
00:19:26.820 business or even in a sector
00:19:29.820 yeah and how does Ronnie spend time
00:19:31.500 today like how much time does Which
00:19:33.419 business take up
00:19:35.520 so I'm not a I'm not very big at
00:19:37.860 breaking up yeah time I think the
00:19:40.320 elasticity I think I've been blessed
00:19:42.919 with uh keeping my feet on the ground
00:19:45.660 most of the time I think I've been
00:19:47.220 blessed by not being uh spoiled with a
00:19:51.120 lot of fundraising from time to time
00:19:52.679 which I think really corrupts people and
00:19:55.200 corrupts minds and corrupts businesses
00:19:56.880 and corrupts many other things but I've
00:19:58.919 also been Most Blessed that I enjoy
00:20:00.480 everything that I've done so I think my
00:20:01.980 media part
00:20:03.360 to do that uh and the level at which you
00:20:06.539 do it and I think what I'm doing right
00:20:08.340 now whether it's our not-for-profit
00:20:10.080 foundation or whether it's going back
00:20:13.260 and doing a little bit of Storytelling
00:20:14.940 in the movies mostly with
00:20:17.460 the Skilling and Workforce Development
00:20:19.919 and learning platform that we're trying
00:20:22.440 to build globally and a little bit
00:20:24.780 having fun with sports teams like
00:20:27.360 recovery one we both have a sports team
00:20:29.160 right in the same league we both have
00:20:30.840 two uh sports teams technically yeah
00:20:34.280 table tennis table tennis it's a small
00:20:37.380 it's a smaller property but still fun
00:20:39.059 yeah yeah do you guys ever like I mean I
00:20:41.700 know you don't play kabaddi I'm hoping
00:20:43.380 the answer is that like but table tennis
00:20:45.539 you must enjoy it yeah yeah have you
00:20:48.419 tried kabaddi kabaddi for me would go
00:20:51.360 back a long time right I mean
00:20:54.000 unfortunately not young enough
00:20:57.179 I've played a little bit right but
00:20:59.580 that's more just after the team happened
00:21:02.100 and then trying to you know see what it
00:21:04.380 is are they are they nice to you and
00:21:06.299 don't really go hard on you because
00:21:07.860 you're their boss yeah thankfully yes
00:21:09.799 because uh it is a rough sport yeah and
00:21:13.919 I don't think I appreciate how rough it
00:21:16.320 is yeah till you know till you get out
00:21:18.780 there out there and you realize it's
00:21:21.240 it's an incredible game yeah I think we
00:21:23.700 both have really bonded and spent lots
00:21:25.620 of time together but that's a good
00:21:27.900 example of what you just asked of how do
00:21:29.760 you take and build a brand on something
00:21:31.620 right because if you take that game it's
00:21:33.240 it's always been a great game especially
00:21:34.740 from an Indian spot point of view but to
00:21:36.659 take it out of the sort of mutty and put
00:21:38.760 it on a mat right and put some lights on
00:21:41.039 them and then just one or two tweaks to
00:21:43.559 the rules of the game where every third
00:21:45.120 time you have to score versus you can
00:21:47.820 just come in and go out and not score as
00:21:50.280 change the entire perception just those
00:21:52.500 two factors have taken popularity of a
00:21:54.659 spot from X to 10x 20x no I'm intrigued
00:21:58.320 the last time Jay was in town he had
00:22:00.360 come for a kabaddi game so we were
00:22:02.100 talking about it and it seems like
00:22:05.240 the learning curve or or the amount of
00:22:09.179 money you need to set up a kabaddi game
00:22:11.400 is not as high as many other sports yeah
00:22:14.039 you don't need a stadium like cricket
00:22:15.659 and football and if you're close to the
00:22:18.600 action it it does I I see the appeal at
00:22:21.600 some level yeah
00:22:23.220 I mean in India Sports is quite
00:22:24.840 different there if you in the US you
00:22:27.419 need to own a stadium you need to own
00:22:28.860 the infrastructure here you don't need
00:22:30.539 necessarily even in cricket to
00:22:32.100 necessarily own the venue and they're
00:22:34.200 normally quite segregated
00:22:36.059 but yeah I think everybody teams become
00:22:38.820 profit making now
00:22:40.500 but it depends on how you account for it
00:22:44.159 in terms of allocated cost and how much
00:22:46.740 non-discretionary spend you are doing in
00:22:48.600 terms of are you building a youth
00:22:49.860 program are you doing scouting are you
00:22:51.900 investing in building any physical
00:22:53.940 infrastructure so maybe also Ronnie is
00:22:57.179 in Mumbai I'm in Pune his fixed cost
00:23:00.059 tends to be a little higher yeah
00:23:02.760 yeah
00:23:03.900 but right now I think we're all having
00:23:06.059 more fun than the monetary gate from it
00:23:09.299 I would say I agree would you like to go
00:23:11.520 next Jay tell us about yourself yeah
00:23:13.320 sure so first
00:23:14.960 uh fun to learn Ronnie about
00:23:18.179 you before I knew you because I only
00:23:20.340 knew you from 2014 I only know the later
00:23:23.880 stage of Irani and I Echo a lot of the
00:23:26.700 things that he said like resonate with
00:23:28.679 me uh middle class values
00:23:32.039 feeling older uh now I'm meeting and
00:23:36.000 interviewing people born in 2001 and how
00:23:39.419 old are you now I'm 89 so I'm 33. so
00:23:42.419 you're the youngest one how old you are
00:23:43.740 uh I'm 90 born wow
00:23:47.820 I'm older than both of you then yeah
00:23:49.500 come on
00:23:50.380 [Music]
00:23:51.780 um I'll have to just act yeah but but we
00:23:55.500 both were born on the same date but
00:23:57.299 considering you went to MBA or whatever
00:23:59.820 around 78 you don't look your age
00:24:03.059 right no I didn't do my MBA but yeah
00:24:05.640 yeah no I agree I would I thought you
00:24:07.799 were younger yeah
00:24:10.500 um
00:24:11.700 yeah I grew up in Mumbai
00:24:15.419 middle class values uh quite sheltered
00:24:20.280 and
00:24:22.860 dad uh founded kotak and I've been you
00:24:26.039 know privileged to watch
00:24:28.500 him and uh the business grow and that's
00:24:31.380 been a great learning experience for me
00:24:33.980 I went to the US for my studies and I
00:24:36.780 wasn't really sure
00:24:38.220 what I was going to do with my life
00:24:39.659 professionally whereas become big in
00:24:42.059 your own Journey uh
00:24:44.820 were you in school I
00:24:47.760 I it depends on big in terms of the size
00:24:51.720 of the business or our perception of it
00:24:53.520 from not your perception of it but our
00:24:56.100 perception of it
00:24:58.980 I think we became a large Capital
00:25:02.400 markets and non-bank franchise in the
00:25:04.919 early 2000s
00:25:06.299 it's about 20 years ago yes I would say
00:25:08.400 and the bank came later kotak was
00:25:10.620 founded in the late 80s and the bank uh
00:25:13.860 happened in the early 2000s around 2001
00:25:16.020 2002 so the capital markets business the
00:25:19.260 Securities business Investment Banking
00:25:20.880 was much more mature but we only became
00:25:23.100 a big b2c brand where people normal
00:25:25.559 people had debit cards credit cards bank
00:25:27.840 accounts uh in the late 2000s but
00:25:32.580 I did not perceive or understand how
00:25:35.279 large the business had become really
00:25:36.779 till I came back from undergrad in the
00:25:38.760 US in 2012 2011 2012. even then I never
00:25:43.380 actually worked at gotak till
00:25:45.419 I came back from my MBA and I wasn't
00:25:48.000 really sure that you know this was my
00:25:51.179 calling but
00:25:54.059 um
00:25:55.500 when I was taking that decision
00:25:57.779 you know three weeks before I was going
00:25:59.520 to graduate I was evaluating hey do I
00:26:01.200 want to stay in the U.S it's a pretty
00:26:03.179 comfortable life
00:26:04.380 work at a private Equity Fund or an
00:26:07.080 investment bank or a tech company there
00:26:08.760 or do I want to come back and my father
00:26:11.400 actually called me and rare that he
00:26:13.500 would do something like this and he said
00:26:14.760 I really do think
00:26:16.159 you should come back for India not as
00:26:19.380 much necessarily for kotak because the
00:26:22.080 opportunity and the way this country is
00:26:24.059 changing is a once in a
00:26:27.659 Century Century or more if you think
00:26:30.179 over the last five or six centuries this
00:26:32.640 has only happened six or seven times and
00:26:36.500 that I kind of took that plunge and I'm
00:26:39.960 I'm glad I did where did you go to
00:26:41.279 college I went to undergrad at like him
00:26:43.860 like tell us where you went to school
00:26:45.120 when you went out I went to school at uh
00:26:48.299 cathedral in John Con in school in
00:26:50.820 Mumbai and then went to college to
00:26:53.520 Colombia in New York
00:26:55.799 came back worked for a few years mostly
00:26:58.340 uh Consulting Investment Banking not at
00:27:01.200 kotak
00:27:02.220 and then went to business school I did
00:27:04.980 my MBA at Harvard in Boston I graduated
00:27:08.039 2017. and since then I've been in India
00:27:11.400 and I actually after MBA joined kotak
00:27:14.940 spent couple of years doing Capital
00:27:16.740 markets which was the original kind of
00:27:18.840 uh
00:27:21.299 strength and you know original business
00:27:23.279 of the quota group and then I moved into
00:27:26.100 consumer and b2c ever since
00:27:29.220 I remember meeting him meeting up with
00:27:31.260 you in Boston your last two three months
00:27:33.000 of Howard this thing and I remember
00:27:35.100 having that breakfast conversation with
00:27:36.900 you and you were still debating on India
00:27:40.140 or not India yeah and yeah glad you're
00:27:43.260 dad convinced you or you were on the
00:27:44.940 same page yeah you were on the same I'm
00:27:46.860 glad it's best best decision not just
00:27:49.320 for me but for anybody my generation and
00:27:51.480 I'm seeing a lot of people coming back
00:27:53.580 lot of people coming back it's a very
00:27:55.620 interesting train of thought right like
00:27:58.200 go back in time
00:28:01.740 is patriotism defined by
00:28:06.059 arbitrary boundaries drawn at one point
00:28:09.059 of time I would I would also like you
00:28:11.520 know put a caveat in here and say some
00:28:13.799 countries are more patriotic than us
00:28:15.480 like I feel like America does an amazing
00:28:18.000 job of selling patriotism so that's a
00:28:20.460 soft power approach we should not mix
00:28:22.380 that up and I'm glad you brought that up
00:28:23.880 there right because obviously
00:28:25.559 that's a soft power approach where it's
00:28:28.559 only the view from one particular side
00:28:30.480 and point of view so yeah they've done a
00:28:32.460 remarkable one-sided job on soft power
00:28:35.299 okay where you can make a movie about an
00:28:38.159 assassin that shot 123 so uh people in a
00:28:43.919 country they went and occupied but the
00:28:46.380 other person had done it from the other
00:28:47.520 side you're not going to see a Hollywood
00:28:49.020 movie on that right so whether you can
00:28:51.779 call it sniper or you can call it XYZ uh
00:28:55.440 but they've done a great job is there is
00:28:57.299 there a correlation between
00:28:59.340 how many patriotic movies are made to
00:29:02.880 the underlying patriotism in the country
00:29:04.500 soft power for America in every sense of
00:29:06.299 the world I mean there's your Silicon
00:29:07.559 Valley and there's your technology and
00:29:09.120 then there's Hollywood and yeah I think
00:29:11.520 I think
00:29:14.460 I would say cricket and Bollywood for
00:29:16.440 India are very internal insulated soft
00:29:19.740 Powers the problem is the soft power is
00:29:21.720 how you get perceived from the outside
00:29:23.279 right and here now everyone stop playing
00:29:25.679 Cricket 90 of the revenues come from
00:29:27.539 cricket in India because nobody else is
00:29:29.279 playing Cricket all the commonwealth
00:29:30.659 countries are playing more football they
00:29:31.980 do play cricket but not to that level
00:29:33.960 and I think the same applies to
00:29:35.520 storytelling I think we missed that bus
00:29:38.640 on being a global ambassador from
00:29:40.799 storytelling yeah do you think because
00:29:42.899 you both have a bird's eye view on
00:29:44.940 kabaddi do you see Cricket losing the
00:29:49.500 kind of viewership with the newer
00:29:51.000 Generations than it did in maybe for
00:29:53.460 maybe people in their 30s and 40s what
00:29:55.860 about the youngsters I don't think so I
00:29:57.960 think
00:29:59.340 there is enough space in India for
00:30:01.620 multiple Sports to coexist
00:30:03.659 and
00:30:05.159 I think Cricket is around to stay you
00:30:07.620 can never say forever if you look at a
00:30:09.360 spot like baseball for example in the US
00:30:11.220 it is on a steady kind of declining
00:30:13.380 Trend but the U.S still has four major
00:30:15.779 sports and they are for me it's more
00:30:18.240 about the fact that they emphasize
00:30:20.100 different elements of human skill you
00:30:22.260 think about a baseball that's a little
00:30:24.059 more like Cricket a basketball that is
00:30:26.820 about a height reflexes you know uh
00:30:30.840 endurance intensity American football
00:30:33.240 you'll often see some of those
00:30:34.500 footballers are fat you know and there's
00:30:37.559 a whole host of uh
00:30:39.840 different skill sets on uh football
00:30:42.120 field the act of going to a football
00:30:44.159 game is like an all-day event two hours
00:30:45.899 from the city as opposed to a basketball
00:30:47.340 game which is like going to a movie
00:30:49.679 I see the same kind of thing manifesting
00:30:52.080 itself uh in India same thing in the UK
00:30:54.840 with the rugby Cricket football
00:30:58.020 kabaddi is very different from cricket
00:31:00.299 in the kind of elements of human skill
00:31:02.760 that it emphasizes and it's a very
00:31:05.279 different viewership proposition it's a
00:31:06.899 shorter game it's a 40 minute game it's
00:31:08.520 a very high intensity 30 second uh piece
00:31:12.419 and I think that's what makes it
00:31:13.559 exciting and you can go for a kabaddi
00:31:15.480 game as a family like you would for a
00:31:17.760 movie in the evening see it and come
00:31:19.320 back right can I ask you guys a very
00:31:21.899 interesting question digress a little
00:31:24.000 bit
00:31:24.899 like when all three of you spoke about
00:31:27.779 your life your Journeys uh you brought
00:31:30.779 up the middle class upbringing the
00:31:32.820 middle class values
00:31:34.679 I'm also from a middle class family
00:31:36.360 right
00:31:37.320 uh do you think we do this
00:31:40.140 subconsciously
00:31:42.720 to Signal the perception of us we want
00:31:45.899 to be known we want others to know us
00:31:47.640 for
00:31:48.600 because we have a little bit of imposter
00:31:50.399 complex it's important yeah we do I I
00:31:52.980 would say yes but it's important part of
00:31:55.080 the narrative right because
00:31:56.720 is it a truly important part of The
00:32:00.240 Narrative of why the three of you are
00:32:02.039 successful
00:32:03.539 or is it an important part of justifying
00:32:06.899 The Narrative well two parts to that one
00:32:09.120 is it's important to be part of the
00:32:10.559 narrative because you ask the question
00:32:11.820 because we're sitting here having a
00:32:13.080 conversation which we're assuming other
00:32:14.880 people who want to gleam out of and
00:32:16.500 therefore the context is important and
00:32:18.720 second yes I do genuinely believe that
00:32:21.120 the grounding that one got and I think
00:32:23.940 when I've listened to what Jay said that
00:32:26.820 there's a there's a grounding that you
00:32:28.200 get so I think it's important to refer
00:32:30.000 to that and you're not saying it so that
00:32:32.159 you can say look once upon a time I was
00:32:34.440 here and now I'm here I don't think
00:32:35.700 that's the context can I also ask you a
00:32:37.440 question who does not want to imbibe
00:32:40.500 middle class values on their kids like I
00:32:43.799 would think most wealthy people in the
00:32:45.840 world are trying to teach their kids
00:32:48.659 middle class values in one way or
00:32:50.820 another so how are we unique or how is
00:32:54.000 that unique in each of your own Journeys
00:32:56.820 was that I pivot it out the other way
00:32:59.039 because who doesn't is a very small
00:33:01.140 minority of who doesn't because you're
00:33:03.120 talking about the top angle view I think
00:33:05.159 we're all looking in from the bottom
00:33:06.240 line and in the bottom angle of you it's
00:33:08.880 aspirational right the top angle view of
00:33:11.279 who doesn't there's a thing what is
00:33:13.500 aspirational though having middle class
00:33:14.940 values or being successful
00:33:16.860 note of the journey the journey is the
00:33:19.440 success
00:33:20.480 and more than the perception I think
00:33:22.860 it's also about the fact that I think a
00:33:25.919 lot of initial Drive comes from the fact
00:33:28.260 that like like from the fact that you
00:33:31.380 see other people having so much and you
00:33:34.559 want that now I was reading this book
00:33:36.960 called hard drive which is Bill Gates
00:33:38.159 biography and now he he was born into
00:33:41.279 money not like the kind of money he
00:33:43.140 eventually got but he still had that
00:33:45.480 passion for one thing but you know it is
00:33:48.539 you know I used to see let's say uh my
00:33:51.659 father's friends who were other doctors
00:33:53.460 and the kind of cars they would have or
00:33:55.320 the kind of you know parties they would
00:33:57.360 have Etc and see it's not perception
00:34:00.600 like so is that the innate emotion which
00:34:03.179 made you as hungry and ambitious in life
00:34:06.059 initially two innate emotions one this
00:34:09.119 and second all my friends that is a very
00:34:11.099 raw true emotion right somebody else has
00:34:13.139 more than you you guys were never
00:34:15.119 altruistic I mean my father had a maruti
00:34:17.460 800 and my chachu had a Zen and in
00:34:20.940 following that Journey where are you now
00:34:22.379 like you have x what do you compare
00:34:24.839 yourself to it no now I don't see at
00:34:27.540 some point it's a now see drive is not
00:34:30.418 black or white it's not like because I
00:34:32.520 wanted a better car I I work 16 hours a
00:34:35.159 day I could have if I wanted to make
00:34:36.659 money I could have chosen another
00:34:37.739 profession where I would work eight
00:34:39.659 hours a day and have a much more
00:34:41.339 work-life balance but I don't have that
00:34:43.020 so I think I think initial drive or for
00:34:46.080 example when I was in school all of my
00:34:48.780 friends I went to Xavier's Jaipur which
00:34:50.399 is one of the best schools in Jaipur but
00:34:51.960 all of my friends got into iits I didn't
00:34:54.679 so then during college that was the
00:34:57.900 second part of the dry that I had was
00:34:59.580 that you know there was this hunger to
00:35:02.099 prove that you know and every time at
00:35:06.300 that time it was this Gmail group and
00:35:08.280 you know you had G talk or something
00:35:10.260 like that and you would describe g chat
00:35:12.480 sorry
00:35:14.040 um
00:35:14.820 it's very surprising they should have
00:35:16.380 been the one to break out and done yeah
00:35:19.500 do you think balance is an important
00:35:22.500 part of being a successful entrepreneur
00:35:24.599 no I hate balance I think you have to be
00:35:28.500 I think balance is very important part
00:35:29.940 of anything balance tolerance little bit
00:35:32.880 you know balance tolerance completely
00:35:34.619 different balance of course it's
00:35:36.060 different I was adding to that this
00:35:37.800 thing but yeah
00:35:38.900 do you mean balance in temperament do
00:35:41.520 you mean balance and skill set no
00:35:43.500 neither I mean balance
00:35:46.460 in the repetitive nature of life let's
00:35:50.280 say he has a family let's say you have a
00:35:52.140 family do you allocate 10 hours to work
00:35:54.780 one day a weekend do you do do you have
00:35:58.020 a hobby do you go to the gym do you take
00:36:00.000 care of your health I mean balance in
00:36:02.099 that way
00:36:03.380 so I'll go first I I have always lived a
00:36:08.040 life to a point now I'm focusing on
00:36:10.140 health
00:36:11.400 but I have been a fan of this notion
00:36:13.800 that if you have to be truly truly big
00:36:16.380 and if you have to create something that
00:36:18.000 impacts creates a huge impact I hate
00:36:21.180 balance
00:36:22.320 um I mean I believe that you do enough
00:36:25.500 so that it's utility
00:36:28.099 you you figure out a way to balance
00:36:31.200 Family Health Etc but you have to go all
00:36:34.140 in if if you have to create something
00:36:36.359 truly truly truly big
00:36:38.700 uh if you have to create something very
00:36:40.920 good it's fine I think balance is fine
00:36:42.900 see right that's the generation gap I
00:36:44.640 wouldn't miss I I feel here and I might
00:36:47.099 you agree with it I I I I I think
00:36:50.640 if I look at 80 years of life I want
00:36:53.579 balance in that at your journey
00:36:56.579 and I very much agree with you on on
00:36:58.680 that piece I agree with you gaurav that
00:37:01.800 say for a two three five year period it
00:37:04.680 may not be consecutive here and there if
00:37:06.359 you feel something about a certain way
00:37:08.040 if you feel like you're creating
00:37:09.180 something
00:37:10.500 having an exciting time whether it be
00:37:12.480 professionally personal anything then go
00:37:15.480 all in on that but the sine curve has to
00:37:19.500 kind of which phase which cycle are you
00:37:21.720 in right now I'm right now in the
00:37:24.180 actually I'm in the middle of Cycles I
00:37:25.859 would say the last three years has been
00:37:27.180 a lot of uh
00:37:30.000 drill down work and all work related but
00:37:33.900 now uh I'm getting married this year so
00:37:36.180 I think that is going to necessitate
00:37:38.400 some
00:37:41.900 okay let me do like half of it and you
00:37:45.900 can do the finishing part of it nikhil's
00:37:47.940 been waiting to set this up
00:37:50.280 no I'm happy it worked out the way it
00:37:52.440 did so one day me and Jay go out for a
00:37:54.780 meal in Bombay we go for dinner
00:37:57.720 where'd we go uh I met you at Mekong
00:38:02.160 at Lands End
00:38:03.660 yeah
00:38:04.880 we were sitting on that Lobby place but
00:38:08.400 but I saw you at me at the there's a
00:38:11.460 there's a Chinese restaurant
00:38:13.099 Chinese and then we had coffee yeah uh
00:38:16.500 at the yeah uh like cafeteria Bistro
00:38:21.060 ironic by the way the food place a very
00:38:22.859 important part in all our lives
00:38:25.339 like really good food yeah so we went
00:38:28.079 from there we met one or two other
00:38:29.579 friends of mine we went to some place
00:38:32.160 nearby you know near kamla Mills it was
00:38:34.800 a lot we went to a couple of places then
00:38:37.200 we went you tell the story we went to a
00:38:39.480 couple of places we were basically going
00:38:40.980 from one place to another randomly
00:38:42.720 moving from food now to love so yeah yes
00:38:45.240 it's a random weekend in Bombay
00:38:47.700 the last place we went to is
00:38:50.880 a friend of mine his house and uh so me
00:38:55.800 and Jay Jay went there and we were
00:38:58.020 sitting and we were chatting and stuff
00:39:00.060 like that we were playing chess we were
00:39:01.859 playing chess we were playing chess and
00:39:04.560 there happened to be a girl in my
00:39:06.780 friend's house yeah okay
00:39:10.520 they talk for five minutes in front of
00:39:13.020 me they don't even exchange numbers yeah
00:39:15.020 uh cut to like a few months later Jay is
00:39:19.020 in Bangalore and we're having dinner at
00:39:21.720 home
00:39:22.560 and he's like bro I started dating that
00:39:24.359 girl yeah and that is the girl he's
00:39:27.060 getting married to now in November yeah
00:39:30.720 so I feel like you know they should name
00:39:33.320 but it's phenomenal I love it her name
00:39:36.720 is super story and it was
00:39:41.280 a butterfly effect in you know
00:39:45.119 I was tired that day I had finished a
00:39:47.880 very close friend of mine got married so
00:39:49.980 he had his Bharat his wedding it was an
00:39:52.920 early wedding and we finished by around
00:39:54.839 6 37 and nikhil was in town that day and
00:39:58.200 somewhere or the other I said you know
00:40:00.000 okay I'll spend half an hour with nikhil
00:40:02.160 and then go home and sleep because I'm
00:40:04.500 tired and we had fun and it just became
00:40:06.960 five hours and as you rightly said at
00:40:08.820 the end of that night I must have spent
00:40:11.160 two minutes with Aditi and the only
00:40:14.040 thing we got out of that conversation
00:40:15.960 was hey I did my MBA in the U.S and she
00:40:19.560 was saying I'm applying right now for my
00:40:22.440 MBA in the US so I will for you know I
00:40:26.160 really thank my Harvard MBA but I will
00:40:28.380 uh do it do it in this case because that
00:40:30.660 was something that uh is always a good
00:40:33.060 thing to say yeah uh
00:40:35.220 and then we just kept in touch on
00:40:37.079 Instagram really yeah who messaged who
00:40:39.660 first uh
00:40:41.520 she's gonna watch this in our life so I
00:40:43.380 know I'm sure she's going to kill me uh
00:40:47.220 I follow requested her she accepted my
00:40:51.240 follow request and followed me back
00:40:54.240 and
00:40:55.740 she has many more followers than me so
00:40:58.140 uh I will I felt like okay you know she
00:41:01.140 probably gets hundreds or not thousands
00:41:02.880 of uh you were still on the MBA
00:41:05.460 wavelength
00:41:07.260 uh how long has it been now it's been uh
00:41:11.700 January 2000 and
00:41:14.720 21. it's a little over two years
00:41:18.240 and uh it just went from
00:41:21.119 chatting on Instagram to hey when are
00:41:23.880 you in Mumbai next you know let's meet
00:41:27.420 interesting congratulations on the
00:41:29.520 wedding in November so thank you I
00:41:31.920 thought this group would be very
00:41:33.839 interesting uh we have one very Savvy
00:41:37.640 investor come entrepreneur come has done
00:41:40.440 everything in life from producing movies
00:41:42.240 to Media uh and how do you define
00:41:45.000 savviness because I think saviness is a
00:41:47.099 it's a nomenclature that you get into
00:41:49.920 sometimes in the world that we live in
00:41:51.720 today
00:41:52.619 my Benchmark my metric is capitalism and
00:41:56.880 through those lens
00:41:58.680 historically looking at your track
00:42:00.359 record you're very savvy Fair
00:42:03.540 uh Beauties so I'll accept it from that
00:42:06.839 point of view capitalism kind of removes
00:42:08.940 the beauty in the eye of the beholder
00:42:11.700 argument because we're all viewing from
00:42:13.260 similar lens yeah but just to complete
00:42:15.359 that often to what maybe gaurav said
00:42:17.040 earlier I can't visualize everywhere I
00:42:19.020 was getting turned off of who drove what
00:42:20.520 car yeah I think for me are you bad at
00:42:22.800 taking compliments generally in life I
00:42:24.540 just sorry like are you bad at taking
00:42:26.520 compliments in life generally
00:42:30.260 a trigger to something else why do you
00:42:32.820 think that is
00:42:34.680 my own self-conviction maybe yeah I mean
00:42:36.839 I don't know self-conviction would help
00:42:38.700 you take a compliment
00:42:41.040 I was trying to I think my I think
00:42:43.560 you're very right and very intuitive on
00:42:45.540 that maybe I'll I'll take it one level
00:42:47.280 forward that I was trying to fine tune
00:42:49.200 it even more further by actually going
00:42:51.900 to the fact that to me enjoying myself
00:42:54.240 has been has been one of the higher
00:42:56.520 parts of it because actually I'm quite a
00:42:58.619 loner in many ways I I work most of the
00:43:02.880 work of the companies that one has built
00:43:05.460 has been very interactive with people
00:43:07.040 but still in that sense but I think for
00:43:10.020 me The Benchmark of really just enjoying
00:43:13.079 what you do has been very very critical
00:43:15.119 and important and I think my journey has
00:43:16.800 been a little bit of that okay when you
00:43:19.200 do that you feel blessed when you feel
00:43:20.819 blessed you get recharged when you get
00:43:22.440 recharged you do a lot more
00:43:24.599 so in a way you think contradiction in
00:43:28.020 your mind is lesser because you have
00:43:29.520 found something you love
00:43:32.040 yeah I mean contradiction on a
00:43:33.900 day-to-day basis and balance I
00:43:36.119 understand we're always talking about
00:43:37.440 where you need to I think what he's
00:43:39.720 saying is you need to be rebellious you
00:43:40.980 need to be out of your boxing you know
00:43:42.720 what I also feel is it feels like he is
00:43:46.140 so ambitious like he thinks it's good to
00:43:48.900 be capitalistic
00:43:50.400 but somewhere he also feels it's a good
00:43:52.980 thing to be poor no but that's a good
00:43:55.200 thing to me oh why because that's your
00:43:58.560 gut you know like
00:44:00.180 see when you're talking about a smaller
00:44:01.859 unit right we grow up in families with
00:44:03.780 four people five people six people
00:44:06.420 families are always socialistic
00:44:10.800 in nature where everything is shared
00:44:13.619 when you go out in the world and Things
00:44:15.599 become capitalism and inequality
00:44:18.619 increases disproportionately some part
00:44:21.900 of our subconscious I believe because so
00:44:24.480 much of what we are today is a is a
00:44:26.280 factor of our upbringing our influences
00:44:28.140 I think some part of each of us believe
00:44:32.040 not directly but subconsciously that it
00:44:35.640 is good to be poor and I think the more
00:44:37.920 you win in capitalism the more you feel
00:44:40.260 like that it is subconscious no no I
00:44:41.760 might be wrong no no that was see that
00:44:44.099 was at the end of the day one of the
00:44:45.780 initial drives that has not been my
00:44:47.460 drive in a long time I don't today I
00:44:50.520 wouldn't compare that he has this or she
00:44:53.220 has this or something like that that was
00:44:54.900 just an initial part of the drive
00:44:56.760 eventually you know whether it's product
00:44:59.460 or content I found that thing which
00:45:01.680 motivates me and I think
00:45:03.780 um I think you're addicted to being
00:45:05.700 rebellious
00:45:07.819 maybe I know you fight every like
00:45:10.440 whatever 30 minutes and I definitely see
00:45:12.599 some spunk
00:45:14.160 which is a good thing yeah yeah I mean a
00:45:16.619 nice manner but it you're addicted to
00:45:18.839 that I mean you know half the times I
00:45:20.880 would say oh I mean and now maybe a
00:45:22.800 little bit I follow you because we've
00:45:24.060 met couple of times I'm saying now why
00:45:25.980 does he have to shoot his mouth off
00:45:27.599 again but I think you enjoy it and
00:45:31.020 that's that defines the character
00:45:33.180 so for us I mean for us it was the fact
00:45:36.300 that who has made it big in the Venture
00:45:37.980 Capital game and and to be tagged as a
00:45:39.960 unicorn I mean when we were 25 years old
00:45:42.119 me Roman and himesh one of the goals was
00:45:44.880 that you know if we can make a unicorn
00:45:46.859 before 30 that would be awesome and it
00:45:49.140 did happen meaning convince four or five
00:45:51.000 people to give you a lot of money at a
00:45:52.859 higher value but that was that's what it
00:45:54.599 would mean right but unlike some other
00:45:56.579 companies our company has also created
00:45:59.160 value so yeah but essentially that yeah
00:46:01.680 I'm just I'm just I'm just curious about
00:46:04.200 that I'm I'm not I'm not I'm I'm very
00:46:06.720 happy with my announcing but I'm trying
00:46:08.460 to because I think it's the messaging
00:46:11.280 that we all do in a conversation is very
00:46:13.140 important so I get it I mean if I were
00:46:15.780 to look and I'm half Charming you so
00:46:17.220 don't get it
00:46:18.480 if if I were to look back should I have
00:46:21.060 changed valuation the way I did probably
00:46:22.980 not but it did teach me a lot of things
00:46:25.200 and at some point you know an academy in
00:46:27.480 the last 12 months the way we have
00:46:29.280 focused on a better I think very few
00:46:31.680 Venture funded companies have and this
00:46:33.660 month will be the first month where we
00:46:35.640 are cash flow positive so I think that
00:46:37.680 Journey wasn't easy but uh That's a
00:46:41.280 hardcore capitalistic talk now but one
00:46:43.319 thing I have to add in gaurav's defense
00:46:46.500 is what he's saying that valuation game
00:46:48.780 he was not the only one playing it you
00:46:50.700 know like millions of people
00:46:52.680 who wanted to achieve what he achieved
00:46:55.500 so regardless of Market cycles and when
00:46:59.520 money drains out and interest rates go
00:47:01.380 up I think a lot of credit goes to him
00:47:05.400 for having been able to
00:47:08.460 get that money scale an academy in the
00:47:10.859 manner that he did and I think he should
00:47:12.599 take pride in that and always yeah no I
00:47:15.900 would I would be a little humblier and
00:47:18.540 say that there was only one feedback
00:47:21.420 that shailendra and dependra and bhaven
00:47:23.819 these three people are have been good
00:47:25.740 mentors and they've built companies they
00:47:27.960 have helped build companies they kept
00:47:30.359 saying that don't let your ego come in
00:47:31.980 between so I just I was just
00:47:34.920 I accepted the reality but there were 10
00:47:38.040 people who told me what to do so I just
00:47:40.800 didn't let it get into my head that or
00:47:43.260 just because I like I could convince
00:47:44.940 five people to Value me at a certain
00:47:46.920 valuation doesn't and and by the way
00:47:49.680 this happens with a lot of other
00:47:51.060 Founders
00:47:52.619 um rest how to execute or you know how
00:47:55.200 to do that Etc I think that was the easy
00:47:57.060 part but listening and having that
00:47:59.700 acceptance that you up or you
00:48:03.240 over hired people
00:48:04.640 and the journey of letting go of people
00:48:07.560 would be a tough one so I think doing
00:48:09.660 that acceptance was the major part once
00:48:13.500 you accept that hey I did
00:48:17.040 there are 10 people who will tell you
00:48:18.839 you have to reduce your fixed cost you
00:48:20.579 have to reduce your SNM you have to
00:48:22.140 reduce your GNA and then uh and and then
00:48:25.740 we promulgated but that's all that
00:48:27.660 matters bro as long as you guys have
00:48:30.119 course corrected
00:48:32.220 in a direction that will make you bigger
00:48:35.700 better stronger in the future I mean see
00:48:37.980 at the end of the day we all wish each
00:48:39.599 other the best rate yeah yeah so where I
00:48:43.260 was at before this conversation is we
00:48:45.660 have one very very Savvy person because
00:48:48.420 he has done so many things we have a
00:48:51.119 very articulate friend of mine Jay who
00:48:53.579 has gone to the best colleges in the
00:48:55.140 world and gotten great marks and not
00:48:57.480 really how much do you get I was always
00:48:59.839 how did you how did you get into Harvard
00:49:02.220 I was a good student yeah uh I was a
00:49:04.380 very good student but I was not uh I
00:49:06.420 wasn't always in the top 10 not in the
00:49:08.940 top one percent
00:49:10.200 in all of my classes that's the
00:49:11.940 Benchmark because you come up and not in
00:49:13.380 the top ten percent no but in typically
00:49:16.200 you know there is this kind of culture
00:49:18.960 in India that like you have to have 99
00:49:20.579 or 98.
00:49:22.680 I was always 89 90. uh kind of
00:49:27.960 which is good and then we have another
00:49:29.400 engineer who has done so well and you
00:49:31.859 have me who has not gone to college is
00:49:33.720 fairly illiterate from the traditional
00:49:35.819 lens
00:49:36.660 so putting four people like us together
00:49:39.359 right like one who doesn't have any
00:49:42.060 education one hour one like
00:49:45.060 so much experience and so many other
00:49:46.980 things also with very little education
00:49:48.780 but you went to college you said I did
00:49:50.940 my bcom and that was it yeah so you're
00:49:53.460 saying that's that qualifies your four
00:49:55.319 years more than I did and
00:49:57.839 30 we all come together and we talk
00:50:00.300 about education overall not just for
00:50:04.319 everybody looking to build a product a
00:50:07.200 company in education
00:50:09.200 any kind of a business ancillary to
00:50:12.000 education I thought four diverse views
00:50:15.180 like this should help an entrepreneur
00:50:18.119 starting off today so that's the intent
00:50:20.099 of today
00:50:21.180 and it's not about our individual
00:50:23.640 companies it's not about how well anak
00:50:26.520 Academy is doing or upgrad is doing or
00:50:28.560 kotak bank is doing codec bank is
00:50:32.160 is in another level where I don't really
00:50:34.140 I don't think we should not be
00:50:36.240 commenting about it yeah is not so I
00:50:39.359 can't take a remote credit for that I'll
00:50:40.980 only take credit for a little bit of
00:50:42.599 kotak 811 inside Bank kotak bank is
00:50:45.300 could not will you elaborate on that a
00:50:47.280 little bit because we'd like to know
00:50:48.300 what Jay is doing at 811
00:50:52.640 uh 811 stands for
00:50:56.000 interestingly given the news that
00:50:57.839 happened yesterday 8th of November uh
00:51:00.480 which was the date of demonetization
00:51:02.099 where we as a traditional slash Legacy
00:51:06.180 Bank
00:51:06.980 started a
00:51:09.300 immediate online account opening which
00:51:11.460 is never allowed before that along with
00:51:13.260 demonetization a set of new interesting
00:51:16.200 and very Progressive regulation came
00:51:17.880 that allowed bank accounts to be open
00:51:20.099 for the first time without a wet
00:51:21.480 signature so kotak started a product
00:51:25.079 called Kota k811 that basically allowed
00:51:28.319 that to happen and it saw
00:51:30.920 extremely high uptake because it turns
00:51:33.839 out that
00:51:34.859 a lot of India was and to a lesser
00:51:37.500 extent still is not banked or
00:51:39.839 underbanked and
00:51:41.940 that has been a journey
00:51:44.040 and recently we've seen the scale of
00:51:47.579 that opportunity we've uh
00:51:49.859 in a management segregation not a legal
00:51:51.960 entity segregation very important
00:51:53.400 because regulatory businesses have to be
00:51:56.160 uh carved it out as a bank and Bank
00:52:01.020 management segregation and we think of
00:52:03.540 ourselves a little more as a digital
00:52:06.000 Bank slash
00:52:07.440 fintech but you know fully regulated
00:52:11.880 business that's nice and it took that
00:52:13.920 eight I mean it's eight eleven but you
00:52:15.960 call it eight one we call it so it's one
00:52:18.599 and 911 they couldn't have called it 911
00:52:21.059 otherwise would have been the emergency
00:52:22.020 example in America right so not that
00:52:24.180 most people in India have no no concept
00:52:26.760 of 9-1-1 tell us what 811 does broadly
00:52:29.640 like if you had to categorize it in a
00:52:31.260 bucket
00:52:32.520 you can open a bank account in three
00:52:34.079 minutes sitting in your living room on
00:52:35.819 your phone it's a partial kyc account
00:52:37.740 and you get a virtual debit card you can
00:52:39.960 start transacting immediately so element
00:52:42.480 one of the proposition is that it's uh
00:52:45.359 fully you know straight through we do
00:52:46.859 around
00:52:47.819 uh six lakh accounts a month so they
00:52:50.640 will take 20 000 or a day which is
00:52:52.800 considerably so 811 now contributes
00:52:55.260 seventy seventy to seventy five percent
00:52:56.940 of the total accounts that quota Gobles
00:52:59.000 uh and that's just the power of digital
00:53:02.099 and why I'm in Bangalore so much the
00:53:04.319 second element of the value proposition
00:53:05.700 is that we are an unbundled offering
00:53:07.980 think of it like how Indigo disrupted
00:53:10.680 Jet Airways we have zero balance we are
00:53:13.440 the only large Bank in India to offer a
00:53:16.079 bank account with zero minimum balance
00:53:17.700 which is very compelling for most of
00:53:19.859 India that does not have ten thousand so
00:53:21.839 would you like summarize and say it is
00:53:23.880 banking focused on the young in a fast
00:53:26.880 efficient
00:53:28.319 near zero cost manner
00:53:31.079 yes I guess that's a good way to
00:53:33.839 summarize it the one thing I have to add
00:53:35.579 like you know especially for a very
00:53:37.260 underbanked Nation yeah the one thing I
00:53:39.660 have to add about Jay is before the
00:53:42.180 story about him meeting is now to be
00:53:44.579 wife and all of that
00:53:46.920 the very first time I met Jay is when I
00:53:50.460 had gone to the kotak bank office where
00:53:53.099 Jay was sitting and pitched their family
00:53:56.339 a product which would a product of ours
00:53:59.099 which would manage a part of their money
00:54:01.319 and this was a few years before that and
00:54:04.680 uh
00:54:05.760 I will say this about Jay right
00:54:08.280 a lot of people look at
00:54:12.300 people who are popular
00:54:13.940 personalities kids and
00:54:17.099 make up preconceived notions in their
00:54:19.200 mind
00:54:19.980 but
00:54:22.500 Jeff was refreshingly different he is
00:54:25.500 not
00:54:27.200 somebody's son alone but Jay on his own
00:54:31.800 is extremely impressive uh like for the
00:54:36.599 for the first I don't know how many
00:54:37.800 times we met he would never even like
00:54:40.140 mention his dad once or you know that
00:54:42.780 he's the son of this person he owns this
00:54:44.579 bank and all of that
00:54:46.079 and I hope personally because we have a
00:54:50.280 relationship and you know whatever
00:54:52.440 I hope that one day when that
00:54:54.720 opportunity comes uh I hope that
00:54:57.780 opportunity comes to Lead kotak Bank but
00:55:01.619 I can't think of somebody who has more
00:55:05.099 you know natural ability he so calm
00:55:07.859 stable uh has so many facets which would
00:55:11.640 serve well
00:55:13.040 in leading a institution of that size
00:55:15.720 yep couldn't agree with you Mom yeah so
00:55:17.640 I appreciate that but yeah
00:55:21.300 um
00:55:26.000 it's not just about regulation it's it's
00:55:28.140 a large business we are 26 shareholder
00:55:30.960 yeah there are 74 other
00:55:33.059 and uh leadership and future has to be
00:55:37.020 decided in the context of what is best
00:55:38.880 for all I am committed in what I'm doing
00:55:41.880 right now and of course by virtue of
00:55:43.800 being uh the largest shareholder we are
00:55:48.420 aligned with the future of the business
00:55:50.160 but for me I don't see that as a
00:55:52.920 necessary do you think he's not taking
00:55:54.300 compliments well either like you asked
00:55:56.280 me no I I think this is he's taking it
00:55:59.760 better than you I must say because you
00:56:01.680 have like this aversion where you
00:56:03.000 rejected blanket but he's trying to like
00:56:06.059 you know incorporate another facet he's
00:56:08.040 adding to it I don't agree with a lot of
00:56:09.839 your compliments because I do think that
00:56:12.140 uh this is the best compliment of them
00:56:14.819 all no not that you're not agreeing with
00:56:16.319 my compliment it's
00:56:18.119 having a head start from being born in
00:56:22.380 what was when I was much younger I was
00:56:24.900 you know we were not very affluent but
00:56:27.059 still you know privileged uh parents
00:56:28.980 that value your education being able to
00:56:31.200 send you to an American school and not
00:56:33.119 have to worry about scholarship uh you
00:56:35.880 know not having to worry about paying
00:56:37.680 Education Loans and that kind of sets
00:56:40.980 off a positive cycle right that
00:56:44.400 definitely kind of uh is a is an unfair
00:56:47.300 Advantage so to speak that I've had
00:56:50.220 that's a good way to come back to this
00:56:52.079 they say that
00:56:53.819 what was the number of somebody was
00:56:55.440 telling me 40 to 50 percent
00:56:57.720 of school going children in India go to
00:57:00.900 private schools
00:57:04.020 if Government schools in their form
00:57:06.960 today
00:57:09.240 don't function do you think that is a
00:57:11.160 testament to how they don't function
00:57:13.619 as to how they have to change the very
00:57:15.240 fact that 50 of India and we are talking
00:57:18.000 about India where you know like maybe
00:57:21.420 three four percent of our country pays
00:57:23.400 tax so that 50 is not affluent which is
00:57:26.760 taking the additional hassle of paying
00:57:29.460 school fees and the expenses and all of
00:57:31.980 that sending their children to private
00:57:35.160 schools does that talk about public
00:57:38.339 schools in a I wouldn't say that okay is
00:57:41.700 that number true I'm not sure about the
00:57:43.680 number but I'll just say it in two parts
00:57:45.180 firstly I think the U.S by the way the
00:57:47.220 school the schooling is not so great I
00:57:49.260 was going to say exactly yeah there's
00:57:50.760 enough people to come back from the US
00:57:51.960 in the fifth standard yeah and here
00:57:53.880 we'll have to go in the third standard
00:57:55.260 right so that should give you a pretty
00:57:57.300 quick Benchmark on that and look we
00:58:00.599 worked with about 1200 schools in rural
00:58:02.460 India and I can tell you since you're
00:58:03.839 bringing that when this
00:58:05.480 is what you would call the the schools
00:58:08.579 but I think there is a sense of
00:58:11.400 infrastructure that also pulls it down
00:58:12.900 it's not just that it's the faculties
00:58:14.460 the teaching and whatever else you go
00:58:15.960 there but I can tell you when we started
00:58:17.940 opening a library in each of the rural
00:58:20.640 schools magic happened the attendance
00:58:22.800 went from 60 to 95 that's yes but that's
00:58:27.240 one single situation of opening a
00:58:29.339 library because for most people the
00:58:30.720 library was a locked cupboard behind the
00:58:33.720 principal's door was a key which nobody
00:58:35.819 had access to and you couldn't take away
00:58:37.140 a book home right so if you look at the
00:58:39.960 singular paths what are the triggers of
00:58:41.880 what people do because at the end of the
00:58:43.500 day it's about aspiration right I mean
00:58:45.119 education is about growing aspiration
00:58:47.400 what do you think is tomorrow going to
00:58:49.200 be brighter and better than yesterday
00:58:50.760 and I think we spoke a little bit
00:58:53.579 earlier about uh patriotism in India I
00:58:56.520 mean I can best say that today people
00:58:58.380 are thinking very genuinely that
00:59:00.059 tomorrow is better than yesterday and I
00:59:01.980 think the soft part that America went
00:59:03.540 through was exactly that that softball
00:59:06.359 gave you the sense that tomorrow is
00:59:08.160 going to be better than yesterday I
00:59:09.420 think today the United States is
00:59:10.740 reviewing um
00:59:12.000 they may not want to admit it but
00:59:13.619 they're reviewing whether tomorrow is
00:59:15.059 better than yesterday for them right and
00:59:17.040 if you just look at that as one and I
00:59:18.599 know I'm straying from your specific
00:59:20.099 question on that but
00:59:21.720 I think you have to look at education
00:59:23.760 now or anything to do with learning with
00:59:25.680 that little bit broader perspective than
00:59:28.440 just attendance just learning just
00:59:30.720 grading private versus public
00:59:33.420 and I think it's all about teachers
00:59:35.460 right in many sense of the word right is
00:59:37.559 that the opportunity the two of you saw
00:59:40.020 the quality of Education
00:59:42.720 in government
00:59:44.940 or private in or some private
00:59:46.920 institutions as far as upgrad was
00:59:48.299 concerned I think we are in higher
00:59:49.500 education so I didn't think we didn't
00:59:50.940 look at the K-12 market for for a
00:59:53.280 multiple of reasons you also gave us
00:59:55.319 like 30 seconds on what upgrad does and
00:59:57.599 I'll come to you next yeah so I've ever
00:59:59.880 sort of Define it I think education is a
01:00:02.520 very calendar event and it's a very
01:00:04.140 preconceived notion where you go through
01:00:06.420 a certain portion of your life and it's
01:00:08.099 over and I think we want to disrupt that
01:00:10.260 space in today's for us the definition
01:00:12.540 of what we want to build is a sort of a
01:00:15.240 book called learning Skilling and a
01:00:16.859 Workforce Development company and do you
01:00:19.619 also skill people who are already
01:00:21.119 working yes in fact most of the people
01:00:23.339 we skill have to be in some sense of a
01:00:26.819 job in working and the earliest we do as
01:00:28.859 College Learners or the last year of
01:00:30.540 college people so you take people in
01:00:32.520 when they're 18 19 that kind of age
01:00:34.319 groups we don't take but they come to us
01:00:36.299 but yeah
01:00:40.980 no see the beauty about technology and
01:00:43.920 online is it's amazing because you don't
01:00:46.140 do a pull you don't do marketing
01:00:47.700 advertising as much no for two reasons
01:00:49.920 one is it's an option at that stage you
01:00:52.380 know that's why the calendar event it's
01:00:54.599 not an option it's programmed in your
01:00:56.040 life you have to go to school you have
01:00:57.480 to go to college or you're going to be
01:00:58.440 called a Dropout or you're less
01:01:00.119 privileged but here the optionality of
01:01:03.000 Life Starts and therefore I think it was
01:01:04.859 more we're talking about the fact that
01:01:06.660 optionality starts there right because
01:01:08.819 that's the time when you need to carry
01:01:10.079 on and take it Forward right how is an
01:01:12.180 academy different
01:01:13.799 so an academy is
01:01:15.720 I don't internally also we don't think
01:01:17.819 we are in the education business we
01:01:19.200 think we are in this tournament business
01:01:21.119 so what happens is today whether it's 60
01:01:24.240 million people give these competitive
01:01:27.119 examinations you have your UPS you have
01:01:29.520 your need you have J
01:01:31.859 and
01:01:33.180 for a huge
01:01:35.099 like for almost everyone who comes to 11
01:01:37.500 standard or 10 standard the only way to
01:01:40.619 change their socio-economic status is by
01:01:43.500 getting selected into these examinations
01:01:45.119 because I I like to think that uh and
01:01:48.480 and this is what similar to
01:01:51.000 um
01:01:51.540 but upgrad also does is it helps people
01:01:53.640 get better jobs makes them better
01:01:56.040 skilled so I think that's are you both
01:01:58.740 at the same price point in a way no but
01:02:00.660 we are in different markets very
01:02:01.799 different very different similar price
01:02:03.660 points uh no no no which would be higher
01:02:07.559 and lower no no so so you know be it
01:02:09.900 cater for SSC examination where uh
01:02:12.420 annual subscription would cost 5000
01:02:14.280 rupees but we have a j examination where
01:02:17.099 an annual subscription would cost 1.2
01:02:19.079 lakhs so we are sort of in that
01:02:21.480 tournament business where let's say if
01:02:24.480 people get selected and they go into an
01:02:26.700 IIT
01:02:27.660 their life will change IIT is like a
01:02:30.720 lottery you say tournament because so if
01:02:32.280 you get in yes it's fair to call it a
01:02:34.079 lottery though no I'm not calling it a
01:02:35.640 lottery I'm calling it a tournament yeah
01:02:37.380 like we do in India game of skill
01:02:39.960 no no no but it's not a I mean you I
01:02:42.839 mean the kind of people who end up
01:02:44.640 qualifying and the kind of uh questions
01:02:47.040 that come in these examinations I mean
01:02:49.380 we can debate that is this the right way
01:02:51.720 to measure Etc but we have to all agree
01:02:53.579 to some way of measuring a person's
01:02:56.400 ability and if uh hard work is by the
01:02:59.460 way I couldn't clear any of those
01:03:00.599 examinations if people don't know but I
01:03:02.700 got rejected by a coaching Center in
01:03:05.280 Jaipur there was this coaching Center
01:03:06.599 called resonance where there was this
01:03:08.940 teacher Ashish Arora who eventually
01:03:10.920 joined an academy uh two years ago but
01:03:14.940 I my father takes me to the coaching
01:03:17.520 Center and they rejected me because uh
01:03:21.240 to get into that teacher's batch you
01:03:24.839 have to clear a test which I couldn't
01:03:26.099 clear so one of the things that an
01:03:28.079 academy now does is and some of our
01:03:29.819 teachers are paid a million dollars
01:03:31.319 million US Dollars we got the best quota
01:03:34.200 and Jaipur teachers and they would start
01:03:36.660 teaching at ten thousand or twenty
01:03:38.099 thousand people paid a million dollars
01:03:40.079 that's why he started by saying venture
01:03:42.059 capital is that the difference no no by
01:03:45.180 the way
01:03:46.380 I think without Venture Capital nobody
01:03:48.119 gets paid a million dollars
01:03:50.420 these teachers
01:03:52.460 never getting paid similar amounts by
01:03:56.220 offline coaching centers who
01:03:58.260 collectively were doing 20 000 crores in
01:04:00.119 Revenue so between chaitanya between
01:04:02.700 Allen between Akash and between narayana
01:04:05.040 and I don't want this to become the
01:04:07.200 rameshwaran cafe type
01:04:09.839 shocked but between these four coaching
01:04:12.240 centers these do twenty thousand
01:04:14.099 corrosion Avenue and there are let's say
01:04:16.140 some of these coaching centers would
01:04:17.460 have at least 40 50 teachers who get
01:04:20.579 paid more than two crores per annum and
01:04:22.319 some of them can I interject funds is
01:04:25.500 that the differentiation why one ethic
01:04:28.619 platform works over another quality of
01:04:30.540 teachers is it syllabus is it teaches
01:04:33.119 but again see you need to do this
01:04:34.920 segment it would be different I mean for
01:04:37.079 me and for the overall working
01:04:39.180 professional it's a lot of plus plus
01:04:41.220 it's not necessarily teachers and
01:04:43.859 faculty which is the epicenter is it the
01:04:45.780 syllabus like if you had to pick one at
01:04:47.819 upgrad would you say syllabus have more
01:04:49.980 weightage or do teachers do no I think
01:04:52.680 learning experience and the whole
01:04:54.180 process of learning because it's online
01:04:55.980 is the most important part of it and
01:04:58.079 connecting otherwise I mean just a
01:05:00.000 lecture today is not going to move the
01:05:01.920 needle from All Points of View if you
01:05:03.480 have just have a TED Talk that's not how
01:05:05.099 you're going to learn for the next level
01:05:06.359 of what you want to basically do right
01:05:07.980 so I think that is the pivotal part so
01:05:10.020 for us learning experience
01:05:12.059 right now to me what I think is going to
01:05:14.099 revolutionize learning is peer-to-peer
01:05:17.160 learning so while we are talking about
01:05:19.079 teachers and faculty
01:05:21.059 I can see that Trend in the next five
01:05:23.160 years the power of everything that's
01:05:24.660 going to go to the next level and maybe
01:05:26.099 not in school because you do need that
01:05:27.960 basic element you can't start any app
01:05:29.640 peer-to-peer is peer-to-peer learning I
01:05:32.099 actually wanted to ask Jay that question
01:05:33.540 because I agree with this yeah did you
01:05:36.240 go to Harvard because the teachers were
01:05:38.940 good and after you went to Harvard did
01:05:41.940 you learn more from your teachers or
01:05:43.619 your classmates so Harvard is actually a
01:05:46.260 Harvard Business School is a very
01:05:47.700 interesting kind of education model
01:05:49.380 because it is a combination of teacher
01:05:53.280 to student and peer-to-peer because
01:05:56.000 every class is almost like a conductor
01:05:59.280 with an OP to an orchestra where the
01:06:00.960 conductor is only kind of which is the
01:06:02.579 professor he gives you a case everybody
01:06:04.799 has to read it before the class you
01:06:06.299 assume everybody's read it it's usually
01:06:07.920 a very interesting case on a topic based
01:06:10.680 on what the class is and they have you
01:06:12.299 know millions of cases and then the
01:06:14.640 professor
01:06:15.720 has a road map of what he or she wants
01:06:18.660 to get out of that discussion but he
01:06:20.520 pushes different members of the class
01:06:22.220 and because it's a very diverse class
01:06:24.780 like for example on a case where you're
01:06:27.359 talking about Disney the media company
01:06:29.119 there was a girl who was a child actress
01:06:32.579 who became a very successful child
01:06:35.039 actress and then a media executive
01:06:37.200 and then came to Harvard Business School
01:06:38.940 and had an interesting perspective to
01:06:40.740 share
01:06:41.579 with the rest of the class and likewise
01:06:43.500 on other topics that's to me I learned a
01:06:46.680 lot more what was most valuable was it
01:06:49.799 the network the classmates and what you
01:06:52.680 learned of them or was it the teaching
01:06:55.079 staff like for him it would be different
01:06:58.559 than for what it would be for a normal
01:07:01.740 person
01:07:03.299 no I I disagree no no but because the
01:07:06.000 normal person is going there for an
01:07:07.500 intent to eventually get a very high
01:07:10.200 paying job in Harvard I don't think I
01:07:12.180 don't think no I don't think so no that
01:07:14.160 wouldn't necessarily be there I think
01:07:15.599 that uh that's normally a given by the
01:07:18.299 time I think that for most people
01:07:21.059 they already have some form of
01:07:24.240 reasonable paying job before they come
01:07:26.220 for an MBA because in the U.S unlike in
01:07:28.440 India you don't do an MBA right after
01:07:30.299 your undergrad it's usually anywhere
01:07:31.859 from three to six years of work
01:07:33.359 experience and because the school is so
01:07:35.940 selective these folks tend to have gone
01:07:38.520 to iits or you know very good schools
01:07:43.099 so the intent is to go
01:07:47.280 to up level yourself into being a
01:07:49.859 business leader and to being a more
01:07:53.700 well-rounded professional and person but
01:07:56.039 so what I had heard and maybe you can
01:07:58.799 correct me if I'm wrong
01:08:00.859 the most sought after jobs after after
01:08:03.839 somebody completes HPS or private Equity
01:08:06.299 firms hedge funds uh Venture capitalism
01:08:10.700 you're the youngest is a lot but you're
01:08:12.720 10 years you're 10 years behind I would
01:08:14.400 say I graduated six years ago and it had
01:08:16.920 already started to change so what is it
01:08:18.540 entrepreneurship uh
01:08:21.000 software product management
01:08:22.979 yeah you're you're hanging around too
01:08:24.960 much with the investment bankers
01:08:25.979 management of course there is a large
01:08:28.620 cohort of people that are going into
01:08:30.960 private Equity that are going into
01:08:32.279 Investment Banking there is always you
01:08:33.779 know those are important pillars but
01:08:35.279 even there it's with an entrepreneurial
01:08:36.420 mindset and there it's within most
01:08:38.460 people do that as a hey none of that
01:08:40.080 career mindset but so you are
01:08:41.759 essentially saying that people are going
01:08:44.100 into HPS to become entrepreneurs but if
01:08:47.399 you see the people who are like I don't
01:08:49.319 think we should single it out in an hist
01:08:50.939 manner all of these kind of uh like you
01:08:54.600 and nikhil mentioned I mean you became
01:08:57.120 entrepreneurs because of who you were
01:08:58.859 and not because of the education no no
01:09:00.779 no no no not at all it was the same
01:09:02.759 human emotions greed yeah hunger
01:09:05.640 insecurity exactly and not because of a
01:09:08.640 college education no no it's not an
01:09:11.100 education as much as is that it's an
01:09:13.259 immersion into a pool of very
01:09:16.140 interesting people and you go as a
01:09:18.238 sponsor the question I was asking you is
01:09:20.460 that your biggest takeaway from that
01:09:22.080 hands down as a leader you need to be a
01:09:24.660 great Catalyst and I think what you just
01:09:26.279 defined is the network is a phenomenal
01:09:28.738 Catalyst you know their ability too and
01:09:30.479 you know coming back to we were talking
01:09:32.339 about kotak being a a a large company
01:09:35.359 and we're very small if we compare to
01:09:38.460 truly large companies uh you know around
01:09:40.979 the world and one of the things I see
01:09:43.560 looking at that and looking at us and
01:09:45.779 larger companies is that
01:09:47.698 the skill sets you need is so much more
01:09:50.580 about people managing people leadership
01:09:54.000 motivation uh and I can say that just
01:09:56.940 from the outside and I've interacted
01:09:58.739 with many people but I've interacted
01:10:00.480 with them for 10 and 15 years and the
01:10:02.640 continuity of that culture that is there
01:10:05.100 right comes from somebody being a
01:10:07.620 phenomenal Catalyst that is therefore
01:10:09.960 sprouted enough owners within an
01:10:12.480 organization so there's an interesting
01:10:14.160 question for the two of you if
01:10:17.040 the biggest USB of colleges I will I
01:10:20.760 let's not pick on Harvard let's say IV
01:10:22.620 colleges in the US for example Ivy
01:10:25.080 League colleges
01:10:26.340 is the network the connections all of
01:10:29.580 that
01:10:30.480 occur there can attack where you learn
01:10:35.219 through a medium without human
01:10:37.320 interaction with your peers in a way
01:10:39.360 ever truly compete with that
01:10:41.880 the vision for us is to be inclusive the
01:10:45.060 vision there is to be exclusive so the
01:10:47.820 two different tracks
01:10:49.580 it's a much larger experience for a
01:10:52.380 larger set of people but do you think
01:10:54.659 larger I mean much larger but do you
01:10:56.640 think this can compete with that so let
01:10:58.800 me let me just give you an example
01:11:01.440 so we have products for people ranging
01:11:04.560 from 17 year olds to 29 30 year olds
01:11:07.020 there is this examination people prepare
01:11:08.699 for called neat PG if you became a
01:11:10.860 doctor and you want to do your
01:11:11.820 postgraduate post graduation
01:11:14.640 um and get your md Etc you give this
01:11:16.500 neat PJ examination
01:11:18.600 now
01:11:19.679 the younger you are you need more
01:11:22.620 coaching you need more intervention you
01:11:24.300 need somebody to call you and tell you
01:11:25.800 please study you need more discipline
01:11:30.080 market share the problem there is people
01:11:32.520 say we don't need offline coaching
01:11:34.140 centers and even if you give them great
01:11:37.800 content but boring content
01:11:40.080 they will open the app because they
01:11:42.480 intent so high they will study it
01:11:44.580 without even building social
01:11:46.860 interactions
01:11:48.300 so if your question is on whether this
01:11:51.719 can be done
01:11:52.860 that you don't need let's say without a
01:11:55.260 network Etc can you build that that
01:11:57.480 depends on how much Intel what are you
01:11:59.820 building
01:12:01.260 at this point
01:12:03.420 the government of India has or even some
01:12:06.540 private institutions have these
01:12:08.699 tournaments if you crack these
01:12:10.440 tournaments uh your life changes we are
01:12:13.380 coaches of that tournament now
01:12:15.600 and and no I'm I'm totally with you up
01:12:18.179 until here whether you need to compete I
01:12:21.719 think it and that was your real question
01:12:23.880 the firstly I'm saying let's say let's
01:12:26.400 say education
01:12:27.960 is a priority is a precursor to having a
01:12:31.860 certain kind of individual a certain
01:12:34.199 kind of 30 year old man for example
01:12:35.940 which is also changing yeah that's also
01:12:38.280 true yeah yeah there's no longer that
01:12:40.739 formal context has not got the same
01:12:42.420 weightage that it had before I
01:12:45.020 agreement that you mean the degrees Etc
01:12:47.820 yeah part of that is experience part of
01:12:50.219 that is
01:12:51.360 for the lack of a better word somebody's
01:12:53.940 motivation to learn on their own so I
01:12:55.980 think many skill sets today to be job
01:12:57.540 ready yeah very different yeah but do
01:13:00.120 you think
01:13:01.860 a person who takes this medium
01:13:05.340 I'm talking about using upgrad using an
01:13:07.980 academy clearing a certain exam uh
01:13:12.300 if education was online if the
01:13:15.000 distribution of Education they're not
01:13:16.620 going to a college eventually they're
01:13:18.360 consuming all of the education online
01:13:20.580 through a medium through a device can
01:13:23.460 that compete or compare with real life
01:13:26.159 education if I'm competing in terms of
01:13:28.140 outcomes and I just want to say that
01:13:29.520 what am I competing on if I'm competing
01:13:31.140 in terms of final outcome report card
01:13:33.300 being outcome absolutely right
01:13:35.280 absolutely because you're visualizing a
01:13:37.260 brick and mortar space and and I'm
01:13:39.900 visualizing a a surreal space and if I
01:13:43.440 and people who operate in all spaces
01:13:45.179 today yeah I think the outcome I'm
01:13:46.679 looking for is not necessarily Mark's
01:13:48.659 card do you do you have you it's not
01:13:50.340 necessarily Mark Scott yeah it's success
01:13:52.500 in life yeah absolutely and and if your
01:13:55.199 question is more about online do you
01:13:57.360 know about Roblox
01:13:59.400 so there is an app called Roblox in us
01:14:02.360 every kid between 6 to 16.
01:14:06.380 like one in every three kids spend more
01:14:09.540 than two hours on the app so it's a
01:14:11.520 metaverse gaming metaverse where you can
01:14:13.199 play games with your friends Etc
01:14:15.480 that is now replacing some of the
01:14:18.120 offline experiences so you can go to an
01:14:21.060 amusement park with your friends and
01:14:22.920 it's a mobile app it's not a VR headset
01:14:24.900 you can go to an amusement park with
01:14:27.780 five of your friends have social
01:14:29.699 interactions and then there are these
01:14:31.739 game developers which are building
01:14:32.940 experiences
01:14:34.260 so my belief is that if you have
01:14:38.100 built that or what Minecraft has done if
01:14:41.040 you have built those kind of experiences
01:14:42.900 and you are seeing kids addicted to
01:14:45.480 those experiences and they are doing
01:14:46.980 experiences online it's actually
01:14:48.900 interesting I saw this on an Elon Musk
01:14:50.820 interview he said it's easy to get kids
01:14:54.000 to play video games the question is can
01:14:56.940 you tweak the video games just enough
01:15:09.020 the reason why that's a great learning
01:15:12.120 medium is you don't need an intermediary
01:15:13.679 you don't need that one pontiff you
01:15:15.900 don't need somebody on the pulpit right
01:15:17.580 and then Roblox is exactly peer-to-peer
01:15:19.739 yeah a game developer developed a
01:15:21.900 chemistry lab experience that if you mix
01:15:23.640 these two things a reaction will happen
01:15:25.440 you go there with five of your friends
01:15:27.600 and you are doing experiences you can
01:15:29.940 also collect virtual selfies Etc and
01:15:32.100 you're posting there so I think like
01:15:34.500 that will happen and if you have to
01:15:36.659 crack online education you won't say
01:15:38.219 that I will have boring content is that
01:15:40.380 the next big thing in online education
01:15:42.060 make it big there is no big things in
01:15:44.219 life you have to make them big so the
01:15:45.900 next thing
01:15:47.179 I mean this is
01:15:49.400 consistent yeah I'm telling you that
01:15:53.400 it's not about whether it's time is
01:15:54.960 arrived you're gonna make its time
01:15:56.040 arrive from that perspective and it's
01:15:57.960 absolutely ready to be there so if I'm
01:16:00.480 uh so the only thing about thing is
01:16:02.219 acceptance or open-mindedness when you
01:16:04.080 look at these two things and I think yes
01:16:06.120 and and my belief is that you have to
01:16:08.040 make some
01:16:10.199 you know I wrote this blog post long
01:16:12.120 back about
01:16:13.560 good addiction products like how some of
01:16:16.260 the best minds of the world are working
01:16:17.640 on GTA or FIFA or you know making every
01:16:21.000 experience or Instagram so addictive
01:16:23.580 yeah but some of the best finds are not
01:16:25.679 working on education being super
01:16:28.199 addictive
01:16:29.280 so once why is why is GTA FIFA Etc
01:16:32.400 addictive and by the way that's recorded
01:16:34.440 content so if you can make recorded
01:16:36.540 content multiplayer so addictive you can
01:16:38.820 do that with education why why is it
01:16:40.380 addictive and why is education not what
01:16:42.360 needs to change gamification like like
01:16:44.640 if you you know there's this game called
01:16:47.280 Jailbreak on Roblox
01:16:48.960 simple game super simple Graphics but
01:16:51.540 one is the social aspect element of it
01:16:53.760 the second is the gamification element
01:16:55.560 of it
01:16:56.940 um if you read this book called
01:16:58.080 actionable gamification it breaks down
01:17:00.659 every single aspect of why you get
01:17:02.520 addicted to a game
01:17:04.739 you people play games that they win
01:17:08.100 so today if they are sitting in a
01:17:10.620 coaching Center where you don't even get
01:17:13.679 entry to a best teacher's class because
01:17:15.960 they say you are number hundred that
01:17:18.480 won't work but if there is an AI app
01:17:20.880 that says that so the AI app can
01:17:23.699 actually say that Nicole you want to
01:17:25.080 learn this it can real time generate a
01:17:28.140 lesson for you by the way this is not
01:17:30.060 happening but we have to make it happen
01:17:32.340 and can start giving you questions so
01:17:34.620 basically and they have to give you some
01:17:36.120 positive reinforcement because if you
01:17:37.920 start playing if FIFA only had
01:17:40.020 world-class mode and then have a amateur
01:17:43.199 mode you would never play FIFA that's
01:17:45.360 right this is a sharp word but I think
01:17:47.520 if you look at I mean I come from a
01:17:49.320 media background so I think storytelling
01:17:51.300 is a very important aspect of what Hooks
01:17:54.179 you on right and I think I mean the very
01:17:56.820 fact that that same narrative is coming
01:17:58.380 there is because there's a storytelling
01:17:59.940 element to that conference and that's
01:18:01.980 why that's why some of our top Educators
01:18:03.659 work absolutely if you see that that's
01:18:05.400 the ability if you see their classes
01:18:07.260 yeah
01:18:08.340 um
01:18:09.179 and I think when Jay gave the example of
01:18:11.040 this young girl who came in she was a
01:18:12.420 child artist and whatever else we look
01:18:13.980 at that
01:18:14.760 you know and it stuck with him yeah it
01:18:16.679 stuck with him in that element of a
01:18:18.239 storytelling and I think if you can
01:18:19.679 bring that element to your learning and
01:18:23.520 hold on to people's attention so I'm
01:18:25.860 thinking like I'm thinking in the manner
01:18:28.020 that a 24 year old starting a business
01:18:30.540 and a tech would think today so I need
01:18:33.480 to incorporate peer-to-peer
01:18:35.600 gamify the experience in some manner and
01:18:39.120 storytelling has to be a more integral
01:18:40.980 part of it is
01:18:43.159 a very important thing because all of
01:18:45.239 this if you don't figure out therefore
01:18:46.739 what's the end thing because what do you
01:18:48.420 think the outcome should be see because
01:18:49.500 in school there's a defined outcome
01:18:51.000 either it's in March or you move from
01:18:52.440 one standard to the other so there's a
01:18:54.000 calendared event that's done there here
01:18:56.340 you have to set your own benchmarks for
01:18:58.620 that and it is road to to some sense of
01:19:01.860 success entrepreneurship or job
01:19:04.500 enablement to move forward in your
01:19:06.840 career it's as simple as that yeah that
01:19:08.640 definitely it's simple do you think our
01:19:11.400 current benchmarks
01:19:13.320 are not well placed to cope with the
01:19:15.900 changes that are happening like
01:19:17.820 education makes in my view I'll give you
01:19:20.580 my experience of Education right
01:19:22.800 I went to a terrible school I hated my
01:19:25.260 school hated my teachers
01:19:27.840 grew up being scared of things I should
01:19:30.420 not have been scared of I was probably
01:19:31.800 scared of my class class teacher this
01:19:34.199 teacher that teacher
01:19:36.480 stopped going to school beyond the 10th
01:19:39.060 I didn't go I started working and stuff
01:19:40.679 like that but
01:19:42.600 what I remember of school is it taught
01:19:47.040 me to be conformist
01:19:49.920 in a manner where their idea of what I
01:19:54.000 should be their idea of what I should
01:19:56.280 learn
01:19:57.179 their idea of what is required to get
01:20:00.719 the outcome we just spoke about being
01:20:02.520 job success entrepreneurship whatever
01:20:06.179 that was met but that idea seems to be
01:20:09.120 changing
01:20:10.320 very quickly in the world I don't think
01:20:12.719 you become successful 10 years from now
01:20:15.719 by being conformist anymore
01:20:18.420 so my my view on that is that the
01:20:21.239 definition of school is also changing
01:20:22.800 for example if you ask an 11th or 12th
01:20:25.320 year 12th standard student
01:20:27.600 especially if they're not preparing for
01:20:29.699 test prep or if they are because of
01:20:30.960 their parents had so if you truly ask
01:20:32.699 them what they want to be
01:20:34.800 being a YouTuber would be a like a lot
01:20:38.040 of people would say they want to be a
01:20:39.239 YouTuber yeah yeah and and why why does
01:20:41.880 that work or a social media celebrity of
01:20:44.040 some kind and I think that cycle is
01:20:46.140 turning no no but why that works is you
01:20:48.540 need to realize YouTube is sort of like
01:20:50.100 a school with instant gratification and
01:20:52.800 which is non-linear at school you could
01:20:55.380 get x marks on YouTube If you crack
01:20:57.900 something you can get like 500 000 marks
01:21:00.900 in a way you know that those are the
01:21:02.400 kind of views that we get so that's why
01:21:04.560 I also start thinking that
01:21:06.540 if people eventually want to play
01:21:08.880 non-linear games
01:21:10.860 these platforms that have opened up
01:21:12.840 there there are 15 year old kids who are
01:21:15.300 making games on Roblox there are there
01:21:17.820 is a kit one of the most a YouTuber who
01:21:21.179 owns fifth largest YouTuber in the world
01:21:23.460 who earns the most money is a kid who
01:21:25.380 reviews toys
01:21:26.820 and he makes like 30 million dollars so
01:21:29.100 what are you saying about education so
01:21:30.780 we are saying school no what I'm saying
01:21:32.400 teaches you to be too conformist so what
01:21:34.380 what I'm saying is that YouTube in a way
01:21:36.900 has become sort of like a parallel
01:21:39.960 school right people might not start when
01:21:42.480 they are in school you think that's the
01:21:43.679 future more democratized peer-to-peer
01:21:45.960 education I don't think schooling we
01:21:47.460 should be in our lifetimes also forget
01:21:49.860 mine
01:21:51.020 it's not going to get disrupted to that
01:21:53.760 level why and I'm and I'm not saying
01:21:55.560 that will be if it does it'll be at that
01:21:57.300 very top one percent I agree with it
01:21:59.219 it's not going to get this I think and
01:22:01.020 actually in some ways it shouldn't I
01:22:03.360 agree with that it needs to be why
01:22:05.699 because you need to layer you need to
01:22:07.679 build on situation one of the reasons
01:22:10.140 where I reached where I reached was
01:22:12.000 because I found YouTube yeah I didn't
01:22:15.060 crack any examinations yeah so if you if
01:22:17.520 you see what are these tournaments
01:22:20.520 one tournament is that in a traditional
01:22:22.679 fence if you become good at physics
01:22:24.239 chemistry maths and you crack that
01:22:26.400 examination I think that's powerful but
01:22:28.980 I couldn't I went to a college which had
01:22:31.860 too much fees where the best job you
01:22:34.020 could get was in one of these IIT
01:22:35.460 services companies three and a half
01:22:37.440 lakhs
01:22:38.580 and there was no way I wanted to get
01:22:40.560 that job not saying that's a bad job but
01:22:42.540 that's not that was not for me so in a
01:22:45.659 way
01:22:46.679 and and this is why I think upgrad and
01:22:50.280 higher ed needs to change
01:22:58.560 how do you change that no okay if you if
01:23:00.900 you didn't go to a good college how do
01:23:02.460 you change that and I think YouTube is
01:23:04.560 one way upgrade me if I can get a good
01:23:07.440 degree and that gives me exposure that's
01:23:09.960 one way so what I'm saying is that think
01:23:13.380 of a kid who didn't crack let's say top
01:23:16.320 three top three percent of kids get into
01:23:18.239 these good colleges
01:23:19.800 what about the 97 they go into these
01:23:22.800 engineering colleges in let's say tier
01:23:24.840 two tier three cities
01:23:26.340 their job placement rate is two percent
01:23:28.739 five percent ten percent
01:23:32.280 so they their capability is there but
01:23:35.640 they don't get the exposure
01:23:37.500 but is that a problem that there are not
01:23:39.840 enough jobs or is that a problem that
01:23:42.060 they're not well enough educated both
01:23:44.340 see education doesn't solve for exposure
01:23:49.040 you know why people prepare for upsc
01:23:51.480 examinations there is a friend of mine
01:23:53.520 she gave the upsc examinations four to
01:23:55.500 five times extremely smart friend
01:23:58.140 I'm like you gave the examination five
01:24:00.600 times why because of the predictability
01:24:03.540 okay once I crack it I will get this
01:24:07.620 wealth or this status or this
01:24:09.600 credibility or my father would give me
01:24:11.880 validation
01:24:13.260 so at the end of the day
01:24:15.600 you know it take I mean it takes a lot
01:24:17.940 of years for you to come out of the
01:24:21.000 shell that was created for you Etc and
01:24:22.800 you are always seeking that validation
01:24:24.239 but and this is my question to all of
01:24:27.179 you think of a kid and this is huge
01:24:29.820 chunk of our population the kid does not
01:24:32.100 crack a good examination the kid goes to
01:24:34.739 a average college
01:24:37.260 the college does not give get the kid a
01:24:39.480 job what does he or she do but that's
01:24:42.120 changing in many ways I feel like one
01:24:44.820 more light because I think people look
01:24:46.080 at a broad topic like we are about
01:24:47.760 changing a job it's quite Universal and
01:24:50.880 we won't draw the best examples and
01:24:52.920 inspiration for the people who are kind
01:24:55.260 of listening to this unless we take a
01:24:56.640 little bit more of a Global Perspective
01:24:57.960 without being just completely Global
01:24:59.400 correct and Global does not mean the U.S
01:25:01.199 because
01:25:02.100 Africa Vietnam some other markets like
01:25:06.000 that very very very unique and different
01:25:07.920 but if you take the cluster of all of
01:25:09.659 that together you'll actually find some
01:25:12.600 very clear parallels that actually can
01:25:15.300 make you give you so I think I just
01:25:16.679 wanted to put that into perspective that
01:25:18.960 some of the challenges on a Country-Wide
01:25:21.060 basis is not going to be able to solve
01:25:22.739 but if you put a lot of those
01:25:24.000 perspectives you can have a bigger
01:25:25.679 solution and then it'll start applying
01:25:27.420 to a lot of stuff yeah I'm going to keep
01:25:28.739 everything a little more concise mindful
01:25:30.659 of time but I would like to you know
01:25:34.080 maybe add here that today companies like
01:25:36.600 Facebook Google Tesla even us here in
01:25:40.199 India
01:25:41.219 we don't care about educational
01:25:43.440 qualification in the manner that once we
01:25:45.719 once did yeah like we don't ask for
01:25:47.880 people to tell us what qualification
01:25:49.199 they have I have not hired anybody ever
01:25:51.659 looking at their degree in their mouth I
01:25:54.060 think that's a sliver at the top in more
01:25:56.460 evolved parts of our job ecosystem I
01:25:59.340 think the moment you go one level down
01:26:00.719 you being an IIs officer or being an IIT
01:26:03.060 grad absolutely matters but I have a
01:26:05.639 separate question
01:26:07.199 if the system was good and the test was
01:26:10.500 meritocratic in the right set of ways
01:26:13.199 and everybody had equal opportunity
01:26:15.780 what's wrong with the test
01:26:18.000 or a way that kind of
01:26:21.360 tells folks who are looking to hire that
01:26:24.360 from this pool this is the most capable
01:26:26.880 I agree it's not where it is right now
01:26:28.620 and that's where you know a lot of
01:26:29.760 that's all has to do but I think the
01:26:31.679 test is good I'm talking about folks
01:26:34.080 yeah but capable is the key word so I
01:26:36.480 think you know today more and more we
01:26:39.360 are now hard driving those ones what is
01:26:42.239 capability what is Readiness what is
01:26:44.100 whatever else what are you at the cusp
01:26:46.620 of so I think that all those are
01:26:48.780 changing which is why I still believe
01:26:49.980 there are some fundamental things that
01:26:51.960 need to be built on but yeah just for
01:26:56.100 the sake of disrupt everybody creates a
01:26:57.900 little bit more chaos what skill set do
01:26:59.639 you need to Ace these tests
01:27:02.280 and is that relevant to you doing the
01:27:05.340 job excuse for us here it's very
01:27:07.739 sophisticated word I mean I call them
01:27:09.179 super skills and I don't even call them
01:27:10.739 soft skills yeah because I just realized
01:27:12.659 as a marketing person that as soon as
01:27:14.940 you add shaktimaan to something then
01:27:16.620 there's a little bit more attention
01:27:17.820 right so you say super skills versus
01:27:19.320 soft skills obvious sounds very soft
01:27:21.239 yeah super sounds I've already like more
01:27:23.699 important situation the soft skills yeah
01:27:26.340 the higher up you go in terms of
01:27:29.420 metaphorically the success ladder which
01:27:31.560 is a crude way of putting it soft skills
01:27:34.080 becomes more important indeed super
01:27:35.400 skills but you are a product of soft
01:27:36.659 skills yeah I'm a product of soft skills
01:27:38.820 what does that mean otherwise after 10
01:27:41.219 standard if you haven't done it what
01:27:42.659 else would have got you through life it
01:27:44.760 is your it is those soft skills it is
01:27:47.159 that super skills that you manage to
01:27:49.020 build on to that start with it whatever
01:27:51.120 else through a background through a
01:27:52.800 financial whatever else and you built on
01:27:54.780 it no matter but don't do this
01:27:56.340 realizing it civilizing the issue to
01:27:58.800 like for example or shining the light on
01:28:01.139 it okay I mean yes I mean trivializing
01:28:04.020 it by saying is it so simple yeah we are
01:28:06.960 but I think when you really find big
01:28:08.940 Solutions when you simplified not when
01:28:10.440 you complicate it I agree things like
01:28:12.179 empathy things like leadership are and
01:28:16.320 the ability to kind of
01:28:18.480 be with seven people that have different
01:28:20.460 backgrounds and Lead that team or you
01:28:22.260 know figure out what motivates who is a
01:28:24.840 very different skill than solving an
01:28:27.480 extremely complicated alphanumeric five
01:28:29.340 years back if I was looking to back a
01:28:31.199 founder of hire somebody which is as a
01:28:33.600 partner with me I would say problem
01:28:35.280 solving skills is important today I'm
01:28:37.199 saying spot the problem before you can
01:28:39.000 solve it because I'm not looking for
01:28:40.260 problem solvers anymore right I'm
01:28:41.880 talking about problems spotters I'm
01:28:43.260 looking for the guy who looks around the
01:28:44.580 Ben and sees is the train going to hit
01:28:45.960 me or the truck going to hit me right
01:28:47.400 and not somebody's going to solve it
01:28:48.900 because even that time and density we
01:28:51.719 don't have right it makes sense see if I
01:28:53.699 take a simplistic View
01:28:55.679 my belief is that
01:28:58.020 everyone is collecting these Badges and
01:29:00.659 these credentials which is what
01:29:02.400 education is about
01:29:04.260 now
01:29:05.340 if somebody takes an online degree from
01:29:08.280 upgrad
01:29:09.840 degree
01:29:11.219 that's a badge because some like like I
01:29:13.980 was talking to a SVP of mine and his
01:29:17.340 wife had taken an upgrad course
01:29:19.860 I asked him why did she take that
01:29:23.719 she said he said that for her the moment
01:29:27.239 she put that on her LinkedIn profile
01:29:30.000 suddenly she started getting more
01:29:31.800 requests
01:29:33.060 so in a way what test prep is also doing
01:29:36.000 is you're collecting these badges
01:29:40.800 I have this degree I went to this
01:29:42.840 college or I have so many subscribers so
01:29:46.139 or I built this game which was played by
01:29:48.900 so many people
01:29:50.280 in a way I like to think that that's
01:29:52.260 what education is becoming about on how
01:29:55.080 and and then you can say that
01:29:58.080 our system currently is limited
01:30:00.739 available but
01:30:03.840 what online can solve foreign
01:30:08.659 is not that different it is an inclusive
01:30:11.219 medium because
01:30:12.900 exclusive is a problem here I have to
01:30:15.540 get a test prep to get into IIT exactly
01:30:18.060 perfectly fine phenomenal world out
01:30:20.159 there but hello with 10 billion people
01:30:22.800 in the world right now 8 billion going
01:30:24.540 to 10 billion people right so obviously
01:30:27.060 that opportunity of being very
01:30:28.440 Democratic on what we want to do is
01:30:30.000 gonna happen it's gonna have to change
01:30:31.440 quite radically I think education has to
01:30:33.840 solve for so one part of it is the badge
01:30:36.300 gets you into the room with the
01:30:37.679 recruiter and the HR and then you know
01:30:39.300 the job
01:30:40.380 the far bigger challenge is once you're
01:30:42.600 in the job how are you good at it are
01:30:44.820 you good at it because there's only so
01:30:46.860 much that you can you know I think I
01:30:48.900 think I think the opposite is true I
01:30:50.880 think today getting into the room is a
01:30:53.100 bigger challenge people are still there
01:30:54.719 are like if if like for example nikhil
01:30:57.480 said that they don't look at the IIT tag
01:30:59.520 if you don't look at that tag there are
01:31:01.380 still great people a bigger challenge
01:31:02.880 for who and when sure for 20 for 18 to
01:31:06.179 23 year olds probably and yes it is a
01:31:08.580 challenge because there are not that
01:31:09.960 many jobs which is a separate problem to
01:31:12.420 solve but being good at something
01:31:14.940 anything
01:31:16.320 is very important and education should
01:31:18.600 be solving for
01:31:20.580 how to make people passionate about
01:31:22.860 things without using the word education
01:31:24.960 because again you get back into a little
01:31:26.340 bit
01:31:27.139 yeah it's very unstructured that's not a
01:31:31.020 education issue that's a motivation
01:31:33.120 issue
01:31:44.120 you do need you do need that prompt you
01:31:47.040 need the prompt sheet you need that from
01:31:48.659 sheet you need that hack you need that
01:31:50.460 element my belief is and we we can agree
01:31:53.940 to disagree here instead of Bottoms Up
01:31:56.699 the top-down approach works
01:31:58.620 and that's how people think for example
01:32:00.840 for that
01:32:02.100 um person who bought that upgrad course
01:32:03.900 it was like I want a job and this
01:32:06.840 particular product helps me get more
01:32:09.239 exposure so I think it starts from the
01:32:11.639 fact
01:32:14.600 that's why I want to crack an IIT
01:32:17.340 examination and that's why if you I I
01:32:20.400 was on a flight and I was seeing you
01:32:22.679 know Indigo or vistara magazine
01:32:25.739 every single College ad now had
01:32:28.440 placements with amount of packages
01:32:31.380 people were getting yeah because I think
01:32:33.659 is
01:32:37.860 because I'll I like to believe that it's
01:32:40.860 not oversimplication but it's the
01:32:42.780 reality okay
01:32:44.460 if you say that you will get X after
01:32:47.520 doing y
01:32:48.840 then people are more motivated so I
01:32:51.179 don't think it's a education issue I
01:32:53.280 think it's a motivation issue
01:32:55.320 yeah and it's not maybe it's not an
01:32:56.880 either all so I don't think it's about
01:32:57.900 us disagreeing or agreeing in that
01:32:59.400 context because it's such a it's such a
01:33:01.800 massive Challenge and such a massive
01:33:03.239 opportunity frankly but but do you think
01:33:05.940 that would anybody learn anything for
01:33:08.100 the sake of learning for example yeah
01:33:09.900 yes yeah
01:33:12.139 that's myopic I think maybe absolutely
01:33:14.520 Society has kind of conditioned us into
01:33:16.560 that but can I tell you like personal
01:33:18.239 example
01:33:20.159 my initial phase of learning was based
01:33:22.500 out of insecurity
01:33:23.940 I didn't go to school I didn't go to 11
01:33:25.860 standard 12th standard all my classmates
01:33:28.560 did
01:33:29.699 that insecurity drove me to learn but
01:33:32.639 another selection by SPS see where there
01:33:34.800 is also a lot of selection biases
01:33:37.760 we talk about any product that has no
01:33:40.860 not selection bias but where I'm getting
01:33:42.659 to today is
01:33:43.920 I've stopped reading the kind of stuff
01:33:46.080 that I read back then which will help me
01:33:48.239 be better at a job yeah and today I keep
01:33:50.520 reading about history and psychology and
01:33:53.100 philosophy and these things I do not for
01:33:55.739 a job this is just because I find them
01:33:58.500 but I think that stuff does help you be
01:34:00.840 wetter yeah in life and job is part of
01:34:03.600 life yeah in terms of identifying you
01:34:05.400 just want to be more rounded every
01:34:07.440 single day of your life to simplify it I
01:34:10.440 read it because I enjoy it but
01:34:13.260 but again I would say that's like a very
01:34:15.960 very small subset of the population but
01:34:18.780 I think more more of the population has
01:34:20.820 to move there and yeah
01:34:24.179 that I agree that how do we because
01:34:26.159 otherwise we'll get stuck at the entry
01:34:27.780 gate yes we're not at the Gate of Heaven
01:34:29.520 yeah we're going to try and experience
01:34:31.139 the whole thing so all I would say is
01:34:32.820 you're right at the entry gate but
01:34:34.920 there's much more than the entry gate
01:34:36.360 and I think we might be all saying the
01:34:38.219 same thing but at different positions
01:34:40.080 the root of this is at some level
01:34:41.760 something you said maybe five minutes
01:34:42.960 earlier but you said education and
01:34:44.280 exposure are different
01:34:45.900 to me I think if I think about education
01:34:48.900 as a lifelong process exposure is an
01:34:51.780 integral part of Education that becomes
01:34:53.760 a larger piece of that pie it just
01:34:56.040 depends on what the context of education
01:34:57.840 is here if we're talking about education
01:34:59.460 in the context of
01:35:01.020 companies solving for a piece of the
01:35:03.900 value chain to make profit then it's
01:35:05.760 probably a different education than a
01:35:07.440 you know more abstract idea
01:35:10.080 yeah I mean this conversation we are
01:35:12.000 having is a is a learning curve of some
01:35:14.280 way I mean I I keep being not wanting to
01:35:17.100 use the word education because the
01:35:19.260 perception comes back into a little bit
01:35:20.760 about formal structure part exactly yeah
01:35:22.800 and and I get two hours if I can pick up
01:35:25.620 three nuggets and go away I'm not gonna
01:35:27.179 remember the whole two hours of the
01:35:28.380 conversation
01:35:30.120 like digress this conversation into
01:35:32.340 another place altogether
01:35:34.080 let's say
01:35:35.820 the world evolves
01:35:37.679 tomorrow
01:35:39.179 a lot of the jobs get replaced by
01:35:41.520 computers and so on and so forth
01:35:44.280 there are not enough jobs in the world
01:35:47.340 to immaterial of house kill the person
01:35:49.920 applying for the job is let's say that
01:35:52.199 equilibrium is not met world
01:35:55.159 transforms into some kind of
01:35:58.739 socialism but by choice capitalism right
01:36:03.179 like Thomas spaghetti spoke about donate
01:36:05.699 economics where we're in Equanimity with
01:36:08.400 nature in a way growth for the sake of
01:36:10.380 growth is not good let's say Universal
01:36:12.120 basic income is there yeah Ubi is there
01:36:14.580 people are getting paid
01:36:16.620 people to not then have global warming
01:36:18.960 will come in sooner than that one if you
01:36:21.120 ask me here I I personally uh like I
01:36:24.840 know a lot of people are very critical
01:36:26.280 of global warming like we have a big fun
01:36:28.620 rain matter climate we do a lot of uh
01:36:31.739 work around climate change
01:36:33.960 I tend to be more sanguine about it
01:36:36.840 in many ways when I look at the world
01:36:38.880 today I feel we are the luckiest we have
01:36:42.659 the best version of the world any of our
01:36:45.360 ancestors ever did we live for 40 years
01:36:48.600 longer than we lived 100 years ago we
01:36:51.239 didn't have to see world wars we didn't
01:36:53.040 have to see racism we didn't have to see
01:36:55.980 uh disease malnutrition all of this in
01:36:59.400 the manner that our predecessors had to
01:37:02.520 uh so sure global warming is a problem
01:37:04.920 we have to work on it we have to like
01:37:06.780 you know work on negating the effects of
01:37:09.719 climate change
01:37:11.040 but
01:37:12.860 notwithstanding that
01:37:15.000 I think in the future if Ubi were to
01:37:17.400 come in
01:37:18.960 I feel the kind of learning that we are
01:37:21.360 talking about will become the only kind
01:37:23.460 of learning where people choose to learn
01:37:25.679 a certain thing because they want to
01:37:28.380 learn it totally I agree yeah yeah and
01:37:30.179 to get on with what they want to do with
01:37:31.620 life absolutely and that that to me is
01:37:33.600 the is the fun part of it it's a
01:37:35.580 limitless and this is living like if you
01:37:38.820 go back 2000 years ago
01:37:40.800 philosophy was not something
01:37:43.560 people spent like a ancillary subject
01:37:46.139 like the Greek way of living philosopher
01:37:48.480 today's Turning inwards is giving you a
01:37:50.880 much different depth and that's why I'm
01:37:52.560 saying therefore let's not Tinker with
01:37:54.480 the opening part of what we keep saying
01:37:57.360 that all of this can only happen if you
01:37:58.980 go back to the foundation yeah sure yes
01:38:01.380 of course we can teach sex education
01:38:03.300 better in school we can teach
01:38:05.340 entrepreneurship we can teach
01:38:06.659 competitive virtue of where the world is
01:38:08.520 going maybe sex education yeah suddenly
01:38:11.040 has become
01:38:12.600 a very meta thing we need people to have
01:38:14.820 more kids all over again so yeah we're
01:38:16.679 doing pragmatic again maybe sex
01:38:19.199 education
01:38:20.420 look at that that context where you're
01:38:22.860 moving in because of your other
01:38:24.060 exposures in life and that's why I was
01:38:26.100 saying there's a certain cost to an
01:38:28.260 event let that be there because it's
01:38:30.719 evolving in itself but I think the
01:38:32.820 important part that we brought up here
01:38:34.199 also was are there going to be that many
01:38:36.120 jobs and therefore what's everyone's
01:38:37.440 doing in this entire space to be able to
01:38:39.300 do that and water does find its level of
01:38:42.600 course it goes through troughs in many
01:38:44.760 ways but water does find its own level
01:38:46.500 in many ways hopefully I wouldn't say
01:38:49.739 hopefully that's the wrong word for it
01:38:51.840 likely there would also be lesser people
01:38:54.420 in the future I think the value of
01:38:56.639 everything formal I wouldn't be able to
01:38:58.800 survive and create opportunities but
01:39:00.480 because I'm gonna have this informal
01:39:02.520 approach to a situation the more
01:39:04.320 likelihood I'm going to succeed in an
01:39:06.120 environment which is fragile yeah and
01:39:08.639 unpredictable because actually today
01:39:10.199 what I think the next 100 years is going
01:39:13.080 to face is much more fragility much more
01:39:15.480 uncertainty I'm not sure as a student of
01:39:18.239 History
01:39:19.320 um I think that there's enough
01:39:20.520 historical Parables to say that this is
01:39:22.679 indeed what is happening but I my
01:39:24.179 personal instinct is I believe in
01:39:25.620 capitalism I believe in our ability to
01:39:28.199 solve problems in the context that I
01:39:29.940 actually don't think either
01:39:32.159 we're going to run out of jobs yeah
01:39:34.260 because I think that for every job that
01:39:36.060 gets taken away for sure new jobs are
01:39:38.040 coming and it's been happening for the
01:39:39.300 past 100 years was more that extremes of
01:39:42.060 extreme negative extreme positives may
01:39:44.159 become a little bit more polarization
01:39:46.020 may happen to a a larger extent but I
01:39:48.659 fully agree I'm not a pessimist on the
01:39:51.060 fact that we're going to run out of jobs
01:39:52.260 also on climate change which is the one
01:39:54.300 that maybe we disagree yeah I think yes
01:39:56.400 there will there will be an impact yeah
01:39:58.139 I think we all agree on science and all
01:40:00.300 of that but we will solve when it
01:40:03.179 becomes okay there is precedent for that
01:40:06.060 right like we solved the ozone layer
01:40:07.739 issue yeah the world together did we
01:40:09.780 yeah yeah
01:40:11.219 you remember like 10 years ago everybody
01:40:13.020 was like ozone ozone ozone layer hole in
01:40:15.120 the ozone layer nobody talks about it
01:40:16.620 more than our control because we were
01:40:18.780 creating it and therefore we could
01:40:19.980 control it couldn't you also argue
01:40:21.659 climate change we're creating yeah it
01:40:23.340 can it could it could but it's a little
01:40:26.340 bit in that space But I think what will
01:40:28.920 happen before this climate change
01:40:32.120 inevitability that a lot of people
01:40:34.080 prophesize is I think jio engineering
01:40:37.920 will become such a big field in itself
01:40:39.780 like if we were to like very simply talk
01:40:42.780 about climate change right Sun hits
01:40:44.460 Earth its surface reflects a certain
01:40:46.739 kind of heat pack yeah it gets trapped
01:40:49.139 in the atmosphere Albedo effect
01:40:51.360 based on what gases are in the
01:40:53.100 atmosphere that much heat does not go
01:40:54.659 out but things like adding sulfur into
01:40:58.560 the stratosphere technology around
01:41:01.199 covering the ice caps with some form of
01:41:03.780 limestone
01:41:04.940 geoengineering in itself
01:41:07.440 like everything else like if you've been
01:41:09.239 resilient as humans for hundreds of
01:41:11.460 thousands of years I don't see why in
01:41:15.480 that minute 67 years that we are around
01:41:18.179 will the world collapse in front of my
01:41:20.400 eyes mathematically the odds of that to
01:41:22.800 me are meniscus collapse maybe not
01:41:25.260 deteriorate could be but the world's
01:41:27.900 always changing yeah I agree I agree did
01:41:31.380 you do it as a very relative world like
01:41:33.300 if you talk about relative to the
01:41:35.400 previous hundred years we should be
01:41:36.900 happy with where they are now yeah and
01:41:39.119 hopefully 100 years down the line we are
01:41:40.920 there and we're coming back to a topic
01:41:42.780 that we were talking here I'm saying
01:41:44.280 therefore in that environment it's even
01:41:46.860 more that you need that flexibility
01:41:48.480 versus the formality of it yeah so what
01:41:51.000 we are saying to summarize the last bit
01:41:53.040 of our conversation
01:41:55.380 what needs to change about education or
01:41:58.320 what people looking to build around
01:42:00.719 education need to bear in mind
01:42:03.320 is the near future
01:42:06.360 could be a time of increased
01:42:08.940 gamification
01:42:11.880 changing
01:42:13.980 not replacing the bricks of Education if
01:42:17.880 we were to consider it a wall
01:42:19.920 but a lot of tweaking of the bricks to
01:42:22.800 make it less conformist in the manner
01:42:26.520 where your ability to regurgitate
01:42:29.340 information is not as valuable as it was
01:42:31.619 20 years ago that change will likely
01:42:34.020 happen and people need to bear that in
01:42:35.639 mind
01:42:36.659 and another point you brought up
01:42:38.760 if peer-to-peer will become increasingly
01:42:41.639 relevant like Jay also said going to
01:42:45.420 Harvard is as much about the other
01:42:47.639 people who went with him to Harvard then
01:42:50.400 it is about syllabus teachers teaching
01:42:54.300 stuff yeah in the interest of time
01:42:56.820 moving on you brought up by juice for a
01:42:59.580 second would you like to because it's
01:43:01.320 all over the news if you guys have an
01:43:03.480 opinion like would love to hear it since
01:43:05.340 you're both in the space no I think I
01:43:08.280 don't have a particular opinion on
01:43:09.659 bedroom but I will make a more generic
01:43:11.820 statement I think what has happened is
01:43:14.219 that any new employee I'm interviewing
01:43:16.260 any new investor who comes and talks to
01:43:18.480 me there is this sort of negativity
01:43:20.400 about edtech
01:43:21.900 and the people who are in edtech know
01:43:25.139 that it's a phenomenal sector
01:43:27.179 I mean the kind of pools Revenue pools
01:43:30.119 that it has whether it's in higher
01:43:32.159 education or in test prep or in K-12
01:43:34.080 it's amazing I mean I was giving you the
01:43:36.600 example that the top 10 offline coaching
01:43:39.780 centers of the country do 20 000 crores
01:43:41.940 in Revenue annually
01:43:43.679 but if you don't even go top 10 if you
01:43:45.960 go localized
01:43:47.280 in madhya Pradesh there is an exam
01:43:49.679 called mppsc there is a coaching Center
01:43:53.219 six or seven Institutes
01:43:55.440 that help people prepare for that
01:43:57.480 examination does 150 crores a year and
01:44:00.840 there are hundreds of such examples so
01:44:03.239 that Revenue pool exists offline you can
01:44:05.760 bring that online similarly in higher
01:44:07.739 education whether any kind of college
01:44:10.080 that helps people getting get better
01:44:12.420 skilled or get a better job there is a
01:44:15.179 huge opportunity to disrupt don't take
01:44:17.040 this from a perspective where
01:44:20.580 somebody is comparing one company with
01:44:22.739 another it is not about an academy it is
01:44:28.639 where do you think as a cycle every
01:44:32.280 stock every sector has Cycles so if you
01:44:36.060 were to paint the cycle like this where
01:44:38.100 do you think edtech is it right now very
01:44:40.560 simple concise answer I think in covert
01:44:42.480 we were at the peak and then uh last
01:44:45.780 year I think at least for us we would
01:44:48.000 say that we were going through a lot of
01:44:49.920 tough times now we are climbing back up
01:44:52.560 right now and and that's more an academy
01:44:55.139 and I can't say for others but that's
01:44:57.179 what we are yeah look there is no this
01:45:00.600 at all because the opportunity and what
01:45:04.080 the need is is absolutely massive the
01:45:07.500 there's a Revolution going on in
01:45:09.000 reskilling today there's a dire need for
01:45:10.860 it it's like a Clarion fall in many ways
01:45:13.560 so there's no opportunity for anything
01:45:15.840 to go up and down here when we look at
01:45:18.000 this up and down we only categorize it
01:45:20.040 in terms of uh investment bankers or
01:45:22.980 valuation which are so irrelevant
01:45:24.780 capital is not going to change learning
01:45:28.139 Skilling and and and ten times more
01:45:30.960 Capital coming is not going to give you
01:45:32.280 10 times fast result in fact it's going
01:45:34.260 to slow the process stuff that because
01:45:36.300 you don't need Capital to make the
01:45:37.679 changes that you need to make not
01:45:38.820 everything is about capital
01:45:40.320 so I think Capital afford you
01:45:42.960 larger
01:45:45.000 distribution in a manner where you can
01:45:47.040 reach more people no no I think like if
01:45:49.560 you're not talking about zero Capital
01:45:50.760 but I'm not talking about the capital
01:45:52.020 that everyone thinks that that Capital
01:45:53.520 if you throw at this is a this is an
01:45:56.520 overall Have You Ever Raised money at
01:45:58.080 upright yes we have raised money yeah
01:46:00.300 but I'm saying the cap capital for most
01:46:02.880 people sounds like if you're looking at
01:46:04.739 such a large sector and since you're
01:46:06.840 talking about your core group that will
01:46:08.280 want to listen to this one go there one
01:46:10.619 of the things I would say is you don't
01:46:12.239 need to have that kind of capital to
01:46:14.639 make the change in this sector and
01:46:16.380 that's going to be the fun part of it
01:46:17.580 because then it'll be longer lasting
01:46:19.500 it'll be a lot more permanent right and
01:46:22.739 I think the foundation will be even
01:46:24.060 stronger what about physics voila right
01:46:26.159 like what is he doing which is so
01:46:28.139 different I hear so much about physics
01:46:29.760 well have you heard of him so there is
01:46:31.980 this guy who is not spending
01:46:35.940 money
01:46:37.500 in the same amount and extend as other
01:46:40.380 attack players but is able to gather an
01:46:44.159 audience a paying audience based on his
01:46:47.460 popularity based on some say the quality
01:46:50.520 of his
01:46:51.659 teaching in physics or whatever like
01:46:54.000 the other way to look at that is he
01:46:55.739 built a business very frugally accepted
01:46:58.199 that you don't need money on it and it's
01:46:59.820 taken a fair bit of time to come to
01:47:01.440 where he has and I think that's where
01:47:03.119 the credit comes versus anything else
01:47:05.159 because so you like him then yeah I like
01:47:07.679 everybody who's an entrepreneur because
01:47:09.360 yeah so bloody difficult to do anything
01:47:11.520 in life so everyone needs incredible
01:47:14.040 amount of respect
01:47:15.600 and at the point in which you are
01:47:17.280 obviously as you rightly said there'll
01:47:18.780 be ups and downs but my question here is
01:47:21.239 what he did write is not put Capital
01:47:24.199 epicenter took a long-term View and the
01:47:27.719 result you're seeing right now so if you
01:47:29.639 go back for the last eight years and
01:47:31.080 analyze that and you see that report
01:47:32.699 card and you see somebody else's report
01:47:34.920 card of a chess thumping moment or
01:47:37.080 raising a billion dollars
01:47:39.139 this thematically is true across you
01:47:42.480 know
01:47:43.500 mature companies newer companies
01:47:46.380 folks they don't talk as much sometimes
01:47:49.080 can quietly build something and when
01:47:51.060 they come out it feels like it just
01:47:52.920 happened it just happened and another
01:47:54.420 part took link to something we said much
01:47:56.460 earlier not fundraising immediately puts
01:48:00.239 you outside of that uh you know media
01:48:03.320 Spotlight and this Spotlight of oh wow I
01:48:08.040 Am a Unicorn because I fundraised at a
01:48:10.080 certain valuation and you know now I'm
01:48:12.239 emotionally at that value you know
01:48:13.860 valuation there's a lot of companies in
01:48:16.320 India and around the world that are
01:48:18.420 quiet
01:48:19.800 and just to put this in the sector that
01:48:22.139 Jay is in I mean you've seen that I mean
01:48:24.780 you don't need to go into the startup
01:48:26.100 world to do that you've seen banks have
01:48:28.199 a different situation and how levels of
01:48:30.719 corruption excess transparency have come
01:48:33.480 in there just based on being funding so
01:48:36.000 it's not an ecosystem here it's mature
01:48:38.820 ecosystems like banking where you can
01:48:40.500 have that highly regulated systems just
01:48:43.080 remembered something since you're here
01:48:44.340 what do you think of the new TCS on lrs
01:48:49.260 I think it's complicated because at one
01:48:52.619 level
01:48:54.540 if we want the rupee to be competitor to
01:48:58.260 the dollar to the Yuan we want to be
01:49:02.760 free float as much as possible and you
01:49:05.100 want to be Capital again you want to be
01:49:06.960 completely convertible but
01:49:09.000 it's very easy to say that can I ask you
01:49:11.760 to prophesize if India were to become
01:49:14.880 truly convertible Capital account
01:49:16.800 convertible
01:49:18.119 let's say lrs the money going out of the
01:49:20.639 country is maybe 22 billion dollars
01:49:22.920 let's make our assumption it's somewhere
01:49:24.239 around that this year yeah
01:49:26.460 do you think more money would go out or
01:49:28.500 more money would come in I ask you this
01:49:30.719 while I preface that every International
01:49:34.380 Bank and investor I meet today wants to
01:49:37.320 come to India money would come in money
01:49:39.719 is coming in India is doing better I
01:49:41.520 actually agree with you and to on on the
01:49:44.580 uh lrs TCS point there is the real fact
01:49:48.540 that this was a loophole the fact that
01:49:51.239 that's what I'm saying in that context
01:49:52.679 we look at it in that loophole element
01:49:54.420 is the question is the question did they
01:49:57.480 plug the loophole or did they make it
01:49:59.460 significantly harder for people I think
01:50:02.340 they did it in three doses which then
01:50:04.020 got into an element of miscommunication
01:50:05.880 if you ask me but beyond the third dose
01:50:08.100 you still have to 20 TCS when you spend
01:50:11.400 your lrs but you can you can claim it
01:50:13.440 back yes it's I would say that is it the
01:50:16.619 most elegant solution yeah one could
01:50:18.420 argue not is the owners going to be on
01:50:20.340 you guys as a banker my understanding is
01:50:22.920 that Banks anybody if somebody spends on
01:50:25.980 On A bank's credit card the bank is
01:50:27.659 accountable to implement regulation and
01:50:29.760 that's part of being a regulated entity
01:50:31.199 and that's in significantly
01:50:35.480 no that's the case at all there is lots
01:50:39.480 of Regulation we also uh
01:50:42.420 the word Bank comes with a lot of trust
01:50:45.860 and that trust file is a good thing in
01:50:49.800 terms of attracting customers attracting
01:50:51.480 deposit comes with responsibility great
01:50:54.659 power comes great responsibility that is
01:50:56.880 The Regulators can make a change that
01:50:58.920 they see fit for for policy and I think
01:51:01.080 sometimes you get irritated because of
01:51:02.580 the communication level and when you do
01:51:04.020 it in three Doses and then everyone
01:51:06.060 thinks now this is just enough like why
01:51:07.980 do you want to get there but at the end
01:51:09.179 of the day the report card is quite
01:51:10.560 clear yeah if if you are spending 250
01:51:13.980 000 a year which means you should be a
01:51:16.199 high tax paying back or a sufficient
01:51:18.239 good tax paying bracket yeah in which
01:51:20.040 case you'll be cash neutral at the end
01:51:21.540 of the year yeah my point here is I
01:51:24.179 actually truly believe right this is not
01:51:27.000 for the sake of euphemizing some other
01:51:29.340 thought of mine but
01:51:31.320 every International investor I talked to
01:51:33.840 today
01:51:34.800 is really critical especially in America
01:51:37.020 in the West in Europe
01:51:38.699 they're they're really critical about
01:51:40.860 their own economy but I would say 80 90
01:51:43.920 percent are sanguine about the prospect
01:51:46.020 of India and wanting wanting some form
01:51:48.420 of participation
01:51:50.060 we're not one of the highest
01:51:52.460 taxation but if we open up I truly
01:51:54.960 believe more money will come in but I
01:51:57.119 don't think this has got to do with open
01:51:58.440 up it's not about it's sure sorry carry
01:52:00.900 on I'll go after no because I think this
01:52:02.699 if there was a reverse GST on it and for
01:52:05.639 every 250 you are gone with you know
01:52:08.520 this is not that it is just about saying
01:52:10.619 we don't know whether you've necessarily
01:52:12.000 paid your tax and therefore take it at
01:52:14.100 the end of the year if you open up
01:52:15.659 completely you also become Mercy even
01:52:19.560 more to something the FED may do that is
01:52:22.619 really silly that causes violent Capital
01:52:24.900 flight that was nothing to do with you
01:52:26.400 and we've seen over the past 30 40 years
01:52:28.860 financially right foreign Capital flight
01:52:30.960 because of nothing but that can happen
01:52:34.199 with the Norms because they are not
01:52:35.639 subject but less has come in
01:52:40.880 is coming and how if you open a
01:52:44.460 Floodgate very quickly and this would be
01:52:46.260 an I would say how policy makers would
01:52:48.659 argue it are you bringing in stable
01:52:51.300 long-term capital that's looking at
01:52:54.179 investing in the country or are you
01:52:56.699 bringing in short-term you know quick
01:52:59.760 profit seeking Capital so
01:53:01.980 I think we've ridden the storm quite
01:53:04.619 well through three of these ones because
01:53:06.480 I think we've been a little bit more
01:53:08.340 prudent right do you think this funnel
01:53:10.679 of money which came into India attack
01:53:14.639 many other sectors in the last decade
01:53:17.580 when say the cost of borrowing in the
01:53:19.739 West Was a fraction of what it was what
01:53:22.440 it is now maybe it was one percent now
01:53:24.239 it's maybe five and a half percent
01:53:26.580 how long do you think this winter will
01:53:28.320 continue for and when you look at large
01:53:31.440 numbers of companies like SoftBank and
01:53:35.060 temasek and all these big guys tiger
01:53:37.679 Global they all seem to be down so much
01:53:40.980 what you think will incentivize the
01:53:44.820 fresh
01:53:45.900 risk
01:53:47.460 chasing money to come into India and in
01:53:50.400 turn into a tech I think a lot of that
01:53:52.199 money came in actually came in from the
01:53:53.820 East Coast but went to the West Coast
01:53:55.139 guys because most of the money got spent
01:53:57.000 on advertising and spending out of the
01:53:59.340 West Coast guys in America so actually
01:54:01.080 some sense of in and out happened there
01:54:03.780 I wouldn't put temasek and SoftBank and
01:54:05.820 tiger all in the same bracket one is a
01:54:07.380 sovereign fund one has a lot more the
01:54:09.480 same individually run one has got a
01:54:11.520 great track record no stand sense of
01:54:13.380 judgment on it actually not domestic I'm
01:54:15.119 talking about tiger yeah tiger SoftBank
01:54:17.100 whatever else see I think it's a little
01:54:19.320 bit like if I'm if I gave you this
01:54:21.119 example if I want to do eight risk
01:54:22.920 because the two that I want to win I win
01:54:24.719 at 40x
01:54:26.219 that's a point of view and if you want
01:54:28.260 to play that you will have good years
01:54:29.580 and you'll have bad years you may have
01:54:30.900 good five years and 10 bad years but
01:54:34.020 in eventually if you're looking at that
01:54:36.920 20x30x40x they may want to do exactly
01:54:39.119 what they want to do and today
01:54:42.420 a lot of these people are burnt in the
01:54:44.340 public markets not in the private
01:54:45.719 markets but the question of yours was a
01:54:47.639 lot more in the private Market than the
01:54:49.139 public market so we have to keep that in
01:54:51.600 mind also there's nothing listed really
01:54:53.100 right in India in their Tech sector no
01:54:54.960 no but the the mindset of these and the
01:54:58.619 winter is set in because in the public
01:55:00.719 markets they've lost more money much
01:55:02.580 less than they've lost in the private
01:55:03.960 market and that has created this
01:55:06.480 perceived program not just about edtech
01:55:08.699 this is about yeah I think what will
01:55:11.159 also happen is that
01:55:13.380 um even even when the winter is over
01:55:16.560 the the disciplined ways the disciplined
01:55:19.679 ways of building companies will come
01:55:21.719 back and people will start building
01:55:24.260 higher valued companies with much less
01:55:27.060 Capital well why do we classify winter
01:55:29.820 with the inflow versus the winter will
01:55:33.060 be if
01:55:34.260 the market is closed down the prospects
01:55:36.960 of consumer spending is slowed down
01:55:38.520 there would be a snowstorm sorry that
01:55:40.500 would be like
01:55:42.900 but but the thing is for a lot of young
01:55:45.060 people I don't know why at the Starting
01:55:46.560 Gate everyone's calling in the winter
01:55:48.060 just because
01:55:49.340 no no but
01:55:51.179 the situation in Bangalore is quite bad
01:55:53.460 in the startup ecosystem no no but what
01:55:55.560 you guys are not understanding maybe in
01:55:57.060 this skyscraper yeah no no no no no it
01:56:00.420 is but it also compared to 2019
01:56:05.580 India is bad it's just compared to 21.
01:56:08.719 no see a lot of people who want to start
01:56:11.520 up the first check that they get is will
01:56:15.300 be from like an angel fund or an
01:56:16.860 Institutional fund or not
01:56:18.960 the nine out of ten people that we're
01:56:20.880 talking about don't get a check to start
01:56:23.340 but that doesn't mean they don't start
01:56:25.800 and I think we should be just a little
01:56:27.540 bit realistic about that thought process
01:56:29.219 so you are saying that it is possible to
01:56:31.500 build a fairly large tech company
01:56:33.719 without raising capital I think in media
01:56:36.300 one did it for eight years without
01:56:38.400 raising one rupee
01:56:45.139 yeah exactly but ninety percent of the
01:56:48.300 large tech companies and especially I'm
01:56:50.219 talking about tech where you have to
01:56:52.500 have some sort of an advantage to scale
01:56:54.780 fast to speed first I think Venture
01:56:56.820 Capital plays a huge role what is fast
01:56:59.520 it's a subjective definition created by
01:57:02.760 philosophy velocity set by some other
01:57:05.040 people but ours is not fast I've been
01:57:06.659 doing the same job I do today for 19
01:57:08.639 years full-time trading investing and
01:57:11.639 people are losing the thing that it
01:57:13.139 takes it takes time it takes time it
01:57:15.179 takes time you lose the value of it
01:57:16.800 takes time you're in trouble like exact
01:57:19.440 same job same schedule same routine
01:57:21.420 everything same for 19 years even big
01:57:24.659 Tech took time and you know one of the
01:57:26.159 things I look at big Tech I look at
01:57:27.540 Google or Facebook the founders still
01:57:29.340 own large shares yeah because they
01:57:31.500 didn't dilute the way current Founders
01:57:33.480 are diluting it's crazy
01:57:35.599 you know where at Series E or at nine
01:57:38.820 percent
01:57:39.780 okay guys again mindful of eight minutes
01:57:42.239 or whatever we have left
01:57:44.580 maybe take the last couple of minutes
01:57:46.980 each
01:57:48.780 to say
01:57:50.219 what have you learned
01:57:53.460 that you wish you knew before starting
01:57:55.440 upgrad before starting an academy before
01:57:57.840 everything Jay has done in the realm of
01:58:00.780 Education something for people starting
01:58:02.699 off today to watch out for and if you
01:58:05.400 had two choices to change about
01:58:07.320 education overall what would they be
01:58:11.340 so
01:58:12.659 I think
01:58:14.460 I've said this before and I'll say it
01:58:16.320 again we don't have the liberty for
01:58:18.360 hindsight and I think anyone starting up
01:58:20.520 needs to understand that that if the
01:58:22.139 formula is one about hindsight it
01:58:23.760 doesn't happen that way if in 1995 I did
01:58:27.060 this this and this I would have been a
01:58:28.619 10x value of my media company doesn't I
01:58:30.719 could have been bankrupt because five
01:58:32.400 other things would have happened there
01:58:34.320 so to me it is a learning process it's
01:58:37.139 an iterative process and if you look at
01:58:38.880 it always fast forward and forward
01:58:40.820 versus hindsight you're going to be able
01:58:44.219 to actually better your odds of success
01:58:47.099 so for anyone who's looking for what
01:58:49.800 would I do in the rear view mirror the
01:58:52.199 the possibility is that you'll do a lot
01:58:54.420 more wrong if you keep looking in the
01:58:55.800 rear view mirror because one thing I
01:58:57.659 gather from you a lot is you take a
01:59:01.080 certain amount of pride in the wrong
01:59:03.179 that you have done and you speak about
01:59:04.679 it yeah I think so in a way what you're
01:59:08.400 also saying is not having an ego about
01:59:11.280 the mistakes you have made is very
01:59:12.780 important but we don't talk about it
01:59:14.940 that often and we should talk about it
01:59:16.679 I'm not saying we need to bang the table
01:59:18.239 about it but we do need to talk about it
01:59:19.860 and I think part of what we have thawing
01:59:22.080 the icebergs here of the not the next
01:59:25.199 thousand entrepreneurs but the next
01:59:26.639 million entrepreneurs are going to come
01:59:27.780 if you thought the iceberg not throw in
01:59:30.420 a couple of ice cubes nice nice and two
01:59:33.480 things you would like to change about
01:59:34.679 education overall
01:59:36.900 two specific things what needs to change
01:59:39.119 what will likely change okay give me one
01:59:40.860 that needs to I think there is one level
01:59:42.659 of structure in the formal education
01:59:45.239 space which we need to respect because
01:59:47.699 if we go disrupting that it's not going
01:59:50.040 to be there we need to layer it we need
01:59:52.080 to augment it we need to have a much
01:59:53.940 more rounded element to that thought
01:59:55.860 process that will make a world of a
01:59:58.500 difference because it'll get people at a
02:00:00.659 much younger age to be a lot more aware
02:00:03.060 and second I think in education whether
02:00:04.560 we like it or not there is the Haves and
02:00:06.179 The Haves and not and I emotionally and
02:00:10.320 passionately believe that if we fix the
02:00:12.239 have-nots a little bit more disc
02:00:13.920 proportionately will all be in a
02:00:16.739 different Marketplace so for me at this
02:00:18.960 stage in my life Market making and
02:00:20.699 opening up at scale is quite an
02:00:22.739 obsession
02:00:23.760 so I think those are two macro points
02:00:25.800 for me
02:00:27.000 so for me
02:00:28.679 two themes one is theme at a system
02:00:31.260 level and one is at an individual level
02:00:33.540 at a system level I think I agree with
02:00:36.300 Ronnie don't break parts of what is
02:00:38.639 traditional
02:00:41.580 simply
02:00:45.199 widen the number of people that can
02:00:48.239 access what is traditional for me a far
02:00:51.179 bigger problem is
02:00:52.800 not necessarily the quality of the
02:00:54.780 education I'm coming from outside their
02:00:56.219 Tech sector so it's easier for me to say
02:00:58.020 that because I'm uh
02:01:01.020 not you know biased towards necessarily
02:01:04.560 thinking the opposite way maybe I'm
02:01:06.360 wrong
02:01:07.260 and widen just giving everybody more
02:01:10.320 making it meritocratic and then allowing
02:01:12.179 Merit to take cause the challenge right
02:01:15.119 now is that most people struggle to get
02:01:16.860 access to Basics that make even access
02:01:20.699 to education and then the brand name
02:01:22.500 kind of spiral so that for me is the
02:01:24.659 individual side uh at the system side at
02:01:27.840 an individual side it's much more again
02:01:29.940 the theme we've touched on learning from
02:01:31.920 people not learning from courses and
02:01:34.320 learning from books I think learning
02:01:37.080 from people is
02:01:38.460 it's
02:01:39.800 harder to surround yourself but at some
02:01:42.360 level we make decisions of who we
02:01:44.820 surround ourselves with and those are
02:01:48.000 semi-conscious at least I know some
02:01:49.679 people have less of a choice in them
02:01:51.719 and I think that that to me is lifelong
02:01:54.239 learning
02:01:55.500 after the age of at the latest 30 but
02:01:58.679 for most people 23 or 24 is learning
02:02:00.599 from people yeah
02:02:02.820 can you repeat the question
02:02:04.860 one thing you've learned in your journey
02:02:06.900 in the journey around education
02:02:10.500 that you would like to share so the new
02:02:12.780 budding entrepreneurs can keep that in
02:02:14.880 mind second part of the question if you
02:02:18.000 could change arbitrarily one one very
02:02:21.599 fundamental first principles
02:02:24.780 kind of thing about education what would
02:02:26.699 you change so I'll start with the second
02:02:28.380 one first what I would like to change is
02:02:30.719 that even today
02:02:33.060 I think
02:02:35.159 everybody there is a lot more focus on
02:02:37.920 content and education Etc
02:02:40.520 I like to believe that technologists are
02:02:43.080 not coming in the sector I like to
02:02:45.000 believe that the way a Duolingo has
02:02:47.760 solved a problem where it's a completely
02:02:50.360 computer generated program or a game
02:02:53.119 teaching people and obviously there is
02:02:56.159 humor intervention that has gone into it
02:02:58.880 or there is Roblox where
02:03:01.760 every third kid is using in U.S like or
02:03:05.760 playing a game on Roblox
02:03:07.440 I think people are not building enough
02:03:09.000 technology stuff so one thing I would
02:03:10.679 like to change is that I would request
02:03:12.599 entrepreneurs that education is a big
02:03:14.880 sector uh don't just be stuck in fintech
02:03:18.380 uh look Beyond fintech every other
02:03:21.239 founder I meet is I'm doing fintech this
02:03:23.820 I'm doing fintech that yes fintech is a
02:03:25.980 big Market fintech is fun yeah yes yes
02:03:28.800 fintech is a big Market but there are
02:03:31.739 other sectors also where a large part of
02:03:34.920 large companies will be created
02:03:39.020 and second thing which I have a huge
02:03:42.119 problem with is that uh
02:03:44.099 and this is nothing to do with that Tech
02:03:46.320 this is more uh I think the ambition of
02:03:50.040 Founders in India is very low
02:03:52.020 I think uh I see some co-founders
02:03:55.260 exiting after taking some minor
02:03:57.480 secondary I see uh people getting
02:03:59.880 satisfied very less but let's say if you
02:04:02.820 if you if you look at a dependent office
02:04:05.219 Nola
02:04:07.380 and the kind of aspirations they have
02:04:09.960 for their act two
02:04:12.840 amazing aspirations so what what we also
02:04:15.139 like we want super duper ambitious
02:04:18.239 people and Technology people to uh also
02:04:21.540 come to Ed Tech and uh be ambitious in
02:04:24.540 general so um and and more than
02:04:26.699 education see I believe that yes
02:04:28.260 peer-to-peer learning and people
02:04:29.639 learning from people is good uh but my
02:04:33.000 view is which is completely different I
02:04:35.580 I don't think that's practical I don't
02:04:37.199 think that's what will scale
02:04:38.900 Duolingo now has 60 million Maus
02:04:43.080 there is no other person on the app
02:04:46.219 there are 8 million paid users this is
02:04:49.679 from their last earnings report stock is
02:04:51.719 trading at 15x Revenue six billion
02:04:54.000 dollar company
02:04:55.080 no human is involved no social
02:04:57.420 experience there is gamification and a
02:05:00.060 computer teaching you
02:05:01.619 and I think lifelong learning though
02:05:04.320 theoretically sounds good I don't think
02:05:06.840 anybody wants to you have to solve for
02:05:08.940 motivation in an ideal scenario I yes
02:05:12.119 people should do lifelong learning
02:05:14.639 but they don't so how do we solve for
02:05:16.860 motivation that you know you study
02:05:19.860 psychology
02:05:21.119 for Learning and not because you want to
02:05:23.400 correct this examination so I think
02:05:24.599 these are the few uh thoughts that I
02:05:27.659 have but and one last prediction I would
02:05:30.060 like to make is that we don't realize
02:05:31.800 that how much AI will change education I
02:05:35.340 think every most of the stuff that we
02:05:37.080 discussed today would look irrelevant
02:05:39.179 one year from now and we don't realize
02:05:41.280 that five years from now every household
02:05:43.500 will have a robot like personal
02:05:45.900 computers changed everything if you look
02:05:48.420 at the latest product that ring has
02:05:50.639 introduced the doorbell cam now ring has
02:05:54.000 a drone which can value our away access
02:05:56.520 your entire home and what Tesla bot is
02:05:59.280 doing I think we are maybe three or four
02:06:01.440 or five years away where every household
02:06:03.420 in the world especially starting with
02:06:05.280 the uh people who can afford it will
02:06:08.760 have a robot so I think that will also
02:06:10.500 change a lot of things super
02:06:13.080 my thing I can paint a optimistic
02:06:16.440 picture or a very dystopian one I'm
02:06:18.780 gonna pick the latter
02:06:20.639 uh I feel like the modern construct of a
02:06:24.719 family
02:06:26.040 husband wife child or non-child or
02:06:30.119 non-child
02:06:31.320 is not
02:06:33.840 is not the best to Fester education in
02:06:38.340 the manner that I would dream for it to
02:06:40.500 be
02:06:41.340 I think if you go back in time before
02:06:44.040 organized religion and many other things
02:06:46.860 each kid learned from the community
02:06:50.580 and he fixated upon
02:06:53.040 what skill set he might like in the
02:06:55.679 community what he would like to
02:06:57.119 inculcate I feel the modern
02:07:00.239 notion of a family we tell our kids what
02:07:02.880 religion to follow we tell our kids what
02:07:04.739 it is okay to study maybe not
02:07:06.960 consciously but subconsciously
02:07:09.239 uh
02:07:10.739 I don't know how this will work but
02:07:13.020 going back to a world
02:07:15.179 where
02:07:17.040 the mimetic influences of the world are
02:07:20.280 lesser on the child and the child
02:07:23.820 is allowed an environment to be more
02:07:26.219 organic about the learning choices he
02:07:28.380 makes is something that should change
02:07:30.119 about education
02:07:32.400 make sense yeah well put yeah
02:07:35.280 yeah done so thank you everyone and
