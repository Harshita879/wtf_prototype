00:01:30.960 the beginning you're a bar owner so

00:01:38.920 same trust me we need some alcohol and
00:01:41.560 then we'll start no so yeah so I I
00:01:44.600 started um my journey into this industry
00:01:49.640 uh right from hotel management days so I
00:01:53.119 did my hotel management from iimp Pusa
00:01:54.840 New Delhi um and from there on uh uh in
00:01:59.119 the second year of College just like
00:02:01.039 most of us we needed pocket money for
00:02:03.600 the pizza and beers and so we where did
00:02:06.640 you do college IHM Pusa New Delhi so uh
00:02:09.919 and finished my schooling in college
00:02:12.000 from Delhi and since then I've been in
00:02:14.200 Delhi okay so you went to college then
00:02:17.120 uh yeah so uh I started bartending in
00:02:19.160 the second year of college as a as a
00:02:21.440 almost like a you there's something
00:02:23.280 called odc's which are outdo do you have
00:02:25.480 pictures from back there yeah yeah yeah
00:02:28.120 now we should put that up okay
00:02:31.280 then okay so that was my first
00:02:33.720 experience behind the bar um I I also
00:02:36.400 think that was also a very big turning
00:02:37.959 point for me I was really lucky to have
00:02:40.599 experienced really good uh you know
00:02:44.200 space of work for the first time when
00:02:45.920 you go um it was it was not a it was
00:02:48.560 just a part-time job uh and you know you
00:02:50.720 were just doing it for fun mostly for
00:02:52.159 money and uh when I went behind the bar
00:02:54.760 I started really enjoying it and I I
00:02:56.720 felt like I don't know if there's a word
00:02:59.360 for this I I really felt like this is my
00:03:00.920 calling and I got what element of
00:03:03.040 bartending actual bartending so I loved
00:03:05.480 making drinks I loved serving drinks I
00:03:07.959 love the part of hosting and talking to
00:03:09.680 new people getting was the social
00:03:11.799 element more or was it the mixing
00:03:13.799 absolutely absolutely so bartending is a
00:03:15.480 mix of many things of course the
00:03:17.360 technical art of it of making drinks is
00:03:19.480 is is primary but after that it's layer
00:03:22.000 on layer on your personality and how
00:03:23.959 sociable you are and how open you are to
00:03:25.920 knowing new people talking to strangers
00:03:28.200 and how you know what your personality
00:03:30.120 is and I think bartending can bring that
00:03:32.760 personality out in you it's very it's a
00:03:34.599 very good comfortable space because you
00:03:36.200 are also already in a space of enjoyment
00:03:38.599 you're mostly there to relax so you also
00:03:40.879 come with your guards down a little bit
00:03:42.480 so I think from a consumer point of view
00:03:43.959 it works really well and I had a great
00:03:46.959 uh time in that second and third year of
00:03:48.840 college bartenders tend to be
00:03:51.680 particularly
00:03:53.920 good-look um no I don't think so I I
00:03:57.000 don't that I think that's not a good
00:03:59.159 looking and good grooming are two
00:04:01.040 different things and I would say that
00:04:02.840 that's because when you're in a hotel
00:04:04.480 background or hotel industry you're
00:04:05.920 expected to be turned out well your hair
00:04:07.599 is in place your nails are in place
00:04:09.640 that's part of grooming and I feel
00:04:10.760 that's also part of hygiene and because
00:04:12.519 you're serving food you're serving
00:04:13.680 drinks I don't want a Shabby looking
00:04:15.239 person you know preparing my food for
00:04:17.279 example it's the same way I don't want a
00:04:18.839 Shabby looking person making drinks for
00:04:20.358 me so I think grooming is where the
00:04:22.320 center point is and after that of course
00:04:24.400 you can be groomed well you can wear a
00:04:26.199 beautiful designer shirt and look really
00:04:27.800 good okay so Bart ending second year of
00:04:30.520 college then and um after that uh when I
00:04:34.280 was in third year U as expected most of
00:04:37.520 the hotel management students back then
00:04:39.160 it's I'm also referring to now 20 years
00:04:41.199 ago back then um it was expected that
00:04:43.960 now you'll become a hotel manager you'll
00:04:46.000 become you'll get into Management
00:04:47.560 training program and then then you get a
00:04:50.080 suit and you're sorted right so it's
00:04:51.960 it's the blue colar white colar part of
00:04:54.039 it and my parents weren't very happy
00:04:56.120 when I told them that I don't want to do
00:04:57.520 hotel I don't want to be a manager in a
00:04:59.440 hotel
00:05:00.240 I'd rather be bartending and that was a
00:05:02.880 difficult phase for us as a family as
00:05:05.120 well but somewhere I took the decision
00:05:08.080 to continue Bart ending I did a Bart
00:05:09.600 ending course and I think that is when I
00:05:12.160 realized the real yeah in India uh my
00:05:15.039 business partner current business
00:05:16.440 partner Yang du blama had just started
00:05:18.319 his bartending school so we I was
00:05:20.280 actually one of the first initial
00:05:21.520 batches of kids who came out this was
00:05:23.960 that that uh back then was this is 20034
00:05:27.840 and it four or five actually and this
00:05:30.199 time uh funnily it was a 6-month course
00:05:33.319 and you were supposed to after doing
00:05:34.639 your classes also bartend so it was
00:05:36.720 literally like 14h hour days 16h hour
00:05:39.880 days and for some odd reason I I still
00:05:43.120 enjoyed it a lot and I kept doing it I
00:05:45.280 was at it uh and I think where the
00:05:47.919 biggest U turning point I mean there was
00:05:50.639 this whole moment where I was like okay
00:05:52.400 I'm going to be a bartender I'm going to
00:05:53.720 work in this this place and that place I
00:05:55.840 was dreaming all these big dreams and
00:05:58.199 then I realized that women are not
00:05:59.680 allowed to bartend in IND India uh it's
00:06:02.240 actually illegal today to certain states
00:06:05.199 in India uh women are not legally
00:06:07.599 allowed to serve also like even
00:06:10.039 waitressing wise or be actually making
00:06:12.840 drinks so that was quite a stop for me
00:06:16.039 um I didn't have the option to actually
00:06:17.720 move outside of India I was barely
00:06:19.360 managing it in Delhi um that's when I
00:06:22.120 kind of looked around and what to do and
00:06:24.759 that time Yang do actually introduced me
00:06:26.360 to somebody who had just started off uh
00:06:28.599 this website called lio.com it used to
00:06:31.199 be working for bage marketing companies
00:06:33.479 trainings a lot of spa the space was the
00:06:35.759 same uh just not B ending and actually
00:06:39.160 was their first employee and I started
00:06:41.240 with data entry and a lot of that but I
00:06:43.599 actually still really wanted to be there
00:06:45.199 so I continue doing it with uh little
00:06:48.039 money and yeah so those those years were
00:06:50.599 a struggle but I also think that I
00:06:53.080 actually look back very very fondly at
00:06:54.759 that time because those were my I feel I
00:06:57.199 was very lucky to find the space to
00:06:59.240 still continue in the industry without
00:07:01.680 actually have the option to do uh while
00:07:04.199 working in tell I got to travel a lot I
00:07:06.280 travel all over India they were doing
00:07:08.000 projects with bakadi with smof uh I was
00:07:10.520 working extensively with these Brands
00:07:12.360 these were the brands that were actually
00:07:13.599 entering in these are Global Brands uh
00:07:16.520 Multinational Global Brands and they
00:07:18.360 were actually entering India for the
00:07:20.120 first time and so they needed bartender
00:07:22.039 training programs customer activation a
00:07:24.800 lot of a lot of lot of below the line
00:07:27.039 Activation so I was part of all these
00:07:29.000 multiple project so I would actually
00:07:30.720 take a flight every weekend to a
00:07:33.319 different city so it was a Delhi Bombay
00:07:34.720 Bangalore Hyderabad Kata Punjab Jaipur
00:07:37.080 rur multiple cities uh I think that was
00:07:40.919 like a intense crazy two years of my
00:07:43.360 time and I loved every bit of it uh
00:07:46.599 learned a lot interacted a lot with a
00:07:48.680 lot of people I learned about what the
00:07:51.360 corporate means how businesses work how
00:07:54.400 all the other things work right what how
00:07:56.159 does how is the spirit made I took
00:07:58.280 courses to actually learn how a Jin is
00:08:00.199 made or how a watka is made things like
00:08:02.039 that um and continue to actually grow in
00:08:05.280 the in that space and and and then I got
00:08:08.120 my break in a company called diio which
00:08:10.120 was actually it is still actually
00:08:12.599 globally number one in the world and uh
00:08:15.319 I started working with a brand called
00:08:16.800 Captain Morgan uh very short stint that
00:08:19.520 time it was a rum that launched and uh
00:08:21.919 so they launched in Bombay so their
00:08:23.840 office was here and then U head office
00:08:26.120 was in Bombay and then in uh Delhi they
00:08:28.960 launched so we kind of handled Captain
00:08:31.039 Morgan and then I moved to peror Rica
00:08:33.240 which is another liquor giant there I
00:08:35.320 stayed for about three and a half years
00:08:37.240 but during this whole time in 2 I can I
00:08:40.320 have to tell you in
00:08:41.880 2006 I made my first Excel sheet of
00:08:44.839 having my own bar you know and I still
00:08:47.080 have that Excel sheet of all the cost in
00:08:49.920 the world and at that time I called amid
00:08:52.000 bman you know the founder of darber and
00:08:55.680 at that time used to run a bar in uh in
00:08:57.920 Delhi called forum and I took one hour
00:09:00.279 of his time asking him how much does the
00:09:02.079 class cost how much does the kitchen
00:09:03.800 cost how much is how much do you pay a
00:09:05.800 manager I had no idea how to build this
00:09:08.279 sheet right so I built it and very
00:09:10.320 nicely actually gave all the details
00:09:12.399 heard me out and uh and then yeah the
00:09:15.760 dream was alive and yang dup and I kept
00:09:18.200 talking we were he was a trainer very
00:09:20.800 well established you know bartender
00:09:22.959 mixologist uh he's an author he's many
00:09:25.399 many things and uh so we kept talking
00:09:28.040 about doing something together
00:09:30.160 starting our own bar and at that time I
00:09:31.920 think the dream was to have a bar for
00:09:33.959 people like us that was always the
00:09:35.760 conversation we were like where are the
00:09:37.160 bars where you go quietly sit chat have
00:09:39.760 a good drink why are all the bars so
00:09:42.120 loud why do they expect us to dance
00:09:43.920 right now or you know dress up all the
00:09:46.600 time you know where are the bars which
00:09:48.040 when you go to London you go to New York
00:09:49.519 you go to I mean West was our mostly
00:09:51.800 that's our directional you know uh that
00:09:54.480 that's how you get inspiration globally
00:09:56.519 in the space of spirits and bars um
00:10:00.040 and we used to always talk about it
00:10:01.680 between us that where are the cool bars
00:10:03.560 man like where are the there are pubs
00:10:05.720 there are beer places there were like of
00:10:07.600 course we've always had institutions
00:10:09.480 which are which are amazing even at that
00:10:11.480 time but good cocktail bars with cool
00:10:14.279 bartenders talking to you and serving
00:10:17.120 you and owners being being there for you
00:10:20.200 does not happen here there are all you
00:10:22.720 know owners who are who walk into you
00:10:26.200 know the sap table and Friends and the
00:10:29.920 managers are like it's it's a very
00:10:31.480 different culture right in India when it
00:10:33.360 comes to bars and so uh yeah so we kind
00:10:37.040 of went through it and we went through
00:10:39.880 looking for investors we had our
00:10:41.560 conversations and finally we realized
00:10:43.079 that nobody's going to give us money to
00:10:44.800 start our bar and we really wanted to be
00:10:47.040 in South Delhi that was our Dream but
00:10:49.120 you know that what they say that God
00:10:50.440 gives you the opposite of what you want
00:10:52.560 and then we finally found a place in
00:10:54.800 guro in a basement in guro it's still
00:10:57.480 like kind of in the middle of nowhere is
00:10:59.560 how a lot of people refer to it people
00:11:01.399 who know this place it's called
00:11:02.920 cocktails and dreams PE easy that's our
00:11:04.560 first bar uh we started it in the
00:11:06.519 basement uh young dup was the bartender
00:11:08.320 I was the waiter that's how we like to
00:11:09.920 put it and we had two more people to
00:11:11.560 help us and we had about four people in
00:11:12.920 the kitchen do you have live music in
00:11:14.680 this SP yes I think I've been here
00:11:17.519 amazing and you a regular customer who
00:11:19.360 was there at least four times in a yeah
00:11:21.279 like I told you suir was one of our
00:11:22.959 first first uh how often does he come uh
00:11:27.160 now you know he's married and he has a
00:11:28.720 kid so should be there four times a week
00:11:30.519 with four different is there a
00:11:31.600 correlation being between being single
00:11:33.760 and going out to a bar I think that time
00:11:36.320 I think it just happened naturally
00:11:37.959 because that was one of the cooler bars
00:11:39.519 uh I mean that was the only bar which
00:11:41.040 was close to home why did you go there
00:11:42.880 shush uh because um I wanted to drink
00:11:46.760 cocktails and every there were not too
00:11:49.399 many places in the city at that point in
00:11:51.000 time which would serve cocktails how
00:11:53.000 many people walk into a bar for the
00:11:56.200 taste of a cocktail and how many walk
00:11:58.519 into a bar for for the people in the bar
00:12:00.959 so majority of the people will come for
00:12:03.519 the entire experience it's never one
00:12:05.639 thing um yes cocktails are of course
00:12:08.839 cocktails and food both are very much
00:12:11.680 you know your Center that's your point
00:12:12.959 of sale you have to sell cocktails and
00:12:14.680 food otherwise you're not selling the
00:12:15.800 lights and the table and the chair right
00:12:17.720 so I have to make money from that so I
00:12:19.440 have to get that right but other than
00:12:21.480 that music lighting people servers all
00:12:26.240 of it even the comfort of your chair
00:12:28.279 like the number of times we have we have
00:12:30.160 made our own Furniture ourselves even
00:12:32.160 now today we are making our own bar and
00:12:33.920 we're still making the furniture
00:12:35.199 ourselves so it's like it's part of who
00:12:37.720 you are right it's the craft of it and
00:12:40.160 also you go to your bar and be like okay
00:12:42.560 talk to talk to the bartender and be
00:12:44.040 like okay I do not like this make me
00:12:46.320 something else which was which was
00:12:47.680 amazing and not too many bars would be
00:12:49.560 doing that back back in the day yeah y
00:12:51.360 dup was all about that he used to make
00:12:52.720 drinks as for people so he I still know
00:12:55.000 the drink that sucher used to have and
00:12:57.279 to date he used to have this popcorn
00:12:58.839 shop
00:12:59.800 crazy person after every amazing it's
00:13:04.040 amazingly it's a no-brainer okay so yeah
00:13:06.079 so bars so bars are a lot about comfort
00:13:08.839 and you know knowing people many many
00:13:11.519 things so if I I can't just put like my
00:13:13.920 finger to it but yes of course food
00:13:15.600 drinks music Ambience if you just to
00:13:17.600 make pillars there are four five big
00:13:19.440 pillars service these are like you have
00:13:21.800 to have them sorted and then everything
00:13:23.320 else hopefully aligns so you started uh
00:13:28.199 cocktail and dreams in 2012 yeah and
00:13:30.720 then how did side car happen side car is
00:13:33.320 Asia's world yeah we were part of
00:13:35.800 world's list we are part of Asia list we
00:13:37.720 part of we are number one in India for
00:13:40.279 the last consecutive three years number
00:13:42.959 one bar in India India which is so much
00:13:44.680 more stressful than the international
00:13:46.000 Awards I'm telling you really cuz it's
00:13:47.800 pure man you know what I mean right
00:13:49.440 Indians voting for Indians and being
00:13:52.560 number one actually not because every
00:13:54.160 time there's a competition in the
00:13:55.320 country I know the top three who are the
00:13:57.800 top it always be
00:14:00.160 stop it that's not but you know
00:14:02.759 it one by B I think will happen arit
00:14:06.480 bars you know yeah but
00:14:08.880 yeah forward is just yeah among the top
00:14:12.880 forward forward bar indust is very small
00:14:15.759 we all know each other from but how much
00:14:17.440 would be your Revenue because side car
00:14:19.440 is known for the best cocktails so
00:14:21.759 between cocktails and spirit what would
00:14:24.600 be the I'm I'm sitting in a very good
00:14:27.120 85% cocktails and the
00:14:30.040 fantastic so I think moving on so you
00:14:33.720 know when I heard about you first rias
00:14:35.680 called me one day and he's like you have
00:14:38.120 to invest in Goa Brewing Company I'm
00:14:39.959 connecting you to him that's so sweet of
00:14:42.240 ryaz what is the story of Goa Brewing
00:14:45.800 Company and why are so many
00:14:49.160 people vouching for you in a world
00:14:52.720 riddled with many different Indian
00:14:55.279 independent beer
00:14:57.480 brands I think vouch ing is all their
00:15:00.120 kindness I'm really grateful to who
00:15:02.279 everyone but I think from a story um we
00:15:06.480 I grew up in panim small town of Goa
00:15:08.959 parents were worked as government
00:15:11.160 employees mother father both went to
00:15:13.880 work so we were literally you know had
00:15:16.440 the whole town to ourselves it was very
00:15:18.160 navigatable as kids great life um you
00:15:22.759 know went to Hotel school because
00:15:25.480 couldn't get into any engineering
00:15:27.360 College I I could go to to some rural
00:15:30.720 College of Engineering but that didn't
00:15:32.680 seem exciting I took a year to school in
00:15:34.639 go yes I went to school everything in
00:15:37.199 Goa until uh I graduated your dad was
00:15:39.680 posted there no no my dad was working in
00:15:42.240 the he he joined as a land surveyor
00:15:44.880 parents were first generation moving
00:15:47.319 from Village to the city educated so
00:15:50.800 their entire Focus was to educate us as
00:15:53.319 kids a younger brother who also again
00:15:55.839 lives in California and um
00:16:00.079 while we were growing up I think U uh
00:16:03.240 there was varied experiences also you
00:16:05.199 know Goa is quite Charming that way in
00:16:07.519 terms of um it had its own micro culture
00:16:12.600 so you saw a lot of people Travelers
00:16:14.759 tourist you know people visiting and you
00:16:17.920 were also exposed to a completely
00:16:19.560 different life which was very different
00:16:21.839 from what you were living in your small
00:16:24.639 town and uh then I joined Hotel school I
00:16:28.759 went went to IHM Goa graduated but it
00:16:31.480 really didn't feel like working in the
00:16:33.120 hotels so I was just looking for a job
00:16:36.600 and uh king fisher the beer company was
00:16:39.720 hiring and I just went for an interview
00:16:41.600 I had no experience they just I don't
00:16:44.079 know offered me the job because I was
00:16:45.800 extremely like you know en2 what year
00:16:48.240 was this this was in the year
00:16:50.240 2006 so that was the first understanding
00:16:53.680 of how you know the liquor industry
00:16:55.800 works you know because beer operates
00:16:58.920 almost like fmcg and when you are
00:17:00.880 working for a for a large Beer Company
00:17:03.279 you are the operational length and
00:17:06.240 breadth of it is unlike any other
00:17:08.599 alcohol category I think beer has to
00:17:11.079 reach the last you wouldn't travel like
00:17:13.280 for a wine you may go a little further
00:17:15.000 but for beer you'll want it very close
00:17:17.280 to your home it's it's very different so
00:17:20.240 it operates very fast you order so if in
00:17:23.760 a liquor company order Cycles maybe once
00:17:25.799 in a month in beer you get like every 3
00:17:27.760 4 days so ation Al very very exciting
00:17:31.799 got got a sense of that then I got a job
00:17:34.640 to work with pero Rica which is this
00:17:36.880 French company great time to join them
00:17:39.720 because it was it was entirely actually
00:17:42.200 built by Indian Executives Paro and
00:17:46.400 these he in Goa now that was then were
00:17:49.919 you no I was in perno by then but perno
00:17:52.760 had acquired it's very interesting that
00:17:55.120 when uh the seams family which owned uh
00:17:58.559 which was the world's biggest liquor
00:18:00.400 company the the founder wanted to just
00:18:03.120 sell out and there was nobody who could
00:18:04.840 buy it so it was split between many
00:18:07.039 people and nobody wanted to take the
00:18:08.400 India business and perno got it and
00:18:11.240 perno turned it around and today I think
00:18:13.400 made it massively profitable yeah like
00:18:15.000 25,000 CR in Revenue it's I think the
00:18:18.280 most profitable liquor company but
00:18:20.120 entire so the DNA was very interesting
00:18:22.320 while I was working at perno you had
00:18:23.840 great Executives who were very
00:18:26.120 supportive of talent so got to work
00:18:29.280 within perno so from Goa to chandigar
00:18:32.720 which was again like a complete 360°
00:18:35.080 shock for me and I looked after
00:18:37.039 marketing for Northwest India so got a
00:18:39.679 very different sense of how India is
00:18:42.400 then moved to the brand Team uh where I
00:18:44.640 was given one of the biggest brands to
00:18:46.400 manage for a short time I was looking
00:18:48.679 after Royal stag which is I think I
00:18:50.919 don't know if it's still the biggest but
00:18:52.320 it was quite big so when did that
00:18:53.880 campaign come no artificial flavors was
00:18:55.880 it by you no no this was before me yeah
00:18:58.159 no artific yeah that really that really
00:19:01.000 this whole green whiskey story when I
00:19:03.039 was there Royal stag became the number
00:19:04.520 one in the world it was number one
00:19:05.919 highest yeah
00:19:07.720 biggest it's still number one right yeah
00:19:10.440 I mean it I I don't know today like also
00:19:12.840 that category is very it's it's it's
00:19:15.559 number one is is it in revenue or in
00:19:17.159 volume not Revenue yeah volume volum
00:19:19.039 volum but there's a royal Challenge and
00:19:21.159 these guys are sort of neck and neck
00:19:23.039 most no no Royal challenges come down so
00:19:25.159 now Royal stag is there yeah they say UB
00:19:27.520 has 25% Market market share today is
00:19:29.440 that approximately right UB with diio or
00:19:32.080 you talking about the United is the beer
00:19:33.880 compan with di with diio yeah it must be
00:19:38.039 I think they
00:19:38.960 will okay 300 million case indust so now
00:19:41.919 like uh uh the diio has given off the uh
00:19:46.159 less expensive Brands to uh
00:19:48.640 inw earlier their market share would
00:19:50.799 have been about uh close to about 35
00:19:53.400 yeah so now they'll be same about 2025
00:19:56.240 right interesting they didn't want to
00:19:57.640 get very deep into the smaller cities
00:19:59.720 and stuff they want to focus more on the
00:20:01.600 those were the economy segments which
00:20:02.960 makes no profit yeah so what was the
00:20:05.760 opportunity you saw in Goa Brewing what
00:20:08.559 sets you apart from the rest so while I
00:20:12.520 was working I the only thing I used
00:20:15.280 whatever income that I got was to travel
00:20:17.280 so I initially with the small salaries I
00:20:19.559 could travel in Southeast Asia just
00:20:22.080 backpacked and when I finally got to go
00:20:25.240 to the US I think this was somewhere
00:20:26.799 around
00:20:27.640 20134 I was on a flight uh from London
00:20:31.159 to New York and like a United Airways
00:20:34.520 like the cheapest ticket right at the
00:20:36.240 back you know so you know that's like
00:20:38.919 that's and you happy about it that's
00:20:40.840 luxury and I'm sitting there and I'm
00:20:43.120 waiting for the trolley with like you
00:20:44.880 know the with the drinks coming and I'm
00:20:47.640 just very observant of people so I
00:20:49.600 always I was just looking and there were
00:20:51.720 all these kids who looked very hipster
00:20:53.720 hipsterism was in and all the you know
00:20:56.919 uh what do you call the turle Shell uh
00:20:59.280 frames and everybody was picking up this
00:21:01.440 green can and I was just super curious
00:21:03.559 and this is taking so long it's a
00:21:05.919 transatlantic flight so 20 30 minutes
00:21:08.799 down and I'm just waiting and then it
00:21:10.520 reached me and I said do you know what
00:21:12.320 that green can is and she this woman
00:21:15.120 just looked the and she said oh that's
00:21:17.760 the last one it's your lucky day and
00:21:19.559 that was an IPA that I never had an IPA
00:21:22.120 i' worked in liquor for 10 years may not
00:21:24.000 10 years I must have worked in liquor
00:21:25.480 for seven years IPA is Indian P Indian p
00:21:28.840 and I cracked open the bottle can and I
00:21:31.240 poured it had the first sip the burst of
00:21:33.919 hop Aromas and like what authentic craft
00:21:36.279 beer is and I was just like like
00:21:39.440 you know I mean what am I what are we
00:21:41.120 making can you elaborate a bit what is
00:21:42.880 Indian P so it's a very interesting uh
00:21:45.640 story so Indian Pale Ale um was made
00:21:50.320 when the British couldn't ship fresh old
00:21:54.760 beers to India because they would get
00:21:56.679 spoiled on the journey it was on the sea
00:21:59.000 so some Brewers in in uh London decided
00:22:02.120 to increase the alcohol percentage and
00:22:03.840 also add a lot of hops so hops are you
00:22:07.039 know they're antibacterial but the E
00:22:09.440 loves it so from a microbiological
00:22:11.400 standpoint it what hops hops are a uh
00:22:15.120 like it's a bird of a creeper it's very
00:22:18.039 um botanical yeah it's a Botanical plant
00:22:21.159 it's the bitterness and the aroma of
00:22:23.400 beer essentially came from beer soer
00:22:26.159 bitter so the main problem was when you
00:22:28.520 you didn't have temperature control back
00:22:30.520 in the Medieval ages and you still
00:22:32.320 brewed beer
00:22:34.159 you often found the beer turn sour and
00:22:38.720 then the Brewers would just experiment
00:22:40.600 with like the French Brewers would put
00:22:42.200 something and and then somehow someone
00:22:44.279 realize that okay if you put a lot of
00:22:45.880 hops it controls the bacterial uh growth
00:22:49.400 because you didn't have the sanitation
00:22:50.760 of today and you didn't understand
00:22:52.240 microbiology that well so in fact beer
00:22:54.799 was given to you know Farm Workers as a
00:22:57.799 ration because it was healthier than
00:22:59.600 water because water be beer goes through
00:23:02.679 the whole process of getting heated and
00:23:04.320 cooked and so um so the the when this
00:23:07.720 beer started coming to India it was made
00:23:09.640 for India and when Indian breweries got
00:23:12.279 set up I think the first ones in Solen
00:23:14.240 and everywhere this shipping was not
00:23:16.600 needed anymore so the the the style died
00:23:20.120 for almost 140 150 years nobody really
00:23:23.080 even heard of India P I think the Indian
00:23:25.919 pallet uh did not it's not in at all
00:23:28.919 even in the west it died because also
00:23:31.200 it's it's way more bitter than uh green
00:23:34.640 can you had on the aine Indian company
00:23:37.279 or India Pale alses were never made in
00:23:39.440 India until maybe 2015 for cat it's a
00:23:42.679 category like how you have a
00:23:45.520 stout so most of
00:23:49.080 the because it was being shipped to
00:23:51.480 India britishers called it IPA and then
00:23:54.840 in the way like fortified Vines happen
00:23:57.400 same way like they added High proof also
00:23:59.760 it had a higher amount of alcohol in it
00:24:01.640 yeah yeah little but still if you look
00:24:03.600 at the market like IPA like when you
00:24:06.240 want to a Beer Drinker try a new beer
00:24:09.080 they don't usually end up liking an IPA
00:24:11.200 they'll still go for a lger or a hiis
00:24:13.559 because it's more bitter qu what would
00:24:15.799 be the difference between Andy Coffee
00:24:19.559 like we start with milky coffee and move
00:24:21.080 too you know it's the same I think the
00:24:22.880 palette Grows Right like it's the blue
00:24:24.559 cheese and am yeah yeah it's all
00:24:26.279 Evolution and you you know the the
00:24:29.440 category really took off because there
00:24:32.120 were like this very passionate you know
00:24:35.320 absolutely you know authentic Brewers
00:24:38.200 home Brewers in the west coast who
00:24:40.960 decided to start um you know challenging
00:24:43.640 the status quo of these big corporations
00:24:45.440 so the big beer back in the day in
00:24:47.559 America was all mild loggers and
00:24:49.880 everything so these Brewers started
00:24:51.600 making small batches I think and then
00:24:54.799 the style that became very popular was
00:24:56.799 IPA and it was invented by the
00:24:58.919 Brewers like Stone Brewing Lagunitas the
00:25:01.679 first generation craft Brewers and they
00:25:03.760 also came with that great culture where
00:25:06.080 they were really trying to they were
00:25:08.120 also contemporaries of like you know the
00:25:10.000 tech companies and you know very open
00:25:11.640 work culture happening in the west at
00:25:13.240 that time so this was like on the beer
00:25:15.760 Direction so that's how IPA uh became
00:25:19.640 popular so how did that relate with you
00:25:21.960 starting go Brewing Company so I had a
00:25:26.559 plan to go and visit like you know
00:25:28.799 friends and travel in the US and see
00:25:31.240 whatnot you know what were you doing
00:25:32.679 back then professionally working I was
00:25:34.600 working at in that that those days I was
00:25:37.240 working in chandigar I think yeah for
00:25:38.880 for perno okay so whatever money I saved
00:25:41.880 I just would use it to so you saw this
00:25:43.760 green can you were like IPA is great
00:25:46.000 kikas then so I read the can I was like
00:25:49.840 this is insane like how can we not make
00:25:52.480 product like this and I was always like
00:25:54.480 thinking within the companies What can
00:25:57.840 you do to create new product I was very
00:26:00.440 like trying to shake the those uh within
00:26:03.640 that organization I just was I think
00:26:06.799 waited I remember like pacing in the
00:26:08.880 flight wanting for the doors to open
00:26:11.080 when I landed I just went to the brewery
00:26:13.000 that made it then I just kept traveling
00:26:16.120 with going from one Brewery to other
00:26:18.480 then I I I must have on that trip of 3
00:26:20.760 weeks I must have gone to maybe two or
00:26:22.799 three breweries a day I didn't even meet
00:26:24.960 my cousins I said like I was totally
00:26:26.720 obsessed by the idea and it was like
00:26:29.200 everyone was very open Friendly the
00:26:31.440 whole culture part of it was very
00:26:33.039 different from how like how Indian
00:26:35.679 liquor companies were very secretive
00:26:37.720 there was very what the M was called
00:26:39.440 copy left like you big thing in alcohol
00:26:42.559 the recipe not so much so Western
00:26:45.480 Brewers just publish their recipes we
00:26:47.320 also are very happy to you know like
00:26:49.559 tell people what what style it is we
00:26:51.360 describe it very in detail I think the
00:26:53.200 Legacy Brands hold it tght it's the like
00:26:56.440 like in
00:26:59.399 ingredient is very very
00:27:01.279 critical like only the chief Master
00:27:03.480 blender it's called as a black book so
00:27:05.799 like we don't share with anyone like
00:27:07.399 only I have it and my blender would like
00:27:09.320 you you are a legacy brand so started
00:27:12.760 you know what I
00:27:13.960 mean yeah okay so if I go to a wine
00:27:17.039 store why do I pick Gua Brewing Company
00:27:20.200 over another beer which is on the
00:27:24.360 counter the first basic differentiator
00:27:27.480 is it you know it is phenomenally
00:27:30.919 different from any commercial beer like
00:27:33.399 say for example I take a king fisher
00:27:35.600 strong I take a Goa brewing beer I mean
00:27:38.200 you could just taste it you will you
00:27:39.799 will immediately realize and how the
00:27:41.760 beer affects you quality is a factor of
00:27:44.360 what in be so we are what we do I can
00:27:47.720 speak you know because the word craft is
00:27:49.840 also very Broad and liberally used but I
00:27:52.640 mean I personally take it with a lot of
00:27:54.919 seriousness and so we are absolutely uh
00:27:58.600 like natural or nothing business where
00:28:00.679 we don't even use any kind of extract or
00:28:02.679 even fruit which has like processed by
00:28:06.039 any Industrial company we would rather
00:28:07.919 go straight and use as much as whole
00:28:10.279 produce as possible so we'll Source our
00:28:12.640 grains we'll work very closely so every
00:28:15.440 part of your um the the beer that you're
00:28:18.519 drinking if you read our label all the
00:28:21.799 ingredients you will be able to know
00:28:23.600 they they all which you would find in
00:28:25.159 your kitchen it's nothing which is
00:28:27.519 industrial or something so that's
00:28:29.640 because we are not really aiming to
00:28:31.720 produce you know One lakh
00:28:34.440 cases from one like you know you're not
00:28:36.679 scaling you're not so the bigger
00:28:38.080 breweries probably would from one badge
00:28:40.039 they would produce 20,000 cases and we
00:28:41.720 would probably produce maybe 6 700 cases
00:28:44.159 from one B so we work on slightly
00:28:46.279 trimmed down equipment we've customized
00:28:48.200 what scale is good enough where the
00:28:50.960 quality doesn't uh get affected and work
00:28:54.760 to make sure that you are so you know
00:28:57.120 you're delivering a product that's that
00:28:59.279 has a very good differentiation at the
00:29:02.240 same time it also you know has that
00:29:04.240 value we are Indians at the end of the
00:29:06.080 if I'm going to pay 20 rupees more I
00:29:08.640 want to taste it I want to feel it you
00:29:10.679 know if I have five bottles of people's
00:29:12.559 ler people say that I it doesn't blo
00:29:14.640 them it's clean the next day is fresh
00:29:17.440 because it's clean in terms of what
00:29:19.200 ingredients go in making it and that's
00:29:20.760 how much does it cost versus King Fisher
00:29:23.000 so our beers would be um so king fisher
00:29:27.720 let's say is about 50 rupe for a 330 ml
00:29:30.200 just to give you a markup we will be at
00:29:33.080 more than that is the pra prices is the
00:29:35.799 cheapest in the country so we would and
00:29:38.279 a Biser would be a 65 and you know so
00:29:41.320 that's it very cheap yeah that's for the
00:29:43.000 for the 330 and we would be at 90 which
00:29:46.000 would be a 20 25% upgrade over the
00:29:48.840 premium category and then we have beers
00:29:52.200 in every category and what margins does
00:29:54.360 a beer company typically work on so you
00:29:56.519 know with extremely high level levels of
00:29:58.440 efficiency if you are producing Mass
00:30:00.279 macro loggers you probably get into the
00:30:02.720 range of between
00:30:04.000 55% and because they also recycle a lot
00:30:06.760 of bottles come back it's it's very
00:30:08.559 efficient in terms of cost structure and
00:30:11.360 it can be stretched all the way to 60
00:30:13.320 but not consistently because you also
00:30:15.360 operate on commodity prices also coming
00:30:18.279 malt prices go up glass prices go up
00:30:20.519 year taxes and all don't taxes is out of
00:30:23.480 your uh cost beond the taxes go up the
00:30:27.320 prices also yeah that's what I'm saying
00:30:29.159 taxes only affect this entire industry
00:30:30.919 from state to state which you realize
00:30:32.919 the Revenue taxes go to the the
00:30:35.360 government I think what cleverly you
00:30:36.840 have done is you have differentiated
00:30:38.559 your product by pricing it higher I
00:30:40.840 think that is the main thing but I think
00:30:42.519 we also a little bit like Carpenters you
00:30:44.640 know to be honest we make it at a
00:30:46.799 certain cost we have a simple very clear
00:30:49.519 idea that this is our margin structure
00:30:51.080 we're not going to touch it we don't
00:30:52.600 want it to be out priced we're not
00:30:54.399 aiming for we want to create great
00:30:56.840 quality product so philosophy of Goa
00:30:59.799 Brewing is is simply you want to create
00:31:03.399 beer which is in the home refrigerator
00:31:06.159 we don't look at any other touch point
00:31:08.279 we don't sponsor bars we bars keep our
00:31:12.720 product for the product quality but we
00:31:14.240 don't pay for entry into any bar like
00:31:17.120 Mini's bar owner run bars would are
00:31:21.320 great support system for us who
00:31:22.840 appreciate quality you know right how
00:31:25.919 big is Goa Brewing Company now in terms
00:31:28.080 of uh sales sales I think we last year
00:31:30.720 we finished with 27 lag bottles in the
00:31:33.200 financial year and the money number for
00:31:35.320 that so in terms of gross sales we would
00:31:37.159 have crossed 20 CR in terms of sale yeah
00:31:39.840 and you've gotten funded also no by DSG
00:31:42.200 so one of the First Investments that you
00:31:44.919 know so that was another long journey
00:31:47.360 into figuring it out so so competition
00:31:50.200 is Bea mainly be is actually a very
00:31:53.240 different uh Play Because be's um be
00:31:57.919 also gets majority of its volumes from
00:32:00.480 the same category as haward's 5000 and
00:32:02.519 Kingfisher strong where it's it's it's
00:32:04.799 the base category where and certain
00:32:07.159 States they really get a lot of volume I
00:32:09.760 think we do not have any kind of
00:32:12.200 a competition as such because I think we
00:32:16.679 fall in the category of Brands which you
00:32:19.919 know consumers really you know take make
00:32:23.039 that effort to even go one stop a to get
00:32:27.000 that product and they will buy a case
00:32:28.679 and they will make sure that because
00:32:30.440 that's the uh the
00:32:32.440 mo interesting enjoy it huh enjoy it
00:32:36.240 thank you do I say sh
00:32:40.320 or okay so we already know about Shar
00:32:43.960 that his
00:32:45.919 youth was focused around going to
00:32:50.399 cocktails uh before though but uh's bar
00:32:54.679 four times a week with four different
00:32:56.159 people yes when did the journey eye
00:32:59.279 witness to a small part of it okay so
00:33:04.279 when did you like get your act together
00:33:06.360 and become a family man the most family
00:33:09.080 is question in the most traditional
00:33:10.760 sense Family Man happened what about 5
00:33:13.080 years back actually met my wife at a at
00:33:15.240 one of my own events but I've always
00:33:18.159 done events so since I was in school I
00:33:20.480 was I was not the best student but I was
00:33:22.880 always involved in organizing stuff for
00:33:26.960 school with friends so I was I've always
00:33:29.360 been an organizer uh so it was a very
00:33:31.919 natural transition for me to be in the
00:33:34.480 industry of
00:33:36.600 entertainment um along the way I started
00:33:39.519 post College I started getting artists
00:33:41.279 down to the country um I Flo in my first
00:33:44.320 company when I was about 17 18 years old
00:33:46.480 where I would get a company called
00:33:48.080 spotted club.com where I would send
00:33:50.120 photographers across bars in Delhi
00:33:52.760 Bombay Bangalore they would take
00:33:53.919 pictures and upload it within 24 hours
00:33:56.639 onto this website
00:33:58.600 and um but I would always create
00:34:00.960 experiences and I realized that the only
00:34:02.919 way I could monetize this was via
00:34:05.200 alcohol Brands so when I was 18 years
00:34:07.440 old I got this artist into the country
00:34:09.440 called Edward Maya for the first time
00:34:11.918 and I was an 18y old had no idea about
00:34:13.918 sponsorships I walked into the bakar's
00:34:15.918 office randomly I stayed in gar I walked
00:34:18.599 into bakar's office I got a meeting
00:34:20.879 through the was really popular in Delhi
00:34:23.800 uh subjective right now let's what do
00:34:26.359 you call popular you want to put him
00:34:28.440 above this right let's discuss that no
00:34:31.480 he was massively connected extremely
00:34:33.960 social like I said that's that that's my
00:34:36.239 mode I just knew how to get people
00:34:38.359 together yeah and I knew how to have the
00:34:40.280 best parties and um but I did not have
00:34:43.719 experience right so I was throwing these
00:34:45.440 amazing parties I was making money of it
00:34:47.800 but at a point of time I had a downfall
00:34:50.639 so I remember these events how old are
00:34:52.399 you know uh I'm 35 yeah I'm 35 there's
00:34:55.480 something about this I have a couple of
00:34:57.040 friends in Bombay and Bangalore who are
00:35:00.359 really cool organizing great events at a
00:35:03.839 certain point in their life they all
00:35:06.320 have a change of heart where what was
00:35:10.359 once really appealing and validating for
00:35:13.280 them stops being validating at around
00:35:16.040 the age of 35 35 40 why is that uh
00:35:19.720 actually for me um I take great offense
00:35:23.040 to this because when I watch some of
00:35:25.800 these guys who are making making money
00:35:28.359 having a good time being very
00:35:31.079 social in many ways doing what they love
00:35:34.560 why do they stop it and then try to do
00:35:37.440 something completely different at a
00:35:39.599 later half of the life I don't think
00:35:40.960 I've stopped it at all at least from
00:35:43.040 personal experience uh I realized very
00:35:44.880 early whatever I do in life I'll have to
00:35:47.240 build my business around it and I could
00:35:49.119 not do a 9 to5 job I was very clear
00:35:52.200 about that I had to be doing something
00:35:55.480 in which I have fun so I had this this
00:35:57.839 one party which did not go very well uh
00:36:00.119 which was a very big talk of town it
00:36:02.079 called it was called o it was a New Year
00:36:03.560 party where we ran out of alcohol
00:36:05.359 organization was not the best in one
00:36:08.200 month's time I decided uh I'm going I
00:36:10.480 was a small partner in a nightclub I
00:36:12.760 sold that off what went wrong um the
00:36:16.319 partnership that I was in at that point
00:36:18.040 time who I partnered with to have this
00:36:19.760 party that did not work out for me and
00:36:22.280 my responsibility was was perfect what
00:36:25.040 what I executed as part of my
00:36:26.880 responsibility
00:36:28.079 was was on point but I'm thinking Delhi
00:36:30.280 someone shot somebody that's the same
00:36:31.800 party I'm talking about oh my
00:36:35.440 God this is a TR no but that's fine that
00:36:38.680 that did happen that
00:36:41.560 F no of course not that's have we don't
00:36:45.280 have uh within one month time haven't
00:36:47.599 ared
00:36:49.960 yet oh God so so within one month's time
00:36:53.760 um I quit whatever I was doing and I
00:36:56.880 joined who's also mentor to me I I
00:36:59.520 joined a company at a very low I was
00:37:02.079 making lots of money but I realized that
00:37:03.920 if I want to do what I want to do for
00:37:05.800 the rest of my life around what I want
00:37:07.800 to do which is entertaining people I
00:37:10.800 have to understand how companies work so
00:37:13.359 I joined rashan Abbas he was running a
00:37:15.359 company called Encompass at that point
00:37:16.640 in time I joined as an assistant manager
00:37:19.280 at a very low salary but the three years
00:37:22.079 I spent there all I did was understand
00:37:25.359 invoicing taxation purchase order
00:37:28.400 um how to vendor management give me the
00:37:31.240 secret recipe to throw a killer party
00:37:33.319 that everybody wants to show up to one
00:37:34.920 line so what I do now is experience so
00:37:38.040 what I learned from that and what I do
00:37:40.040 now is the same thing I'm doing for
00:37:42.319 100,000 people across three cities with
00:37:44.200 one IP that I run called gen Explorers
00:37:46.440 Club it's just cotised right that time
00:37:49.319 financing was I had to sell tickets to
00:37:52.119 finance I to go behind sponsors to
00:37:53.920 finance now financing thanks to these
00:37:55.880 ticketing Partners has become much
00:37:57.160 easier
00:37:58.000 alcohol brands are spending more money
00:37:59.760 on getting experiences people are
00:38:02.119 getting people became more music
00:38:03.599 sensitive they would come for certain
00:38:05.200 acts so basically what I do now it's
00:38:07.920 exactly what I doing back then but I'm
00:38:09.359 more organized and I've built a
00:38:11.200 successful business only focusing on the
00:38:14.079 Alcohol industry so watch brands come to
00:38:17.000 me luxury Brands come to me I say no to
00:38:19.040 everyone what I know very well is
00:38:21.079 alcohol I know how to I'm the I'm their
00:38:23.000 friends right so I work with multiple of
00:38:26.880 his brands I built out one of his gin
00:38:28.720 Brands an important guy if he comes to
00:38:30.880 the bar and says this is a cool bar then
00:38:33.240 you his what he created this gin
00:38:36.200 Explorer Club is one of the most
00:38:38.640 fantastic properties yeah and uh it it's
00:38:41.960 like a carnival music food the alcohol
00:38:45.960 and it's like to a different level like
00:38:47.800 for our Jin also Jessel which is now the
00:38:50.319 largest luxury gin we had a launch in
00:38:53.680 his GC and immediately it became popular
00:38:57.119 so what he has created is so at that
00:38:59.560 time also uh people were not okay Brands
00:39:02.440 were not okay with partnering an event
00:39:04.839 where other brands were involved so we
00:39:06.839 were fortunate enough to get all the Gin
00:39:08.640 Brands together back then the first GC
00:39:11.240 at Olive at Olive that was so beautiful
00:39:13.599 myv actually uh GC started when Anand at
00:39:16.480 anand's bar so that's where the idea of
00:39:18.480 GC started when there's a there's a gin
00:39:20.839 boom which was going on because cocktail
00:39:23.280 we were actually all the same founder
00:39:25.560 of I know but that being said now gin
00:39:28.040 Explorers Club will not only be gin
00:39:29.520 Explorers Club we we'll be dropping Jin
00:39:32.400 and we'll be entering more categories
00:39:34.440 under the same Festival tequila is
00:39:36.200 something which I'm very passionate
00:39:37.640 about tequila is it really blowing up
00:39:39.760 like we think or is it only in the
00:39:41.160 affluent circles globally it's blowing
00:39:43.680 up India will always be uh in the
00:39:47.200 affluent but as the aswr report now it's
00:39:51.520 it's actually growing three times which
00:39:53.040 is a very but on a very small base so
00:39:55.119 it's like saying one glasses have now to
00:39:58.200 but it's growing faster than everything
00:39:59.720 else right but the volume base is very
00:40:01.720 small and it's only the top level
00:40:03.599 Tequilas which are growing because if
00:40:05.480 you see the lower level Tequilas they're
00:40:07.280 not selling at all so we're still a
00:40:08.960 whiskey market like we we will be a
00:40:10.640 whiskey market for a really long time so
00:40:12.800 so you run food talk India which is the
00:40:14.960 largest food community in India that's
00:40:16.839 how we started off but right now I'm
00:40:19.520 focused on Anthem which is a marketing
00:40:22.079 agency agency which focuses on the ALCO
00:40:24.720 industry under that we have an IP called
00:40:26.720 gen explorers club and I've service
00:40:28.839 perno diio all these brands that do
00:40:31.079 their marketing strategies activations
00:40:32.839 events MH and along the way I built a
00:40:34.880 beverage brand called Jade Forest
00:40:36.240 because I wanted to be in the in the
00:40:38.800 space so I was like I I can't create my
00:40:40.800 own alcohol so I created a mixer brand
00:40:42.920 why can't you create your own Alcon it's
00:40:45.119 expensive um at that point of time I
00:40:47.760 actually sat with Lama also uh at a
00:40:49.920 point in time to create my own alcohol I
00:40:51.960 was just scared uh red tapism every
00:40:54.800 state has their own excise duties uh um
00:40:58.160 and even while I run an alcohol agency
00:41:00.880 people look at you very differently even
00:41:03.200 when I go and apply for a license for a
00:41:04.880 cocktail
00:41:09.480 Festival but they look at you in a very
00:41:12.040 different different way you're the
00:41:13.920 shadiest of the lot yeah always but now
00:41:17.640 it's
00:41:18.880 changed where are you hanging out
00:41:22.200 of who changed we're talking about
00:41:26.119 larger sense of the word
00:41:28.000 still very taboo I mean India always
00:41:30.400 been taboo we've it's still a dark
00:41:32.839 Market what that means is that you can
00:41:34.359 still not advertise our it's all
00:41:35.760 surrogate so we are under surrogate
00:41:37.599 that's what I realized that that's what
00:41:39.160 I want to do because it's a dark market
00:41:40.720 right I want the marketing in fact one
00:41:42.760 of the biggest amazingly genius move on
00:41:45.079 his they can't spend anywhere else right
00:41:46.960 yeah and amazingly we'll come to this as
00:41:48.920 a topic because see at the end of this
00:41:51.560 episode we want to tell young people how
00:41:55.680 to have a job in alcohol alcohol how to
00:41:58.040 build a business around alcohol how to
00:42:00.800 create
00:42:01.800 cool alcohol
00:42:04.800 Brands ancillary cocktail mixes wherever
00:42:08.400 the opportunity is last but not the
00:42:10.640 least abishek I have to preface
00:42:13.839 abhishek's
00:42:15.480 introduction uh so we are a very small
00:42:18.640 miniature partner to abishek in his
00:42:20.599 business as a equity partner it's a
00:42:23.280 investment that has done very well for
00:42:25.760 us uh we' never spoken about it publicly
00:42:28.640 but we have spoken like privately many
00:42:31.599 times about it I think it's 1.6
00:42:34.839 1.7%
00:42:36.359 pre no no from the open market I think
00:42:39.760 close to 500 crores you're holding I
00:42:41.559 think 400 crores 400 near 400 crores of
00:42:44.559 abishek stock radico which is a great
00:42:46.680 investment for me so uh nice don't blame
00:42:50.000 me for being a bit nicer
00:42:54.559 to investment
00:42:58.599 that's how this is working like you have
00:43:00.880 vegetarian you have cavar I can't see
00:43:03.880 the
00:43:05.520 caviar but tell us abishek you have
00:43:08.000 Legacy in this industry I read I didn't
00:43:10.400 know but 70 years really no actually um
00:43:14.640 see our company was formed by the Goen
00:43:16.960 Brothers in
00:43:18.160 1943 and then um 1973 my dad uh bought
00:43:23.440 it over from Mr Sanjay
00:43:25.280 Dalia and uh so from from 1973 our
00:43:28.720 family is into the alcohol business and
00:43:33.040 u i studied in modern
00:43:35.160 school and I always say I'm in the
00:43:37.839 business of making people happy in
00:43:40.760 Bangalore you were in boarding school
00:43:42.079 right no modern school was in Delhi and
00:43:44.400 then College in Bangalore then College
00:43:45.960 in Bangalore H so from for me from the
00:43:50.319 beginning of my school days I always
00:43:53.200 wanted to create a brand I love alcohol
00:43:56.280 M that's why I'm happy because I
00:43:58.119 practice what I preach so I love each
00:44:00.640 kind of alcohol and um by Nature I
00:44:04.800 wanted to become a CA But as God had it
00:44:08.319 in store for me is my mom didn't wanted
00:44:11.280 me to do four years of CA and then uh
00:44:14.160 two years uh 3 years of college then
00:44:16.440 four years of CA then 2 years of MBA so
00:44:19.839 I landed up in
00:44:21.240 Bangalore uh for my
00:44:23.240 engineering and uh I think the kind of
00:44:27.680 homework I did there by visiting all the
00:44:30.880 pubs everything paid me very well I
00:44:34.319 think Bangalore has been my biggest
00:44:36.559 inspiration of what radico is today
00:44:40.640 because Bangalore is always known as the
00:44:42.800 PB City and every street had its own Pub
00:44:47.880 and uh the liquor consumption that time
00:44:51.800 was like that time liquor consumption
00:44:54.040 was not like an fmcg it was more like
00:44:56.440 you know it was the takar system where
00:44:58.200 you push your material it was not a
00:45:00.680 consumer's choice but Bangalore was the
00:45:03.000 only city where you could see the liquor
00:45:05.720 as an fmcg so I did my engineering there
00:45:09.839 and uh then in 1996 I finished my
00:45:13.559 engineering and everything which could
00:45:15.880 go wrong happened to me I was that time
00:45:18.400 I think 22 so we had a separation in our
00:45:21.760 family my father were four brothers and
00:45:25.119 we got rampur disty
00:45:27.720 that time I think the turnover of the
00:45:29.559 company would be about 70 crores and I
00:45:32.599 had a liability of 50 crores and the
00:45:35.480 profit would be kind of zero and what
00:45:38.079 year was this this was in
00:45:39.839 '96 that's the time I joined business
00:45:42.960 also we had a bottling contract with one
00:45:45.280 of the uh leading players in India which
00:45:48.000 got over so my entire Revenue system was
00:45:50.559 over company was kind of in losses with
00:45:53.599 50 crores liabilities so that time I
00:45:56.079 went to one of the his
00:45:57.839 bottlers with that and uh he made us
00:46:01.760 wait for 5 6 hours and wanted us take in
00:46:05.160 the company so that's the time I went to
00:46:07.800 Dad I said
00:46:12.160 dad now our back is against the wall and
00:46:16.000 I really want to create a brand and let
00:46:18.400 me try and do it so that's the time as a
00:46:21.599 company we decided to get into
00:46:23.800 Brands and um the one of the biggest
00:46:27.800 task for me was to change the name of
00:46:29.520 the company so the company was called
00:46:31.800 rampur Distillery and chemical company
00:46:34.680 and uh this I was 22 we had 11 uh
00:46:40.000 foreign companies in India that is the
00:46:41.640 time that there was a myth the amount of
00:46:43.440 scotch consumed in India is more than
00:46:46.200 what is bottled in Scotland and here a
00:46:48.920 22y old guy coming no Mone nothing
00:46:52.440 totally like it was a it was a different
00:46:54.760 scene so first of all it took
00:46:57.520 me three four presentations to my the
00:47:01.040 senior team and the age was all high I
00:47:03.599 was 22 they were all 40 50 years old so
00:47:06.880 I changed the name of the company from
00:47:08.400 rampur diser and chemical company to
00:47:11.000 radical ra of rampur di of distill and C
00:47:14.359 of company so that's how radico came
00:47:16.280 into uh
00:47:18.359 existence and uh but by the way I love
00:47:21.160 this part of the story wherein I find
00:47:24.119 this in many Industries I'm going into
00:47:26.200 invest
00:47:27.800 uh we have this Western baggage in India
00:47:32.280 where innately Indians believe that if
00:47:35.040 the product is foreign it's better like
00:47:37.599 I was telling you earlier AB we still
00:47:39.880 sell Indian clothing which is probably
00:47:43.440 better quality with foreign models on
00:47:45.440 the face of it so when I saw this
00:47:48.000 company which was making alcohol called
00:47:50.319 ramper and jasel mayir in some cases
00:47:53.599 which was not even aged as much as the
00:47:56.599 SC spsh counterpart selling for more
00:47:59.280 than that and people would call me and
00:48:01.520 be like when we spoke about alcohol they
00:48:04.520 would be you will only get it in the
00:48:06.559 dutyfree and only sometimes otherwise
00:48:09.440 rampur whiskey will be sold out so I was
00:48:11.319 enamored from the very beginning in
00:48:13.839 terms of how has a Indian brand been
00:48:16.599 able to pull that off I feel that way
00:48:18.440 for all Industries not just
00:48:20.280 alol sometimes I'm sure your bigger
00:48:23.079 Market in in your earlier years of
00:48:25.079 products like rampur would be
00:48:26.319 International
00:48:27.280 right and not no I uh I'll come to
00:48:30.200 rampur a little later but um so that's
00:48:33.559 the time like what we did is because
00:48:35.559 monies were limited so and you had to be
00:48:38.559 pan India else your marketing Buck would
00:48:41.400 go waste so I hired a team of 100 people
00:48:45.920 the average age of my team would be 24
00:48:48.960 but what I thought if I get experienced
00:48:51.040 guys they'll ask me a lot of salaries
00:48:53.960 second they would not agree to what I am
00:48:56.319 saying so my average age was very less
00:48:58.799 so my uh payout was less then literally
00:49:02.079 I went to 10 people begging them that
00:49:04.559 please bottle for me but I didn't I
00:49:06.400 could not put up capex so it's
00:49:08.319 Outsourcing C- packing what you're
00:49:09.760 saying so I said uh I'm 22 I'm 22 and a
00:49:13.760 half I want to create a brand blah blah
00:49:15.839 blah I'm not going to run away so please
00:49:17.799 bottle so I got 10 people to bottle for
00:49:20.040 me and then in 98 8th August 98 we
00:49:23.520 launched our first brand 800 p.m whiskey
00:49:26.559 and and luckily like I know the ad was
00:49:28.799 very famous it was the best one of the
00:49:30.359 best ad of the century the India
00:49:32.280 Pakistan ad the this thing it was
00:49:34.799 nominated as one of the best ads what
00:49:37.240 was the ad remind me it was a border ad
00:49:39.720 it was two
00:49:40.839 generals and uh then at the clock strike
00:49:44.799 the cannon goes up the clock strikes and
00:49:47.440 then they pass the whiskey it's called
00:49:49.240 as time for friends it's very popular ad
00:49:52.880 so so that's how we started then from 98
00:49:56.200 to 20 6 we mapped out that which are the
00:49:59.559 lowly sectors the economy segment or the
00:50:01.880 popular segment the mass market and we
00:50:05.280 became from 0 to 10 million cases what
00:50:08.480 is that in money
00:50:10.319 terms 10 million
00:50:14.720 cases that would be what a turnover of
00:50:17.799 about 600 700 800
00:50:20.880 crores
00:50:22.520 800 so that is what we did and uh that
00:50:26.960 was
00:50:27.880 fascinating then the most important
00:50:30.480 which was the turnaround in our this
00:50:32.599 thing is uh I was in Vegas and for me
00:50:37.880 all the good ideas either come after
00:50:39.680 8:00 p.m. or at bars because I think
00:50:42.440 that is my biggest learning that's my
00:50:44.799 that's that's where I can see the
00:50:46.079 consumers what they want yeah you you
00:50:48.160 interact at the either at the bars or at
00:50:50.559 the shop have you guys been to his home
00:50:52.720 in
00:50:53.480 Delhi not not his home invited us
00:50:57.319 I've got seven bars he lives like Batman
00:51:00.680 what so I went we had an idea of
00:51:03.520 starting a tequila brand with a certain
00:51:05.559 famous person I took a bunch of friends
00:51:08.079 to his house recently for
00:51:10.000 dinner outside of all the alcohol that
00:51:13.280 might have been in his house so I went
00:51:15.799 in the hotel taxi right and we were
00:51:18.160 going back so when we were leaving
00:51:20.440 abishek sent a Rolls-Royce a Bentley and
00:51:24.280 one or two other cars like that and we
00:51:26.599 went in like a posy of cars and I was
00:51:29.599 like what is going on and my Inova which
00:51:32.160 was from the hotel was following me from
00:51:33.680 the
00:51:34.760 back Bangalore versus
00:51:41.640 Delhi Bangalore also have lot of people
00:51:44.400 much more
00:51:45.480 than that is also
00:51:48.440 different so that I would get it so
00:51:51.760 anyway so I was in Vegas so there what I
00:51:54.799 saw that people were ordering watka on
00:51:58.520 the table greos and the whole Trend was
00:52:03.160 changing because earlier you never used
00:52:05.799 to show your bottle off so you know the
00:52:08.400 the bottle has to be a piece of art what
00:52:10.400 I realized and the concept came that you
00:52:13.480 know there was a ice bucket the bottle
00:52:15.119 was there and people were proud to put
00:52:17.200 the bottle on the table so I said we
00:52:20.079 need to create a watka and we want to go
00:52:23.240 and
00:52:24.119 prize so that's the time
00:52:27.200 I came back I wanted a decorated bottle
00:52:30.520 but we didn't have money to get the
00:52:31.960 machine so so I think no one knows this
00:52:35.280 so I went I met up with kabadi walas so
00:52:39.440 the first bottle of magic which was
00:52:40.960 produced was dipped in asset with a
00:52:42.920 paper label and it looked like a frosted
00:52:46.280 bottle and everything so magic was born
00:52:48.839 in 2006 then it kept on innovating and
00:52:52.920 uh today we are proud because I always
00:52:55.599 believe that 20 5% of the global market
00:52:58.640 is vka in India at that time it was only
00:53:01.880 2% now it's changed to four the watka
00:53:05.079 consumers are basically the younger
00:53:06.920 generation that is youngsters and women
00:53:10.119 which if you see our demographics year
00:53:12.280 on year every year like 15 million
00:53:14.720 people are going to come into the
00:53:15.880 drinking age so I thought that is the
00:53:18.400 right thing to do so that's how magic
00:53:20.839 came and today we are proud that magic
00:53:23.480 is the seventh largest vodka in the
00:53:25.160 world and India out out of all the vkas
00:53:29.880 starting from a regular to a Grey Goose
00:53:32.960 or a Koffman 60% of any vka sold is
00:53:36.440 Magic wow fantastic so that has been one
00:53:39.880 of the turning points for us and then
00:53:43.119 what happened is we we had morphus which
00:53:45.280 is the largest premium Brandy so even if
00:53:47.839 you see the packaging what I believe if
00:53:49.640 the packaging what someone was saying
00:53:51.280 like packaging is the first thing which
00:53:53.760 attracts uh to a consumer second is the
00:53:57.599 most important the blend has to be good
00:54:00.040 and when you actually make a brand is
00:54:02.760 when people are proud to have that
00:54:05.559 sitting together they're not shy away
00:54:07.960 even if they like the product they like
00:54:09.680 to display it then in
00:54:13.400 2014 is um UK and India always have this
00:54:18.280 uh tussle that uh Indian whiskey cannot
00:54:21.400 be called as a whiskey because it's not
00:54:23.920 aged and that's the time if you see all
00:54:27.480 the new age malts whether yamazaki Etc
00:54:32.000 were gaining ground earlier like
00:54:33.960 yamazaki never used to get sold today if
00:54:36.920 you go go to buy a 15 or a 18 21y old
00:54:40.880 yamazaki won't get it in the market each
00:54:43.000 bottle is more than a lak of rupees for
00:54:45.480 a 25 would be I think about 2 and a half
00:54:48.040 three lakh rupes and then they also
00:54:49.599 removed the they have an
00:54:51.359 allocation they called me in the please
00:54:53.680 buy us a bottle amaki 18 a bottle but
00:54:57.400 also in fact I was in Hedonism a bottle
00:55:00.880 of yamazaki 55 guess how much was it
00:55:03.480 retailing for no idea any guess 50 lakhs
00:55:07.559 must be 6 and a half CR wow and people
00:55:11.440 actually buy yeah absolutely it's crazy
00:55:13.880 I'm telling you I chines like art yeah
00:55:15.960 it's like art the Chinese no price but
00:55:18.359 art you don't
00:55:20.640 drink no but nowadays if you see wine
00:55:23.400 and mold it appreciates it appreciates
00:55:26.359 and people are reselling there a
00:55:27.839 reselling situation bars actually get
00:55:30.839 invited to these closed rooms sessions
00:55:34.359 invested in barels like few of the these
00:55:37.400 auction houses I
00:55:38.799 think auction houses so that's the time
00:55:42.119 we created in 2016 our rampur single
00:55:44.920 malt and uh today we have seven
00:55:47.280 Expressions the cheapest is $100 a
00:55:49.400 bottle and in fact lately uh uh we had
00:55:53.359 400 bottles of chairman Reserve first
00:55:56.319 bottle was uh in London it was sold for
00:55:59.599 1 lakh which got re auctioned for 2
00:56:01.359 lakhs so we had saved some bottles which
00:56:03.720 is now uh in Hyderabad dutyfree and
00:56:06.480 retailing at 5 lakhs a bottle and it
00:56:08.640 sold out yeah there's now I think only
00:56:10.480 two
00:56:11.400 left 400 bottles yeah so that's 20 CR of
00:56:14.480 sales no no I start I started with one
00:56:17.319 right but in the end there were three
00:56:19.319 four bottles left which we sold which is
00:56:22.039 now detailing at 5 lakhs there's a good
00:56:23.839 Insight on the market like when we are
00:56:25.920 priced ing products across category
00:56:29.240 where like if 400 Indians are willing to
00:56:31.280 pay 5 lakh rupees a bottle they can pay
00:56:33.960 20,000 for for a
00:56:36.119 shirt absolutely indian-made
00:56:39.799 watches as far as we can push this
00:56:42.520 needle of Indian craftsmanship and the
00:56:46.160 ability of the Indian Artisan in every
00:56:48.520 Department I feel like you know like
00:56:51.280 enough of white stuff here why not our
00:56:54.480 stuff sell there culturally we're more
00:56:57.520 creative anything n what I'm saying with
00:57:00.720 especially our prime minister yeah the
00:57:03.520 Indians the kind of respect the kind of
00:57:06.240 Aura Indians have you know earlier they
00:57:08.920 used to doubt the quality of Indian
00:57:10.640 product but today India commands one of
00:57:13.680 the biggest uh premiums that is why like
00:57:17.039 a single malt is on allocation and uh we
00:57:20.599 also launch like taking from your Jin it
00:57:23.839 can be always debated whether Jin was
00:57:25.799 invented in England or Holland but Jin
00:57:29.760 and tonic was the invention of India in
00:57:33.720 1910 you'll be surprised when there was
00:57:35.880 a malaria outbreak so the britishers
00:57:38.960 what they did they uh they had to have
00:57:41.720 uh this quinine so they mixed quinine
00:57:44.960 with lime water and andin in the end and
00:57:49.400 yeah soda then they added Jin so Jin and
00:57:52.920 tonic is the creation of India that's
00:57:55.240 why every tonic water is Indian tonic
00:57:57.520 water and how big is radico
00:57:59.720 now see radico now is uh like our turnov
00:58:04.520 last year was about 4,200 crores and uh
00:58:09.559 market cap is close to about 22 23,000
00:58:13.280 CR I I read in the news somewhere that
00:58:15.920 abishek had become a billionaire on
00:58:17.799 Forbes how did that feel what changed
00:58:20.200 see being a billionaire Etc is all
00:58:22.079 numbers it's all Market but in the end
00:58:24.720 what is more important that the Indian
00:58:26.440 products going abroad create that name
00:58:29.680 like our Jin Jessel rampur because
00:58:32.599 numbers will keep changing so that does
00:58:35.119 not give me a kick once the products
00:58:37.640 become Global and respected I think
00:58:40.319 that's the main kick about that value
00:58:42.599 that value change okay so now that the
00:58:44.599 introductions are over we'll get into
00:58:46.920 the meat of what we were here to discuss
00:58:49.640 the intent is to find young people out
00:58:53.760 there want to be entrepreneurs
00:58:57.160 and tell them how they can get a job in
00:59:00.319 owning a bar starting a liquor company
00:59:03.480 working in a liquor company doing
00:59:06.119 advertising for liquor
00:59:08.039 companies uh this seems to be such a
00:59:11.079 large ecosystem with so many
00:59:13.480 opportunities but nobody I looked up
00:59:16.240 online I searched a
00:59:18.119 lot no one has articulated the A to Z
00:59:21.559 Journey when somebody gets interested
00:59:23.640 and starts working earning a buck from
00:59:25.559 this industry
00:59:26.760 in a very tangible comprehendable manner
00:59:29.520 so we'll try and attempt to do that so
00:59:31.280 before we talk about opportunities in
00:59:34.480 this industry maybe a good place to
00:59:37.119 start is by establishing how big the
00:59:39.240 industry is which part of it is growing
00:59:42.440 faster than other parts and uh then try
00:59:45.799 to narrow in on what somebody looking to
00:59:47.960 begin here should do would you say the
00:59:51.000 hard liquor Market in India is about $40
00:59:54.359 billion
00:59:56.319 no no much more you think liquor hard
00:59:59.079 liquor 40 million billion 40 billion 50
01:00:01.720 billion is total Market size and beer is
01:00:05.039 about 12 billion yeah about 1230
01:00:07.599 something like that so the interesting
01:00:10.200 thing is in India is the only country in
01:00:12.440 the tropical Zone where you do roughly
01:00:15.960 around 350 million cases of heart liquor
01:00:18.720 considering you also country regular
01:00:21.400 Spirits also and about the same quantity
01:00:23.599 of beer but if you compare it to Vietnam
01:00:26.359 which is on the same heat temperature
01:00:29.680 distance Vietnam does 300 million cases
01:00:32.160 of beer but only 30 million cases of
01:00:35.119 hard liquor so we are extremely over
01:00:37.680 indexed on hard liquor why I think one
01:00:39.760 of the key reasons is I think if you
01:00:41.440 look at the psychology we have to look
01:00:43.920 at India Urban India is very unlivable
01:00:47.240 and one of the big you know the the
01:00:49.559 consumption U you know categories that
01:00:52.599 these uh the imfl category gets its
01:00:55.400 volumes from is the post work going home
01:00:58.000 period which in the traditional liquor
01:01:00.760 Palin you call it charar moment like
01:01:02.960 four people working in different jobs
01:01:04.839 would come together sit at a small take
01:01:07.640 enjoy have that one break and then go
01:01:10.400 home to the and and you know look at the
01:01:12.400 transit times within City so you have
01:01:14.119 really short of time so this moment of
01:01:17.480 like maybe taking a little break from
01:01:19.520 your routine is very short hence the
01:01:23.000 consumption style and pattern has also
01:01:25.079 been developed around this so what
01:01:26.799 happens is we are extremely over indexed
01:01:29.520 on the 180 ML nip so what is n so in
01:01:33.240 terms of pack sizes I think 80% of the
01:01:36.480 it is like is a full bottle which is and
01:01:40.160 the 375 and 180 ml is a nip so they call
01:01:43.799 it PA so what happens usually in the say
01:01:47.200 up to a level of a semi- premium segment
01:01:49.599 that is up till say a royal stag yeah so
01:01:52.160 you'll see guys will meet at a place a
01:01:55.559 it's called
01:01:56.799 they'll buy a nip AATA
01:02:00.599 a per per room so there they'll take a
01:02:04.839 nip and they'll finish it and then go
01:02:07.240 home for work but so go home for uh
01:02:10.240 meeting their wives or anyone so that so
01:02:13.640 it's basically summarized as bang for
01:02:15.279 your buck A lot of times this happens so
01:02:17.319 it's you have 1 hour if you drink two
01:02:19.880 beers the high that you get the high
01:02:22.400 that you get versus you drink
01:02:26.559 prium lior it is different but for the
01:02:28.920 is the biggest because they like to get
01:02:30.400 high which is surprising which is
01:02:32.319 surprising like it nowhere in the world
01:02:34.880 80% would be strong nowhere nowhere what
01:02:38.520 do people drink for is it to
01:02:42.000 escape is it to escape the monotony of
01:02:46.039 life is it to get a
01:02:48.279 high is it cultural in the sense that
01:02:51.480 it's a activity that you like doing
01:02:53.559 along with your friends and family
01:02:56.440 why why does India drink it's also D
01:02:59.440 broken up into segments the Country
01:03:01.799 Liquor drinking class they for them it's
01:03:04.920 price point and they want to get high at
01:03:06.839 the lowest cost um what do you think no
01:03:09.279 I'll change there like I studied in
01:03:10.720 Bangalore so say the he's talking about
01:03:12.839 the Country Liquor or the lowest segment
01:03:15.400 so you'll be surprised these guys go to
01:03:18.720 work at 8 a.m. you know they do physical
01:03:22.839 labor I've seen them because I used to
01:03:25.240 have in my DMS College the industrial
01:03:27.359 engineering start to break the hammer
01:03:29.079 and everything like that you know so
01:03:31.520 6:00 you'll see that guy in a liquor
01:03:34.680 shop and how they drink it is amazing
01:03:37.680 they'll take a nip is called a spwa in
01:03:40.760 Hindi so they'll take it boom and then
01:03:43.920 they'll go for work it's so physical
01:03:46.480 after their work they'll again come back
01:03:48.240 have one more and then go home and sleep
01:03:50.079 and no need of a mixer no need of a
01:03:51.680 mixer if they pick it up of 50 rupes now
01:03:53.640 or 40 rupes that that's a typical
01:03:55.960 percentage alcohol is this uh 28% no
01:03:58.520 this is
01:04:00.279 42% no no it depends like you have 26 36
01:04:03.799 and 4 so recently I've done a Content
01:04:06.200 series on Country Liquor and i' which is
01:04:08.880 doing very well for me so I've actually
01:04:10.480 picked up Country Liquor from all over
01:04:11.920 the country and I've been uh tasting
01:04:13.880 them and they don't taste as bad because
01:04:15.559 of the low ABV although they have
01:04:17.319 synthetic flavors in it what is ABV
01:04:19.599 alcohol by Vol alcohol by volume uh
01:04:21.760 which is not strong so a typical whiskey
01:04:23.880 which would be a 40% uh ATA which is
01:04:26.480 your country made liquor is 28% so you
01:04:28.279 can drink it directly versus whiskey but
01:04:30.200 that you need a
01:04:32.039 mixer and they have all those local
01:04:37.000 flavors all that it's very different
01:04:39.160 it's the local local Flavors of India
01:04:41.839 names like whatever like fun I think
01:04:45.480 these are fun names I think that'll be a
01:04:47.319 fun content piece if and I had one which
01:04:50.079 tasted just like sambuka like you put it
01:04:52.720 you put sambuka and you put this other
01:04:54.680 country made liquor will not be able to
01:04:56.240 tell the difference this doesn't sound
01:04:58.640 necessarily like a good thing right
01:05:01.319 somebody gulping 180 ML it's not it's
01:05:04.359 not it is not it it is irresponsible
01:05:06.680 drinking but they don't have any other
01:05:08.359 option right uh Mass level drinking it's
01:05:11.039 it's to get high to answer your question
01:05:12.880 it's mostly to get high quickly for the
01:05:15.480 money that You' spend what is the
01:05:16.680 psychology behind wanting to get high
01:05:19.960 why is this laborer who is making let's
01:05:23.559 say 800 rupees a day to go and lift
01:05:26.400 something for 8 hours or 10 hours or 12
01:05:29.680 why does he want to get high at the
01:05:31.119 beginning of his day it's the same
01:05:32.520 psychology that a corporate CEO probably
01:05:34.599 comes home and has a whiskey at home
01:05:37.200 before they get sit down on the dinner
01:05:38.839 table it's the same psychology you are
01:05:40.440 tired you want to get away you want to
01:05:42.720 spend your day not thinking about maybe
01:05:45.079 work and socializing or talking to your
01:05:47.279 friends or your work friends whoever you
01:05:48.920 talk to but from that point of view it
01:05:51.279 is that break they they want to they
01:05:53.559 don't want to like because their life is
01:05:54.960 so tough they don't want to just yeah
01:05:56.599 it's physical labor it's taxing I mean
01:05:58.920 they have enough issues I feel like I
01:06:00.880 think it's it's a lot of that I mean as
01:06:02.799 part of diio per we did a lot of rounds
01:06:04.880 in many many liquor stores permit rooms
01:06:07.960 and one of the biggest learnings was
01:06:09.720 that why are they sitting here and
01:06:11.039 drinking is because they all need to get
01:06:13.119 home in half an hour and then start that
01:06:15.720 whole day again this is one break you
01:06:17.680 got in the whole day where you could get
01:06:20.240 away with your friends or whoever you
01:06:21.559 drink with I mean that's irrespective
01:06:23.319 you can drink alone and still find you
01:06:25.119 know that
01:06:26.119 so I think it's that right because we
01:06:29.400 can't go around this question do you
01:06:32.760 think alcohol net net for society is
01:06:36.039 good or bad and explain why make a case
01:06:40.440 on this side and on the
01:06:42.079 other I mean you are
01:06:44.440 talking I'll give you see anywhere where
01:06:48.119 alcohol is banned whether it was us Etc
01:06:52.039 it has L the economy into shambles
01:06:55.799 yeah what she's rightly saying drinking
01:06:58.160 alcohol in moderation is very good
01:07:00.039 you're talking Kennedy time boot
01:07:01.920 leggings even the doctor say a glass of
01:07:04.480 wi or 60 ml a day is very good for the
01:07:07.480 heart so I think anything in moderation
01:07:09.960 is good so what you're saying is
01:07:12.279 culturally alcohol has been a part of
01:07:15.119 our life centuries and if you ban it
01:07:18.359 what happened in US prohibition the
01:07:20.599 money from alcohol will not go to you
01:07:22.799 guys but it'll go to the dark elements
01:07:25.920 but that being said if um I don't I'm
01:07:27.839 not very good with the numbers of
01:07:29.319 America but the younger generation that
01:07:31.559 I tend to engage with once in a while
01:07:34.880 they're not drinking as much as we were
01:07:36.279 drinking when we were younger at least
01:07:38.279 they were not drink they're not drinking
01:07:39.760 as much as I would drink when I the
01:07:42.279 Young Generation in India also maybe
01:07:44.039 they don't have
01:07:45.400 foures they're doing other things to get
01:07:47.839 high but they're still getting high but
01:07:49.359 they caring about calories they're
01:07:50.960 caring about hangovers compared to what
01:07:53.680 we would we didn't have those
01:07:54.920 alternatives interesting point do you
01:07:57.400 guys individually believe that you
01:08:00.319 become a different person a slightly
01:08:02.200 different version of yourself absolutely
01:08:04.480 AB how do you Chee it's a chemical
01:08:06.520 reaction in your body I mean this is
01:08:08.160 finally it's not just a product in the
01:08:10.200 air right I'm not consuming fashion
01:08:12.599 through my eyes I'm actually consuming
01:08:14.599 it in my body so it is actually changing
01:08:16.920 there's a molecular change that you go
01:08:18.399 through when you have alcohol so how
01:08:19.880 does minaki change I I mean I get more I
01:08:23.319 I love to dance and I love great music I
01:08:25.198 like to put I mean some of us have seen
01:08:27.600 us very drunk but we've had some great
01:08:30.439 nights and you also also at at any point
01:08:33.799 in time whenever you are drinking you
01:08:35.640 are your guards are down like I said
01:08:37.439 right so you are more open to knowing
01:08:39.839 people and talking to people when you
01:08:41.319 are say having a drink versus not having
01:08:44.158 a drink I think I become funnier uh I
01:08:47.120 become more social and I become more
01:08:49.560 chatty abishek I've seen love
01:08:53.759 yeah see I always say I'm the business
01:08:56.198 of making people happy so I become
01:08:58.719 happy same I think you know largely to a
01:09:01.679 to a great extent but more of also
01:09:04.640 sometime you also want to consume
01:09:06.960 something on your own personal space as
01:09:08.920 well like just you know in the unwind
01:09:11.479 moment that's also something which is
01:09:13.319 very interesting but very specific then
01:09:16.120 you know okay so we established that the
01:09:18.439 hard liquor Market is 40 billion beer is
01:09:21.080 12
01:09:22.520 billion so we have some data that says
01:09:25.839 that correct me when I'm wrong UB has
01:09:30.479 25% market share followed by spirit and
01:09:35.080 beer together Country Liquor has 20% no
01:09:40.279 actually if you see 400 million in terms
01:09:43.120 of value term I'll tell you the thing
01:09:44.679 value terms yes not volume 400 million
01:09:48.158 is the hard liquor M so 400 million
01:09:51.158 cases Country Liquor would be again a
01:09:54.158 300 million cases mark
01:09:56.360 but maybe not uh in numbers 51% isue so
01:10:00.600 value would be very less revenue revenue
01:10:03.080 would 51% won't it be Country Liquor no
01:10:06.120 no much much less 20% your state data is
01:10:08.400 correct much less because the the value
01:10:10.679 is very less Val low yeah okay follow
01:10:13.760 maybe followed by diio at 17 aner Bush B
01:10:19.520 record radical ketan 3% no we we of the
01:10:23.560 market size we're about 10%
01:10:27.560 right so what did these brands do
01:10:31.120 correctly which somebody
01:10:34.000 can use to emulate somebody can build
01:10:37.440 around if you had to talk about
01:10:39.520 underlying Trends in the Brewing space
01:10:43.640 uh what is changing today that I should
01:10:46.560 focus on imagine I am a 25 year old who
01:10:50.040 has managed to raise 10 CR rupees and I
01:10:53.280 want to start a liquor brand
01:10:55.960 should I do tequila should I try and
01:10:58.520 figure out what UB is doing correctly I
01:11:01.239 had an interesting conversation with an
01:11:03.880 ex executive at UB who
01:11:06.920 said that off late they've been trying
01:11:09.520 to push hinin instead of KF and it's a
01:11:13.080 strategy that has not worked yes and
01:11:15.480 they're falling back on selling KF again
01:11:17.800 exactly something on those lines yeah
01:11:19.920 silver King henen silver was their MO
01:11:23.360 right same thing which happened like if
01:11:24.760 you see the Wars which happened with
01:11:26.800 thumbs up and Coke yeah so what do I do
01:11:29.360 I have 10 CR rupees that I have raised a
01:11:31.520 venture capital fund has given me the
01:11:33.800 money I want to start a lior liquor
01:11:36.280 brand what should I
01:11:37.719 start so I deal with these young people
01:11:41.520 on a daily basis who want to start a
01:11:43.960 liquor brand when you talk about numbers
01:11:46.719 and market share most of these kids do
01:11:49.880 not know their numbers and they don't
01:11:51.840 want to go into building a tequila or
01:11:53.480 building a gin because they want to
01:11:54.960 capture market share they they want to
01:11:57.480 create a product they want the first
01:11:59.679 thing that they want to create is they
01:12:01.600 want to create a differentiated product
01:12:03.440 which is the first thing that they come
01:12:04.480 up with saying that oh My Gin has hem
01:12:07.520 seeds in it that's why I'm different or
01:12:09.920 my tequila has this certain type of
01:12:11.639 agave that I'm importing in that's why
01:12:13.560 I'm Different they don't go in with the
01:12:14.920 mentality saying that oh I want to
01:12:16.679 capture 50% market share of the Gin
01:12:18.440 category in the country number one
01:12:20.639 number two they feel that the Indian
01:12:22.560 brands or the international Brands which
01:12:23.880 are there they can do a better job in
01:12:26.159 packaging positioning marketing compared
01:12:28.760 to these bigger players thirdly they
01:12:31.960 feel is become much easier compared to
01:12:34.679 what it was before that okay I know a
01:12:36.400 friend who knows a co-packer all I have
01:12:38.360 to go and do is create a recipe I don't
01:12:40.960 want to be a manufacturer I want to be a
01:12:43.120 brand owner and I want to be a
01:12:44.760 distributor versus going into the entire
01:12:47.000 capex model can you manufacturer bro on
01:12:52.080 your own with 10 CR rupe Capital that
01:12:54.280 I've raised you
01:12:55.920 set you can set up a
01:12:58.320 distill with but most your money will go
01:13:00.960 into you
01:13:02.440 cannot too
01:13:04.360 less I think you can I raised my first
01:13:07.120 round was eight cror and we spent almost
01:13:09.199 six in kex because we really wanted the
01:13:11.880 best equipment to brew but that was the
01:13:14.080 whole journey that came to the point
01:13:16.400 that you know we' done all everything
01:13:18.400 that we could and then you only needed
01:13:20.480 the money so with six CR rupees in
01:13:22.639 equipment you can start a independent
01:13:25.120 beer company in India but the the
01:13:27.760 journey to the six CR is not see the
01:13:30.000 money is the least important thing in
01:13:31.920 this whole Matrix I think one of the
01:13:33.679 most important things is you once you
01:13:37.880 the what you are trying to do has to
01:13:39.760 fully resonate with you like how
01:13:42.000 minakshi has been running her bar for
01:13:45.239 day in day out for years and you keep
01:13:47.120 getting better at what you do by being
01:13:50.120 at it what if I I don't know what
01:13:52.400 resonates with me I want to find from
01:13:55.159 the lens of capitalism the lwh hanging
01:13:57.360 fruit of today so one of the I'm okay
01:14:00.440 with going to a co-packer I don't have
01:14:02.000 to manufacture I don't have to spend
01:14:03.679 money on
01:14:04.760 that what brand and what price point
01:14:08.840 what category category the question is
01:14:10.800 category and I would say the highest
01:14:12.760 category is whiskey and I would say that
01:14:15.560 and stuff like that would be your most
01:14:18.199 profitable category and by far is the
01:14:21.360 one that actually has test the test of
01:14:24.199 stood the test of time as well like I've
01:14:25.760 seen people set up with 30 to 50 lakh
01:14:28.159 rupees how their money is spent U maybe
01:14:31.880 10% is spent on creating the brand the
01:14:34.360 balance goes into actually paying uh
01:14:37.080 listing fees uh in every state so they
01:14:39.520 usually start off people from Goa they
01:14:41.840 started from Goa then they go to either
01:14:44.280 Delhi or gura and I'm talking about Jin
01:14:47.000 as a category because that's a space I
01:14:48.639 know um in Delhi you have to pay per
01:14:52.159 brand which will be about 12 lakh rupees
01:14:53.880 for vodka and Jin that's where most of
01:14:56.000 the money is going initially go to
01:14:57.920 market 30 to 50 lakh rupees people can
01:15:00.120 start off their brand initially through
01:15:02.560 a C- Pacer if you want to start the
01:15:04.520 journey is really long answer your
01:15:08.000 question you have to have sixc every
01:15:10.159 year so we are not talking
01:15:13.440 about one no no but then I'm just saying
01:15:16.199 You' set up about no no what about like
01:15:18.800 I'll tell you like in our industry if
01:15:21.239 you want to go all India you have to
01:15:23.480 have 35 bottling units right then it's a
01:15:26.360 dark environment so it depends on the
01:15:28.480 category so with such a small amount you
01:15:31.000 can only make a mark If you go into a
01:15:32.719 niche category which I'm fine doing yeah
01:15:34.840 which only you get into a niche category
01:15:36.840 right there also you have to the most
01:15:38.960 important is you have to have the
01:15:41.520 patience because what I feel to get the
01:15:44.440 first 10,000 consumer is the toughest
01:15:48.000 that is the biggest Journey which we
01:15:49.440 I've seen in all my Brands because once
01:15:52.000 that 10,000 are loyalist consumers will
01:15:55.159 talk to they'll make 50,000 consumer
01:15:56.920 then Millions comes that's happened with
01:15:59.159 each of my Brands it goes slow but then
01:16:01.360 it just takes off so the minute you push
01:16:03.760 your brand and the most important
01:16:05.920 industry is the payment the minute you
01:16:09.760 push your primaries and you don't look
01:16:11.560 at your secondaries and tertiaries the
01:16:13.760 brand is finished what is primary
01:16:15.520 secondary tertiary primary is suppose if
01:16:17.280 I give to a distributor then secondary
01:16:19.760 is when it goes to the retail the most
01:16:22.280 important is the tery is the retail oft
01:16:25.360 any retailer will take your material but
01:16:27.040 till the time it does not go out he
01:16:29.840 won't not making any money till the end
01:16:32.400 the biggest problem don't pay in our
01:16:35.639 industry what makaki is rightly saying I
01:16:37.719 Echo her what she's saying with a six CR
01:16:40.679 fun you it's it's like if you click it
01:16:44.120 you're a God but you should have that
01:16:46.440 capital of at least 50 crores Etc but he
01:16:49.239 did it with 10
01:16:51.120 fantastic so I have one
01:16:54.960 about alcohol beer is a different
01:16:57.080 category I'm I'm open to
01:16:59.400 beila Jan anything so I've looked at
01:17:01.960 even Alan story and these other gin
01:17:03.840 Brands they didn't start off they first
01:17:05.480 they were going to co-packers and no no
01:17:08.000 C- Packer wanted to bottle their product
01:17:10.000 right they were if you go to copac and
01:17:12.239 tell them if I come to you and tell you
01:17:13.600 I want to build 750 cases in a year no
01:17:16.560 they'll say that's too less for me right
01:17:18.639 so that's the main thing that you have
01:17:20.120 to start small which co- Packer should I
01:17:23.040 go to any names recommendations people
01:17:25.840 who have repute so I think co- Packers
01:17:29.480 there are many you should probably
01:17:31.280 choose a market where the resistance the
01:17:34.159 friction to get your product to the
01:17:36.400 consumer is the least so don't go to
01:17:38.760 markets where there is very high
01:17:40.800 regulation Goa we were you know an
01:17:43.679 entire ecosystem I think please come to
01:17:45.320 Goa I think Goa has great co-packers Goa
01:17:48.000 has great C- Packers also extremely um
01:17:51.320 so the there are two three types of
01:17:53.159 markets that happen in India Goa is
01:17:55.239 considered an open market like
01:17:56.639 Maharashtra where you have a distributor
01:17:58.960 it it almost operates very similar to
01:18:02.159 say any other business like you have you
01:18:04.840 have the freedom to do if you are in
01:18:06.520 Karnataka you have to sell to the
01:18:08.120 government so you have much higher
01:18:10.000 control so as a I don't want to get into
01:18:12.000 the complexity of different states cuz I
01:18:14.040 think there are too many rules but are
01:18:15.520 you talking about liquor or you're
01:18:16.639 talking about beer either anything I
01:18:18.760 think both are different uh in Goa
01:18:21.600 getting a co-packer is easier getting a
01:18:24.800 name a C- Packer somebody somebody of
01:18:26.440 repute U greater than and you know there
01:18:28.520 are a bunch like there are 30 greater
01:18:30.159 than is a C- Packer it is being made at
01:18:33.520 one of the factories also model they
01:18:36.080 started from there also model is that
01:18:37.679 you go to coopaca and if you if the
01:18:39.800 coopaca doesn't have the still that you
01:18:42.159 want to use in order to make your
01:18:43.840 product since the coopaca has all the
01:18:46.360 licenses which is actually the majority
01:18:48.080 of the C the cost Bigg work the biggest
01:18:50.400 work the biggest headache of your fire
01:18:52.199 your chemical you have multiple licenses
01:18:54.400 where initially if you want to raise
01:18:55.520 money to build your own distillery
01:18:56.840 that's where your money will go is when
01:18:58.600 you import a Ste put it give it to your
01:19:00.480 coper and tell him to use this still to
01:19:03.000 make your product yeah and then get a
01:19:04.840 good distiller yeah so when you say
01:19:06.760 bottler do you mean caca yeah yeah same
01:19:09.760 thing can I find a C- Packer for whiskey
01:19:13.040 yeah yeah you can So for anybody for any
01:19:15.360 Spirit any Spirit yeah so then I don't
01:19:18.600 need that much money right if I'm using
01:19:20.280 a co-packer and making whiskey this
01:19:22.480 recipe how do I go about getting it what
01:19:24.719 what is it I remember Kiran Kiran had
01:19:27.280 this license in beer brewing whatever
01:19:29.679 she studied
01:19:31.080 microbiology she spoke about
01:19:33.760 how the recipe is such an important
01:19:36.560 ingredient absolutely I don't know
01:19:38.480 anything about liquor I have raised 10
01:19:40.840 crores from a venture capital fund I
01:19:43.440 have a broad plan in mind I go to a
01:19:46.080 coopaca blue ocean somebody equally
01:19:48.679 relevant we'll put out names at the end
01:19:50.960 of this podcast with some research we'll
01:19:52.679 take it from you yeah who are good co
01:19:54.880 backers Second Step recipe how do I find
01:19:57.880 a recipe you'll get a consultant most
01:20:00.159 people get a consultant on board you
01:20:02.120 either get a diser for example I I mean
01:20:04.719 just giving you an example again because
01:20:06.280 we know these guys greater than an husha
01:20:08.679 was made by by somebody who was making
01:20:11.199 Jin in in uh they came back from bomb
01:20:14.400 safire right so the legacy is Big what's
01:20:16.320 their name I don't I wouldn't know their
01:20:18.400 name but I I know the lady I met her so
01:20:21.960 we'll put we'll put the stuff you go two
01:20:23.840 ways either you get a consultant on
01:20:25.360 board who will take you through this
01:20:26.320 entire process or you get a master how
01:20:29.080 do you find a consultant who will take
01:20:30.440 you through the process difficult to
01:20:31.880 find in India no it's not difficult to
01:20:34.040 find a consultant Consultants you'll get
01:20:35.880 but the consultant will also help you
01:20:37.560 get a master distill from another
01:20:39.400 example they went to proof and go proof
01:20:41.679 and Co is a globally International
01:20:43.520 well-known company that consults Brands
01:20:46.480 to create brands also uses proof and Co
01:20:49.280 yeah so proof and Co was had used it and
01:20:51.440 when they came to India they were
01:20:52.560 already existing as a as a bottling unit
01:20:55.239 mostly out of manisa right and then they
01:20:58.080 actually created thein with proof and Co
01:21:01.360 proper um you know guidance through like
01:21:03.880 the entire recipe creating the entire
01:21:05.520 story everything was out there so how do
01:21:07.719 I meet these people how do I have this
01:21:09.719 dialogue see we we want a particular
01:21:12.199 outcome at the end of this conversation
01:21:14.600 we want a road map wherein so many young
01:21:17.880 people at least like a couple of them
01:21:21.400 raise 10 crores build liquor companies
01:21:24.320 hope hopefully one day become as
01:21:25.840 successful as radico and Indian alcohol
01:21:28.800 Finds Its place in the global ecosystem
01:21:32.080 because young people coming in will
01:21:33.639 experiment do different things it will
01:21:36.560 improve the alcohol of the the quality
01:21:39.560 of alcohol best way like even when I was
01:21:41.520 building my non-alcoholic beverage band
01:21:43.400 you have to pick up the phone call up
01:21:44.800 people from the industry show there are
01:21:46.920 many trade shows I would say like
01:21:49.320 there's Berlin bar convention in India
01:21:52.480 there's bruis and spirits that happens
01:21:53.880 in uh in Bangalore multiple places have
01:21:57.239 now this is this is the thing right
01:21:58.960 India has very few trade only
01:22:00.840 conventions when it comes to liquor like
01:22:02.600 AAR is a huge thing but mostly focused
01:22:04.719 on food and fmcg food right but alcohol
01:22:07.800 has very few of these um where you
01:22:10.239 actually meet people who are creating
01:22:11.840 stuff like the the bottler is standing
01:22:13.920 there trying to sell and say that come
01:22:15.960 to me and make the brand with me I will
01:22:18.120 give you the best price so you have to
01:22:19.960 put yourself out there definitely travel
01:22:22.280 there are many many trade shows that
01:22:23.719 happen and we can give give you again
01:22:24.920 names for that and of course the biggest
01:22:27.360 of the shows are the BCBS and the London
01:22:29.440 cocktail weeks of the world which which
01:22:31.199 bring a lot of people together and you
01:22:33.199 will have distillers bottlers creators
01:22:35.440 blenders and investors in one room but
01:22:38.120 that again is not India Centric I think
01:22:39.960 India Centric is only India is very few
01:22:42.239 I think I I mean I don't know how many
01:22:43.880 you I think see let's let's break it
01:22:45.800 into two three parts number one to
01:22:48.560 create an alcohol brand what does it
01:22:51.239 take it takes a great blend which is the
01:22:53.520 most important
01:22:55.000 it takes packaging Innovation and
01:22:58.520 thirdly the space you want to be so any
01:23:01.080 guy who's starting has to be passionate
01:23:03.520 like her thing if she started sidecar
01:23:05.760 she was passionate else to win the top
01:23:08.040 Asia bar and World bar is not a joke and
01:23:11.480 make assumption they are passionate
01:23:13.199 people so then they should know which
01:23:14.679 segment where is the global industry
01:23:17.239 does it work for the Indian pet or not
01:23:19.719 so even if these shows are happening
01:23:21.639 abroad somebody from here can go there
01:23:23.600 attend buy
01:23:25.360 tickets
01:23:27.719 they with HR you can get lot of blenders
01:23:31.120 who have worked for blenders with HR
01:23:34.159 like HR firms who have passed Dio P
01:23:37.199 porno P XYZ there lot of consultant
01:23:39.840 consultant retired people have created
01:23:41.480 successful PL so you can get people
01:23:43.120 there second is to identify the right
01:23:46.480 product I think that is where the where
01:23:49.880 the art of the youngsters will come in
01:23:51.719 like sers has been started by younger
01:23:54.120 generation this is my next question so
01:23:56.239 now that you figure out a bottler who is
01:23:58.199 also a co-packer you figure out the
01:24:02.080 formula I I'll leave yeah the recipe
01:24:04.440 yeah recipe the re call formula so I
01:24:06.440 think you
01:24:07.880 simply if you want to start for the for
01:24:10.719 somebody who's just starting now I think
01:24:14.040 one of the simplest things one should do
01:24:16.280 is first go to the Super spend a lot of
01:24:19.080 time in Supermarket just keep observing
01:24:20.920 the Shelf do nothing the trend just let
01:24:23.719 people come shop at the supermarket see
01:24:25.880 what's moving on the counter observe
01:24:27.920 talk to Consumers just be in that zone
01:24:30.480 old school go to go to the bar sit at
01:24:32.960 the bar keep seeing what's happening
01:24:34.880 give it time then you will come with the
01:24:37.120 inspiration which is you know that it is
01:24:39.199 differentiated it's not coming from some
01:24:41.199 knowledge of somebody else Western
01:24:43.560 knowledge never works in India we like
01:24:46.280 every pin code in India I say we have a
01:24:48.400 culture code it changes it's it's
01:24:50.679 phenomenally bizarre so you have to be
01:24:53.679 very sure about what you are inspired by
01:24:57.119 and you have understood a sense of the
01:24:59.400 market by being there looking and
01:25:01.520 feeling it yourself that's the first
01:25:03.199 step then you are inspired than all the
01:25:05.600 other things so if you are a brewer it's
01:25:08.080 you know you simply it's the most
01:25:10.040 collaborative open we have so many home
01:25:12.920 Brewers who come to us conventions that
01:25:15.639 happen anyone who wants to make can join
01:25:17.920 these conven we have an East Library we
01:25:19.800 always offer East trains to people we
01:25:21.679 give small mold batches to people who
01:25:23.320 want to go and try you don't need more
01:25:25.199 than 5,000 Rupees to create a small home
01:25:27.440 brewing kit at home experiment be on the
01:25:30.080 kitchen s give it that time once you
01:25:32.400 know the product whatever you're trying
01:25:34.159 to make there's so much learning
01:25:35.679 available online also then you know
01:25:37.239 which one which consultant to go to or
01:25:39.320 then when you go to these fairs you are
01:25:41.400 a lot more better prepared so I think do
01:25:43.360 that homework this industry requires you
01:25:45.840 to put your head down and work hard it's
01:25:47.760 a slow moving industry it's the nature
01:25:50.960 of the business where you have to put
01:25:52.600 that time to figure out the product
01:25:54.520 first don't keep it for later because
01:25:57.199 that's something that you will have to
01:25:59.000 you will put all your energy behind so
01:26:01.760 because you guys are experts in this
01:26:04.360 where do you think I'll come to each one
01:26:05.960 of you individually where is the
01:26:08.400 opportunity today I'll ask you in terms
01:26:11.119 of surj can tell me this kind of beer
01:26:15.360 made with this kind of ingredient at X
01:26:17.920 price point with maybe why story maybe
01:26:20.760 you can tell me
01:26:22.520 tequila made from whatever Agave extrao
01:26:26.800 being sold at 5,000 rupees how to make
01:26:29.040 that happen you can tell me based on
01:26:31.199 what you're seeing in your bar as
01:26:34.199 something where the demand is growing
01:26:36.199 exponentially and abish can tell me who
01:26:38.639 can build a competitive product to what
01:26:41.760 is selling best at radico in the least
01:26:45.840 tumultuous way as possible but is the
01:26:48.280 goal of this question to become a
01:26:50.199 billion doll business or is it to build
01:26:52.440 something that you're passionate about
01:26:53.840 something that it's profitable in nature
01:26:55.520 yeah okay it doesn't have to have the
01:26:57.400 scale of a billion
01:26:58.880 dollars uh anyways okay got it so we
01:27:01.639 start with take a second to think about
01:27:04.280 it who would like to go first
01:27:06.960 idea price point product category so I
01:27:11.679 think one of the best opportunities
01:27:13.400 right now is if you think about large
01:27:15.560 multinationals the value which is
01:27:18.280 available in the Indian Beer Market I'll
01:27:20.000 only speak about beer right now lies in
01:27:22.719 the category where the Indian consumer
01:27:24.880 slowly upgraded from the King Fishers of
01:27:27.400 the world now to a Budweiser or Hut
01:27:29.520 they've already come to a 20 25% this is
01:27:32.280 currently roughly around a 55 to 60
01:27:34.440 million Cas industry that's the price
01:27:36.880 point where you actually make money
01:27:39.280 proportionate to the investment and
01:27:42.000 everything so it's it's it delivers
01:27:43.600 better margin if you now can take this
01:27:46.080 consumers who already here so the
01:27:47.520 consumer iology is that that that
01:27:49.360 consumer wants something better take it
01:27:51.800 to a destination product there may be
01:27:54.199 multiple destinations so you can upgrade
01:27:56.280 a consumer who's seeking quality is
01:27:58.159 always a great starting point I think
01:28:00.360 look at price elasticity don't go to
01:28:03.560 100% markup on a existing large category
01:28:06.520 category building is absolutely not
01:28:08.760 possible in so what you're saying is
01:28:11.480 take the premiumize consumer who has
01:28:14.199 moved from KF to hinin who is willing to
01:28:16.719 pay couple of hundred bucks for and that
01:28:18.679 consumer is going to be far more willing
01:28:21.600 because he's seeking or she's seeking
01:28:23.480 this product quality as a driver and and
01:28:26.800 they will be more than willing to come
01:28:29.280 and upgrade so there is a constant uh
01:28:31.520 Journey that's that's accumulated to a
01:28:33.560 large enough pool now
01:28:35.880 minaki I know what I'm going to say it's
01:28:38.400 has to be bourbon whiskey uh coming from
01:28:40.239 two three things um that I really
01:28:41.960 believe in uh India I mean and again
01:28:44.760 coming from the fact that we are talking
01:28:46.400 cocktail consuming cocktail the way
01:28:49.280 consumption is growing it is one of the
01:28:50.920 biggest drivers of the way consumption
01:28:52.520 is happening in India uh again again
01:28:54.760 Urban centers more so than rural but
01:28:56.800 then again tier 2 as well there are many
01:28:58.400 many cases and great restaurants and
01:29:01.000 bars opening in tier 2 as well and you
01:29:03.080 can see that the major driver of
01:29:04.840 consumption is through cocktails um why
01:29:07.600 bourbon whky specifically for cocktails
01:29:10.040 I'm coming to that is because cocktails
01:29:12.960 were actually created in America they
01:29:15.040 were their American invention and then
01:29:18.000 and hence because bourbon whiskey is a
01:29:20.199 whiskey that was created in America um
01:29:22.760 has not been tapped into to as such as a
01:29:25.639 base spirit in India as much as it can
01:29:28.639 we have Jim Beam which is now being made
01:29:30.360 in India which is completely sweeping
01:29:32.920 through the cocktail Market every bar
01:29:35.119 that you go to right now is actually
01:29:36.600 pouring Jim Beam in their old fashioned
01:29:38.679 whiskey stars all of the M Min julips of
01:29:41.320 the world right and what it's doing is
01:29:43.800 that it doesn't have an Indian
01:29:45.040 alternative so even if I want to use the
01:29:47.480 best of Indian whiskies most of them
01:29:49.159 actually emulate Scotch because that is
01:29:51.480 our way of kind of taking the Scotch
01:29:53.360 whiskey product ction process forward
01:29:55.560 right what the difference between
01:29:56.800 bourbon and Scotch so Scotch biggest is
01:29:59.159 the difference is of course Scottish and
01:30:01.000 American but other than that there's a
01:30:02.679 big production difference in fact taste
01:30:05.159 wise also there's difference so there
01:30:06.280 it's sweeter so bourbon whiskey is much
01:30:07.760 sweeter than Scotch whiskey primarily
01:30:09.679 because 51% of corn is used to make a
01:30:12.280 bourbon whiskey so hence it's sweeter in
01:30:14.520 taste when you actually do a comparative
01:30:16.760 also the way it's finished it's actually
01:30:18.280 finished and there is a little bit of a
01:30:19.719 Char of the bourbon the CK in which it's
01:30:22.080 made it's actually made in New s so the
01:30:24.920 CK itself has a little bit of that Woody
01:30:27.040 churny Burnie flavor which works really
01:30:30.040 well for Indian palette and we feel very
01:30:32.400 very strongly that so far many have
01:30:34.239 tried actually beam Global has launched
01:30:36.719 a whiskey which they're seeing is very
01:30:38.400 much like a bban whiskey it's not to say
01:30:41.080 that the big guys are already not in it
01:30:43.280 but I feel an Indian true Indian person
01:30:46.880 like Indian brand has not really
01:30:49.880 ventured there because a whiskey is
01:30:51.760 intimidating a that you don't money
01:30:54.440 issues like we if we say that we don't
01:30:56.560 have a capex issue and we don't have an
01:30:58.000 aging issue I mean I'm I'm assuming all
01:30:59.880 of these things are in place the
01:31:01.600 investment is in place does it have to
01:31:03.600 be aged is Jim Beam aged yes minimum two
01:31:06.400 years that's what bourbon's claim is you
01:31:08.480 in India given that you minimum three
01:31:10.080 years but but also being a hotter
01:31:12.560 climate it's as hot as as as the bourbon
01:31:15.719 but bourbon does it have the GI tag like
01:31:17.400 scotch has a GI te we don't have to call
01:31:19.159 it bourbon whiskey we have to call it an
01:31:21.159 Indian it's we don't want to call an
01:31:23.360 Indian whiskey bourbon whiskey that
01:31:24.880 defeats the purpose of it you're talking
01:31:26.840 that it will be a change in the blend
01:31:29.800 it's a flavor like a bourbon rampur we
01:31:32.320 are using bourbon CK we using three so
01:31:34.480 if you do yeah so X bourbon CK will be
01:31:36.480 much more refined version of making the
01:31:39.119 same thing we talking about sweeter corn
01:31:41.760 we talking about getting into we're
01:31:43.560 getting into the entire production of it
01:31:45.360 we're not just finishing the whiskey
01:31:47.239 with it so and I feel of course pricing
01:31:49.159 has to be pouring which basically means
01:31:50.920 it has to be valuable to me as a bar
01:31:53.440 owner what is the number so anything
01:31:55.320 between 1200 to, 1400 not above that and
01:31:58.280 approachable to Young interesting people
01:32:00.639 are getting into the category you know
01:32:03.320 Fresh So what is happening to the
01:32:04.920 younger ones are that back in the day I
01:32:06.800 think we all got into alcohol with old
01:32:08.639 monk I hate saying the back in the day
01:32:11.119 world actually but most of us have
01:32:13.280 actually started 40 so but what happens
01:32:16.840 you look it thank you my skin Delhi skin
01:32:20.840 Delhi skin I bang both are glowing as
01:32:24.719 well what's going on we will tell you
01:32:27.040 later coming back to the price point
01:32:30.040 yeah so anything between 12 and 1400 an
01:32:32.239 entry level yeah so I would fully say
01:32:35.600 there there has to be entry level um a
01:32:38.400 lot of the younger immediate after LDA
01:32:40.920 legal drinking age actually gets into
01:32:43.480 this category so they either drinking
01:32:45.480 Jin which is at a greater than price
01:32:49.199 slash badi price I mean in that I'm
01:32:51.920 trying to think about a rum which is in
01:32:53.719 that that category so you know Makai I
01:32:55.639 mean the the coring category that we
01:32:57.480 talking about so whiskey in that
01:32:59.840 category still is owned and run by the
01:33:02.840 the mnc's that space is because also
01:33:05.760 it's very intimidating it's hugely
01:33:07.400 expensive you know the whole deal it's D
01:33:09.719 we just launched our kohu Reserve Ram at
01:33:11.960 that price point you know what in
01:33:15.360 same we need to use the whiskey to make
01:33:18.400 cocktails to get we not talking whiskey
01:33:20.159 consumer I'm not going to sell it to
01:33:21.960 Consumer brand called bangalow bangaluru
01:33:24.159 and I make a bourbon tasting whiskey at
01:33:27.800 13400 bucks and come to minakshi and say
01:33:31.080 try this try beam yeah if mine tastes
01:33:34.560 okay or better you'll take it of course
01:33:36.719 I will it will be there's if you get the
01:33:39.600 packaging see it's a great you have to
01:33:41.800 find The Sweet Spot in that mix so it's
01:33:44.880 good story good blend you cannot
01:33:47.119 absolutely not um you know just discount
01:33:51.400 the recipe the process the whole art of
01:33:54.480 it as well because you cannot say I just
01:33:56.520 packaging is such a big part today it it
01:33:58.960 is huge it's huge like how you sell it
01:34:00.960 like what are you going to say about it
01:34:02.480 if you say it's a bourbon like whiskey I
01:34:04.480 I'll be like okay like so basically you
01:34:06.560 emulated a whiskey which is made in us
01:34:09.440 but you have to have your own original
01:34:11.199 story somewhere bangaluru sounds like a
01:34:13.159 nice bring it out of the
01:34:14.560 Hat you get a good because because Mai
01:34:17.880 from that space right for a product like
01:34:19.719 this you'll need the advocacy coming
01:34:22.000 from the bartender to replace it in an
01:34:24.760 old fashion right I need to be like
01:34:27.159 fully it has to be very and also usually
01:34:29.520 a lot of us which is a lot of us fully
01:34:32.600 back Indian good Indian Brands right so
01:34:35.480 if you are making a good Indian brand
01:34:36.960 which is maybe selling or not selling I
01:34:38.679 will fully list it give it that chance
01:34:41.360 after that it sells or does not sell or
01:34:43.360 people that is like the secondary
01:34:45.360 tertiary sale conversation which can
01:34:46.840 happen later but at least the entry
01:34:49.159 point you will you will have it better
01:34:51.679 if you are an entry also again as a
01:34:53.840 Founder right as a co-founder founder
01:34:55.600 you if you're going out to them and
01:34:57.480 talking to people you have to sound like
01:35:00.480 100% convinced and behind the brand like
01:35:02.560 that's important right that's the that's
01:35:04.119 the meat of it so if you are not like
01:35:05.920 you're like oh I just need to make money
01:35:07.159 I'll be like okay like no no I I will
01:35:09.239 feend passion very quickly when my
01:35:11.719 bangaluru wh keys out okay if you call
01:35:14.560 it bangaluru I don't know
01:35:17.960 how hyper local is essentially what you
01:35:21.239 can say that you we we so or how about
01:35:24.800 we call it like a area instead of even
01:35:27.480 not I mean I'll tell you what we call it
01:35:31.800 J like we' done it you see if you see
01:35:35.040 rampur we've taken all the Indian names
01:35:37.480 to the world and India like rur
01:35:39.320 fantastic your Jessel may now we
01:35:42.040 launched the first time any Indian
01:35:43.920 company at a Scotch price Royal Ram B
01:35:46.440 the brand has really taken off it's one
01:35:48.239 of the largest going to be one of the
01:35:49.760 largest it's all IND names I I mean we
01:35:52.440 have a menu called dear Deli which was
01:35:54.320 actually made and which actually got us
01:35:56.000 to this massive I think Global
01:35:57.800 recognition is because of that menu
01:35:59.400 because the menu was made out of all the
01:36:01.719 places and local spots that us as Delhi
01:36:04.920 people know and it's not to say
01:36:06.719 everything was named after the tombs and
01:36:08.480 the historical places there was a drink
01:36:10.600 called du special so people who actually
01:36:12.760 know du special are the only people who
01:36:14.840 know like who know du right because
01:36:16.520 that's the bus that actually goes around
01:36:18.080 and it's called special and what's a
01:36:19.480 good way to get Word of Mouth out I
01:36:21.400 start a whiskey called bangaluru 14 bu
01:36:24.159 meet BB yeah meet your stakeholders so
01:36:27.000 retailers your bar owners your partners
01:36:30.440 you have to get your partners the the
01:36:32.159 the bar Community for this product is a
01:36:34.320 very big push so there's a very
01:36:36.719 interesting story the founder of perno R
01:36:40.119 his name was Paul Raa and he used to say
01:36:43.719 he started in the southern town of Mars
01:36:47.159 where he made a product which was called
01:36:49.040 rard in his name so he had a philosophy
01:36:51.639 it said make a friend a day so he would
01:36:53.639 take his case of RA go to one bar in M
01:36:56.560 every day and offer a little sampler to
01:36:59.400 every person who was sitting there and
01:37:00.800 they would sip by the end of the year he
01:37:02.760 was in 360 bars and every person was
01:37:05.040 drinking pastis or the was saying Paul
01:37:08.320 is my friend he makes this product I'm
01:37:10.280 drinking it and he took over that
01:37:12.159 business started as simply as that this
01:37:14.520 is possible so Indian equivalent Indian
01:37:17.040 equivalent to something similar indan
01:37:19.400 equivalent to that sort of indian spirit
01:37:21.880 made by an Indian founder and
01:37:24.040 to Bar definitely is greater than you
01:37:27.199 guys like you have done the see you
01:37:29.480 cannot
01:37:30.560 discount put into Reta and expect it to
01:37:33.360 fly right
01:37:35.679 interesting shuch would you like to go
01:37:40.320 next us usually usually what ends up
01:37:43.320 happening is that a Brands come to me
01:37:45.560 and they like okay we have this product
01:37:47.080 we don't know what to do with it please
01:37:48.960 help us out is what I end up usually
01:37:51.639 writing strategies for a lot of brands
01:37:54.040 uh but personally um I think
01:37:57.119 two one is rum I I believe strongly Ram
01:38:01.280 is a category I think India has has
01:38:03.840 grown up on old Monk and post old monk
01:38:06.320 there's not been too much disruption uh
01:38:09.040 in the rum Market globally uh you have
01:38:11.440 zakapa and such Brands which are doing
01:38:13.199 extremely well and all bartenders
01:38:16.119 globally are working with rum what was
01:38:18.880 Jin a few years back is now RAM and
01:38:20.639 Tequila so I believe um a great flavored
01:38:25.280 rum at a premium price at a semi premium
01:38:28.760 price point will what is semi- premium
01:38:31.599 1,200 same pricing onwards not an old
01:38:34.599 mon really agree with you 12200 onwards
01:38:38.119 uh I believe in that as a flavored drum
01:38:40.440 flavored as in you can have different
01:38:41.800 expressions of it you can have a spice
01:38:43.119 rum I'm actually I love I love
01:38:47.520 Captain so good zakapa is one of my
01:38:50.080 favorite uh rums but there not too many
01:38:52.880 options here recently there have been
01:38:54.800 some Brands coming out of maai is there
01:38:57.920 satara is there and now you're launching
01:39:01.040 Kami kamikara I not tried kamikara but
01:39:05.480 I'm saying Ram as a so there's
01:39:07.960 interesting thing on you know rum as a
01:39:10.800 category the consumer so there is two
01:39:13.360 things whiskey has laddering in terms of
01:39:15.360 price so whiskey consumer starts at say
01:39:18.239 the Imperial blue level and then goes to
01:39:20.239 Royal stack blender sprad 100 Pipers
01:39:22.119 Shivers as the person grows in life so
01:39:24.480 whole storytelling is about like you see
01:39:27.040 all the campaigns are all it's your life
01:39:29.480 make it large
01:39:32.920 OB I don't know what but
01:39:36.679 it's it's all about God you didn't
01:39:40.040 take I of course so but in rum rum sells
01:39:43.920 a lot in the East West Bengal um you
01:39:46.840 know orisas the so rum has a is is is a
01:39:51.119 product where the consumer doesn't even
01:39:53.480 relate to this image so that it's not
01:39:56.719 for status Seekers so it's a very
01:39:59.040 different psychological product category
01:40:02.320 you know you would find a great musician
01:40:04.560 drink Ram in Goa in India it's almost
01:40:07.960 equivalent to how Jack Daniels has a
01:40:09.840 subcultural kind of a Vibe throughout
01:40:11.920 America does that commun it's very
01:40:14.320 Community strong strong personality not
01:40:16.119 too social but believes so you can
01:40:18.719 upgrade rum but you need to do it with a
01:40:20.960 great product story I think you need to
01:40:22.800 upgrade the consumer who's very
01:40:24.159 different from a whiskey consumer the
01:40:25.480 whiskey guys what is old mon is it's rum
01:40:27.599 it's R yeah I read some research around
01:40:31.400 whoever attempted rum in India could not
01:40:33.880 beat old monk is that true I think
01:40:36.119 celebration rum which is of di Jo now
01:40:38.639 out sells old monong quite a bit bakardi
01:40:40.679 dropped their price so much to compete
01:40:43.000 with old no but bakadi B is gold and
01:40:46.520 white is like you have to get up the
01:40:48.639 price ladder like say we had launched a
01:40:51.159 1965 rum so like Army defense is one of
01:40:55.080 the largest market we are the highest
01:40:56.440 pric rum we're selling higher than old
01:40:58.239 Mo the numbers we the largest selling
01:41:00.320 rum so it depends on the pricing and
01:41:04.400 product and premiumization because there
01:41:07.480 most important a huge population of in
01:41:09.920 the country that drinks rum whose
01:41:11.840 disposable income is going to keep
01:41:14.000 increasing I also feel that that's not a
01:41:16.080 category play like rum I don't think
01:41:17.719 anybody's drinking rum for it being rum
01:41:19.880 yeah I just think they're just drinking
01:41:21.360 it because it's a spirit which is super
01:41:23.400 easily available and it's it's like
01:41:25.199 there is no it's never had it's never
01:41:27.719 had like a Jin has had a moment like
01:41:30.719 like I'll tell you I believe you know
01:41:33.719 Brandy is 18 to 19% of the market it's
01:41:37.599 is only 11% Brandy is 19% yeah why is
01:41:40.960 that see I think Brandy
01:41:44.560 98% of the Brandy sells in South so IED
01:41:48.440 you have to give us one yeah you know I
01:41:50.080 researched it because we have a morphus
01:41:52.360 so that is the super premium Brandy and
01:41:55.440 we have 58% market share there is uh
01:41:58.599 Brandy what I realized is South in South
01:42:02.239 people are very
01:42:03.639 religious so if you see pondi and Kerala
01:42:07.400 are two states plus Tamil Nadu so one is
01:42:10.719 pondy at the
01:42:12.040 French uh connection and French are into
01:42:15.280 Brandy second if you uh see all the
01:42:18.400 shops liquor shops in the South earlier
01:42:21.400 like Kerala was called doctors uh this
01:42:24.679 um each shop like the Brandy was called
01:42:27.440 doctor's Brandy right so people used to
01:42:30.639 think think that they'll drink because
01:42:32.239 of Health purpose religious purpose
01:42:34.520 doctor K like in North India if you see
01:42:37.560 when when we were kids when it was very
01:42:39.719 cold our mothers used to like you know
01:42:41.760 rub Brandy on our hand so I think it's
01:42:44.560 just some kind of that else South India
01:42:47.840 it's like hot Etc but the Brandy Market
01:42:51.719 there is huge
01:42:54.320 okay Tamil Nadu 85% of the market is
01:42:56.599 Brandy yeah so the numbers Tamil Nadu
01:42:58.599 you have to you have to distill in the
01:43:00.199 state in order to sell that's that's and
01:43:02.080 you can't have you imported Stu or you
01:43:04.360 have to you have to distill in the state
01:43:06.000 s over there hard Market the numbers we
01:43:09.560 had was the market is 63% whiskey 22%
01:43:14.719 Brandy 12% drum
01:43:18.199 8% vka no four 4% is 4 4% vodka Jin
01:43:24.199 it'll be all of all of together 96%
01:43:27.239 Brown yeah oh my God is there a switch
01:43:29.880 happening between brown Spirit to White
01:43:31.920 in India yes vka has been the largest
01:43:33.800 growing category in The Last 5 Years
01:43:35.760 about 2% or whatever vka vka and Jin
01:43:39.960 would be about 4% so vodka now would be
01:43:42.520 about three three and a half still it's
01:43:44.560 a it's smaller compar from but imagine
01:43:48.719 globally 25% is vodka yeah but vodka and
01:43:52.320 the white are getting it's coming I I
01:43:55.840 feel it's a matter of it it it'll grow
01:43:58.040 it'll eat it'll eat into the whiskey
01:44:00.119 market like I'm I'm banking on that smof
01:44:03.679 100 years ago was marketed as white
01:44:05.360 whiskey and that's how they the campaign
01:44:08.159 was that lead you
01:44:09.400 be drink and drive with because
01:44:12.760 it in vka 80% of the market now has
01:44:16.400 become flavored watka yeah and that's I
01:44:18.840 think so where we've got like launched
01:44:20.880 about Apple vka is very tasty no body is
01:44:23.599 taken off like crazy when we did
01:44:26.000 research everybody kept reiterating
01:44:28.880 Flavor Flavor Flavor in beer in vodka in
01:44:32.239 Jin and rum and brand everything why is
01:44:36.239 that switch to flavor happening would
01:44:39.080 you want to have like a flavored whiskey
01:44:41.639 Tom I'll tell you say let's take the
01:44:43.719 white Spirits mostly it's prevalent in
01:44:45.920 white Spirits not in the whiskey whiskey
01:44:48.239 you only have fire and honey and all
01:44:50.080 those but that is too small in vodka if
01:44:52.719 you see who are your consumers is the
01:44:55.320 younger generation and women now when
01:44:58.360 you see when a youngster is getting into
01:45:00.440 the drinking age
01:45:02.119 bracket alcohol by choice is bitter a
01:45:06.239 Pepsi or a Coke would taste much uh
01:45:09.719 better so they need a sweetish
01:45:13.280 flavor so they they tend to get for the
01:45:16.000 flavored uh this thing and then it's
01:45:18.040 easier to drink like the flavor Just Add
01:45:19.760 Water yeah I think there's there's also
01:45:22.239 another it does not smell it does not
01:45:24.480 smell which is yeah so what happen it's
01:45:26.400 like day drinking the exactly the Indian
01:45:29.719 consumer one of the craziest you would
01:45:32.280 assume that smof when they came to India
01:45:34.119 in 2007 and they were just doing parties
01:45:36.239 and they realized it's not taking off
01:45:38.560 but vodka in in terms of percentage of
01:45:41.960 you know market share to other Spirits
01:45:44.040 probably highest in the most
01:45:45.119 conservative State like Kashmir rajastan
01:45:47.639 and then you look at it you realize the
01:45:49.280 Nuance where it's being drunk a lot by
01:45:52.080 shopkeepers people who are working
01:45:53.880 during the day who have a Tabo to mask
01:45:56.760 their smell so you know you would find
01:45:58.040 that uh it's it's like some Fanta bottle
01:46:00.960 dying in that SAR shop and somebody's
01:46:02.800 sipping on it through the day he
01:46:04.800 probably drinking
01:46:06.280 some flavored flavored product so the
01:46:09.560 cool kids moved to Jin because there was
01:46:12.800 a
01:46:14.800 Botanical and the mes movical play what
01:46:17.960 does that mean see that is the herbs
01:46:19.880 like you the infusions like how like I
01:46:23.199 said Jin is nothing but a vodka with
01:46:25.320 flavor but the flavors were stuff like
01:46:27.960 you have to have Juniper then you would
01:46:29.320 have cinnamon J is the prime herb for
01:46:32.800 any gin call it but then you have addons
01:46:35.639 like you can have a gin of 11 Botanicals
01:46:38.159 18
01:46:39.480 Botanical have green apple gin right you
01:46:42.560 won't have a green apple gin but you
01:46:43.840 have a green apple vodka which has a
01:46:45.920 bigger Market size why fruit vodka
01:46:48.280 flower
01:46:49.280 Jin why why why is the flavor that you
01:46:52.920 choose to add to vodka a fruit whereas
01:46:56.840 it can be anything cinnamon it can be
01:46:59.199 coffee also but the most popular like we
01:47:01.880 started the flavor uh uh Trend in India
01:47:05.360 so green apple is the most famous then
01:47:07.639 is orange and then is cranber but it has
01:47:09.560 to be a Masia flavor yeah green apple is
01:47:12.480 the you can't you can't have a
01:47:14.239 nutmeg uh you can't have a nutmeg vodka
01:47:17.040 but you'll have a nutmeg infused gin
01:47:20.440 like he's talking about matcha beer yeah
01:47:23.119 that's as nuanced as nuanced gets right
01:47:26.119 but but that'll be part of his 25% share
01:47:29.560 it's a so it's it's it's a part of like
01:47:31.760 a portfolio where you also have a small
01:47:34.000 consumer so there's this whole consumer
01:47:36.199 who also relates to almost like
01:47:37.880 everything that's very high quality and
01:47:40.560 that consumer is see is on a completely
01:47:42.560 different Journey you can have a cafe R
01:47:44.920 yeah which will be very this thing but
01:47:47.080 for me for his brand these drops build
01:47:49.800 loyalty to the brand to the core
01:47:51.480 consumer now I like oh this guy's
01:47:53.400 actually played around with matcha I
01:47:54.840 must drink his other products I might
01:47:56.800 not be a regular consumer of the matcha
01:47:59.320 product but now in my head his
01:48:01.040 positioning my positioning has become so
01:48:03.199 we have zero marketing cost because we
01:48:04.719 keep doing products and every product
01:48:07.280 creates a little bit of its own buzz and
01:48:09.560 market and then it's like your product
01:48:11.000 mix you want to have like your base
01:48:13.719 playing you're playing at that level and
01:48:15.480 then you put one Coho diamond in the
01:48:17.520 middle and the COO Diamond gets you the
01:48:19.440 eyeballs and that and your actual base
01:48:22.360 level will actually benefit from it
01:48:24.239 because the main brand might or might
01:48:26.320 not s might not are becoming smaller
01:48:29.960 Juniper bombs Cricket they aged a gin
01:48:33.560 with used cricket bats which they Source
01:48:35.960 from all over the country yeah yeah okay
01:48:38.199 so you said go after the premiumize
01:48:42.800 audience which has upgraded from KF to a
01:48:45.280 Heineken and hit them at that price
01:48:48.599 point you said build something which is
01:48:51.599 India's bourbon
01:48:53.520 at answer to Bourbon yeah at 1200 to,
01:48:56.000 1400 rupees a bottle I said
01:48:58.920 Bangalore you said the story The Design
01:49:02.239 the packaging will have a big part to
01:49:04.000 play and a good go-to Market strategy is
01:49:07.599 physically stepping out meeting bar
01:49:09.440 owners consumers converting them
01:49:12.000 oneon-one and hoping for Word of Mouth
01:49:14.599 you said Brandy I said ram ram ram and
01:49:17.880 tunix and rtds radio drink beverages at
01:49:20.960 that's about five to seven years from
01:49:23.080 now but I I see that picking up why
01:49:25.880 don't I think space is going to be a
01:49:28.520 constraint people will not have too many
01:49:30.639 bars they won't have space in their
01:49:32.560 houses and they will not have space to
01:49:34.320 build a bar they would not have the
01:49:35.599 energy to buy a mixer have ice order
01:49:38.599 they would want the way they have a beer
01:49:40.599 they'll be ready to drink beverages
01:49:42.480 which will be there in the fridge
01:49:43.880 they'll just come back from work they'll
01:49:45.560 either have an option of a great beer or
01:49:47.400 something which is premixed open it
01:49:49.000 drink it and go and chuch you also said
01:49:51.520 price point same as
01:49:54.000 that the premium to an old monk the
01:49:55.960 first Stepping Stone from an old monk at
01:49:58.080 that price point your
01:49:59.800 turn they all suggested what should be
01:50:02.239 built which category price point what
01:50:04.800 kind of alcohol for somebody new
01:50:06.360 starting to build so if it is a matter
01:50:08.000 of selling you should create something
01:50:09.400 Innovative mhm there are lot of
01:50:11.840 opportunities which I'll just I won't go
01:50:14.760 on specific because we are going to get
01:50:16.560 into that what are you getting into next
01:50:18.679 answer I'll tell you but question in a
01:50:20.520 different right now A friend told about
01:50:23.040 ra what is it it is French origin yeah
01:50:26.760 there is a lot of Heritage there is a
01:50:29.080 lot of strength on the indianess we have
01:50:32.520 to see what India 100 years back offered
01:50:36.599 we have to get into the roots of India
01:50:38.800 yeah we have to see you told me this
01:50:40.599 already at your house we so I've been
01:50:42.239 working for four years on that we have
01:50:44.280 to get something which no one has seen
01:50:47.320 absolutely like if you see all my brand
01:50:49.280 history starting from a rampur royal
01:50:51.239 ranor Jess May everything is Indian so
01:50:54.360 here also the Indian ethnic things there
01:50:57.360 is so much of scope even for India and
01:51:00.440 that you can price it higher so the
01:51:03.040 minute you price it higher your margins
01:51:04.719 are there for any
01:51:06.560 newcomer uh you have to your uh gross
01:51:10.480 profit has to be high it has to be 70 to
01:51:13.920 80% else you'll fail if you try to
01:51:16.719 compete with the masses big boys will
01:51:19.239 take you over yeah so
01:51:21.560 the you cannot compete with them on
01:51:23.719 their muscle P I've competed I competed
01:51:26.520 but that was a different story but for a
01:51:28.760 young entrepreneur your Innovation and
01:51:31.440 price point and the margins has to be
01:51:33.880 attracted second would be don't don't
01:51:37.440 dump just look at the teries so one is I
01:51:41.280 will say ethnic flavors Ram I agree with
01:51:44.280 her which we are also venturing we
01:51:46.400 venturing into a $50 Ram coinu Reserve
01:51:50.560 first time it is a small small batch
01:51:53.480 distillation the it's made out of can
01:51:56.000 juice from North India only in the
01:51:57.840 winter season then matured in American
01:52:00.199 bourbon cast then uh kyak EXO cast then
01:52:03.599 vermo so it took us four years to create
01:52:05.520 that so it's a different Innovation so I
01:52:08.360 think Ram there iscope plus I think uh
01:52:12.880 the
01:52:13.800 ethnic the Indian story that too many Li
01:52:17.360 which was here which can take the right
01:52:20.400 take the world and India but the price
01:52:22.880 point should be high so the margins are
01:52:25.599 there makes sense so the Heritage lure
01:52:28.520 part has another Nuance to it which if
01:52:31.199 you can even look at say um mahua being
01:52:35.800 done by certain tribal communities you
01:52:37.679 travel to the Northeast you have a lot
01:52:39.719 of wild rice ferment still being done in
01:52:42.040 Manipur with indigenous varieties very
01:52:45.280 similar to what the Koreans do with
01:52:47.079 maguli and with the some like similar to
01:52:49.960 the nigori S too so there's so much to
01:52:52.800 do but you have to be little bit of like
01:52:55.040 you know research and find a lot of
01:52:57.800 there is also lot of ingredients which
01:52:59.760 are very unique to India and that's your
01:53:02.199 very strong mode if you can find the
01:53:04.000 indigenous varieties and then go local
01:53:07.480 local local local think Global act local
01:53:10.719 like what he earlier said like for me 28
01:53:13.480 states are 28 different countries if you
01:53:16.480 go to a Kerala your marketing strategy
01:53:18.159 has to be different Karnataka it has to
01:53:20.199 be different Punjab it has to be
01:53:22.119 different
01:53:23.040 you have to go on the regional festivals
01:53:24.920 and don't make a plan for 30 countries
01:53:26.520 conquer one at a time just one work and
01:53:28.480 work with smaller like even if you're
01:53:30.079 working with the bar Community work with
01:53:31.360 lesser amount of bars work with the best
01:53:33.000 bars but work with them very closely
01:53:35.239 versus just going and distributing to
01:53:37.520 all the bars in the country it depends
01:53:40.360 on point would be that the Manpower has
01:53:42.880 to
01:53:43.760 be talk
01:53:45.719 about who know
01:53:47.920 Li think think we are like PS apart the
01:53:52.000 way we think but I think in her industry
01:53:54.440 bar I think is one of the most virgin
01:53:57.560 opportunities in India we have not
01:53:58.960 started yeah if someone can clicket
01:54:01.159 click it like if you see
01:54:03.320 namos what their revenue and Etc is it's
01:54:07.719 up it's unreal they would make it 250es
01:54:11.079 400 they sold profit only wow namos the
01:54:16.360 zumas I think India has just started if
01:54:19.480 someone can create a name where you can
01:54:21.880 go I think there's a huge opportunity
01:54:24.360 that people are ready to pay money
01:54:28.880 [Music]
01:54:57.030 [Music]
01:55:08.520 one
01:55:10.000 thing after we have decided what to
01:55:12.719 build the next logical question is
01:55:16.320 distribution uh she spoke about going to
01:55:18.800 bars and selling by giving them taste of
01:55:22.639 talking to them
01:55:23.880 individually what are the ideas for a
01:55:26.440 young person starting off in
01:55:27.880 distribution how does one get
01:55:31.800 it did I go yeah see like I'll I'll talk
01:55:36.480 from the global context and then I'll
01:55:38.119 come to the Indian context like globally
01:55:41.199 I wanted to make like what we have done
01:55:42.719 in rampur
01:55:44.119 Jessel so we export to 100 countries now
01:55:48.560 it's always better to see and never
01:55:50.320 reinvent the wheel so we've been country
01:55:53.480 partners with enj Gallow they have been
01:55:55.360 the largest uh wineries in California
01:55:57.679 and the world them uh and uh what I saw
01:56:01.840 about the distribution model that they
01:56:03.960 have the best Distributors around the
01:56:06.280 globe even if they have to pay extra but
01:56:08.920 they have the distribution guys who are
01:56:12.000 passionate so globally we also followed
01:56:15.239 the same philosophy where we had
01:56:17.920 Distributors so we didn't have to invest
01:56:20.040 in Manpower in a country and get to the
01:56:22.599 nuances maybe you pay extra but you have
01:56:24.920 the right guy who can sell for you so
01:56:28.360 that was a good and an easier model but
01:56:30.599 can you do that only at scale or even if
01:56:32.400 you're really small when small I started
01:56:36.079 with zero like in rampur but like the
01:56:37.760 guy suppose my us distributor he left a
01:56:41.239 job with one of the largest uh uh
01:56:44.159 companies in America Distribution
01:56:45.960 Company and wanted to take India to the
01:56:48.079 world so started with negligible volume
01:56:52.360 now he's like minting money M and uh in
01:56:56.760 last seven years what he's done is
01:56:58.960 fantastic same thing in Ghana same thing
01:57:01.320 in Nigeria so a lot of places we have
01:57:03.719 done that Singapore a lot of places so
01:57:06.440 India I feel distribution is the most
01:57:09.400 expensive so depending on the state if
01:57:11.880 you get the right distribution partner
01:57:13.880 you get the right social and you address
01:57:17.159 the in a in a state suppose if you are
01:57:19.960 there you address the 10 indest bar so
01:57:23.599 the minute you are there other bars will
01:57:26.040 copy you they'll say that if you give
01:57:28.639 like if you have an entry to one on
01:57:30.360 promise like say a side car in Delhi if
01:57:33.239 anyone knows that okay if in side car
01:57:35.040 your brand is there it is accepted
01:57:37.880 automatically so I think you have to
01:57:39.880 catch the overall there do liquor Brands
01:57:42.800 give you free bees to display the
01:57:44.800 alcohol yeah absolutely I mean they give
01:57:47.199 you not just for display they give you
01:57:49.119 for Activation they give you for for
01:57:51.960 they they actually very very important
01:57:53.840 partners for you so like we are part of
01:57:56.000 the same ecosystem right if I don't buy
01:57:58.040 the Rand and sell it further then we are
01:58:00.199 nobody's benefiting from it so I have to
01:58:02.159 work together like almost like a
01:58:03.800 partnership uh they do end up taking uh
01:58:07.520 shelf space share of throat which
01:58:09.840 basically means that how much are you
01:58:11.760 pouring which are the which are say for
01:58:14.000 example I have a menu of 20 cocktails
01:58:16.840 out of which if I'm getting a majority
01:58:18.880 of say a tie up money it's called a tie
01:58:21.000 up money which basically means if I'm
01:58:22.599 working with a diu or a perno or a
01:58:24.440 bakari or even a radico I will be then
01:58:28.079 prioritizing their brand over other
01:58:30.159 brands to actually make cocktails with
01:58:32.239 which basically immediately turns into
01:58:33.719 volumes for them but it also gives them
01:58:35.599 visibility it also gives them activation
01:58:37.480 points touch points consumer feedback a
01:58:39.639 lot of things happen so it's a tool so
01:58:41.840 menu is a tool for you so if I start my
01:58:44.880 Bengaluru uh bourbon company and sell it
01:58:47.560 for 1,400 bucks and come to you would
01:58:50.400 you put me on your shelf because already
01:58:52.440 have a deal with your partners I will
01:58:54.079 put you on the Shelf I will not
01:58:55.520 immediately start pouring your your
01:58:57.760 brand pouring and and putting it on
01:58:59.880 shelf are two different things I have
01:59:02.079 almost to the tune of 350 listed uh
01:59:07.280 available visible brands in the menu so
01:59:09.880 let's say for example you're selling a
01:59:11.239 Dio brand what do they give you exactly
01:59:13.560 so they give me multiple see they they
01:59:15.800 support me for New Year and say
01:59:17.639 Christmas activation they support me for
01:59:19.719 so next month we are supporting an
01:59:21.480 entire month of pride month at the bar
01:59:23.880 so we celebrate it every year uh for
01:59:26.000 that I need to make a special menu with
01:59:27.560 that menu I need to make special drinks
01:59:29.119 which are you know uh which are actually
01:59:31.159 talking to the audience that I want
01:59:33.480 right at the bar I'm also doing like
01:59:35.679 some an event which is a talking
01:59:37.599 conversation sort of sit down which we
01:59:39.679 do every year then we end it with a big
01:59:42.159 party with a big band I need money for
01:59:44.639 all of these things if I bring like a
01:59:46.480 band band takes money if I bring a
01:59:48.239 photographer photographer will take
01:59:49.599 money so I'm taking money for this a
01:59:52.040 brand I'm not mentioning whichever brand
01:59:53.960 it is then I take money from them and
01:59:56.040 then for full month I'm actually giving
01:59:57.880 them the menu exclusivity for that
01:59:59.800 special month so you kind of it works
02:00:02.119 really well for your beverage cost point
02:00:04.000 of view so you actually can make money
02:00:06.079 by selling the brands and then the
02:00:07.360 brands are also happy because they're
02:00:08.639 getting multiple visibility points are
02:00:12.440 you demographically seeing any changes
02:00:15.079 in liquor consumption traditionally men
02:00:18.840 have been the one to buy and consume
02:00:21.079 liquor I don't know about consumption
02:00:23.199 because buying number is there are you
02:00:25.360 seeing more women consume alcohol is the
02:00:28.840 age at which somebody first consumes
02:00:32.599 changing uh there is research to show
02:00:36.000 that genz in America is consuming lesser
02:00:39.320 alcohol than
02:00:40.679 Millennials uh this problem is so Stark
02:00:43.719 in countries like Japan where young
02:00:45.520 people are not
02:00:47.159 drinking that the Japanese government is
02:00:49.520 starting sake
02:00:50.920 festivals different ways to encourage
02:00:53.880 young people to drink same problem in
02:00:55.880 India not at all I think women are
02:00:58.400 definitely drinking more there is no
02:00:59.760 doubt about that like that is a big plus
02:01:01.840 for us for the growth also so because U
02:01:04.800 the fact that there are many many women
02:01:06.719 joining into the drinking occasions
02:01:10.199 multiple Market is going because of the
02:01:11.719 women also also so women and also LDA
02:01:14.760 plus so we talking always whenever we
02:01:16.400 talk about legal drinking agent plus
02:01:18.840 they are also drinking better places
02:01:22.119 better quality premiumization all of
02:01:24.079 those things right so that is definitely
02:01:26.040 happening uh and they are actually
02:01:27.719 adding a huge huge value to to the
02:01:30.480 entire night also I think the the the
02:01:32.560 shopping experience overall especially
02:01:34.800 in Delhi retail Bombay
02:01:37.079 retail that is one of the what he said
02:01:39.520 is one of the most important we've been
02:01:41.159 advocating as radico and as the liquor
02:01:43.560 industry that earlier if you would have
02:01:45.880 gone into any shop in a Arana Mumbai
02:01:49.520 women can't go and Shop they'll be
02:01:51.280 looked down you know they'll not feel
02:01:52.920 safe but today if you see the shopping
02:01:55.360 experience whether it's Bangalore
02:01:57.520 whether it is G you have 20,000 ft it's
02:02:01.000 become very nice so women are
02:02:02.960 comfortable to go and pick up their
02:02:05.760 bottle second even when you go for a
02:02:08.199 party earlier like you know they used to
02:02:10.400 hide their glass but today it's like
02:02:12.119 normal for the new generation in fact a
02:02:15.239 women not drinking what it will feel
02:02:17.040 that why is she not
02:02:18.520 having
02:02:20.599 premiumization before before we get into
02:02:22.639 that subject properly because it seems
02:02:24.480 to be working across the category any
02:02:26.840 other distribution hacks I think one I
02:02:29.239 wanted to mention which um I think if
02:02:32.280 you are a absolute zero to one person
02:02:34.679 starting out I would say once you
02:02:36.360 identified what product you are doing
02:02:38.639 just take a few bottles and in there are
02:02:41.400 three layers to distribution what you
02:02:43.320 manufacture is called as the primary
02:02:46.280 then you what your distributor supplies
02:02:48.400 to the market to say Mini's bar is
02:02:50.719 called secondary and what minakshi sells
02:02:53.079 from her bar is called tertiary I would
02:02:56.079 suggest first thing that you do once you
02:02:58.560 have the product go Ulta don't go the
02:03:01.880 route that the big companies do where
02:03:03.599 you go do primary you have established
02:03:05.840 Distributors you go to 100 bars go to 25
02:03:09.280 30 wine shops take your product sample
02:03:11.599 talk to the owner you already built
02:03:13.760 enough Awareness on your brand on and
02:03:16.440 people know that you are doing so that
02:03:18.560 when you go to a distributor you know
02:03:20.679 that if you sell 100 200 cases it's
02:03:22.599 going to go to those mini bars the
02:03:24.000 Distributors is going to be far more
02:03:25.360 comfortable taking on your product if
02:03:27.960 you've already done that little leg work
02:03:29.800 so I think that's one of the simplest
02:03:31.360 things that I think anyone like you said
02:03:33.320 going from zero to one the hardest thing
02:03:35.639 for a new be is to find a distributor
02:03:38.599 it's not as easy as you think it is a
02:03:40.360 lot of people don't want to take your
02:03:41.679 brand yeah you have to show them show
02:03:44.320 them basum they will be
02:03:48.400 like minaki vouches for a brand
02:03:52.760 listing in a bar you know any a
02:03:55.480 depletion is the biggest problem you'll
02:03:56.960 get listing at Mini's bar but the bottle
02:03:58.920 will be lying how do you deplete
02:04:00.800 it so it has to be combination of and
02:04:03.480 secondly how do you get it listed on the
02:04:05.040 menu it's at the bar but when I open the
02:04:07.239 menu it's not there I have to convince
02:04:09.159 minaki that I will spend money I will
02:04:11.000 give you a band I'll give you a DJ but
02:04:13.079 please get my put my alcohol inside one
02:04:15.960 of your
02:04:16.760 cocktails what if you give minaki the
02:04:19.119 alcohol and say pay me after yourself
02:04:21.119 that doesn't matter that would't work in
02:04:23.559 in the end ter has to happen as it is as
02:04:26.280 it is the credit period is high so for a
02:04:28.920 newcomer consumer has to pick it up like
02:04:30.840 if consumer is not picking it up then
02:04:32.679 there is or she puts inside a cocktail
02:04:34.599 which I Market which gets sold further
02:04:37.239 my alcohol is getting depleted so a
02:04:40.480 bartender a route very popular on
02:04:43.719 bartenders and counter salesman we call
02:04:45.880 them
02:04:46.840 CSM so there is a guy who's a manager at
02:04:49.719 a say a madula in Bangalore and that guy
02:04:53.840 knows everything about what brand sells
02:04:56.199 he any customer who is a regular who
02:04:59.520 will go to that wine shop or to a duers
02:05:02.119 or whatever will ask the person and
02:05:04.199 he'll say this is new and it's doing
02:05:06.800 well I have tried it so create that
02:05:09.000 recommendation from people who are
02:05:10.920 already in the business and people trust
02:05:13.119 you don't have trust but the person who
02:05:15.760 standing there day in day out for years
02:05:17.760 has a far more trust and he will
02:05:19.639 recommend your product only if that
02:05:21.040 person likes
02:05:22.199 so make that effort first so bartenders
02:05:24.159 are bartenders everyone bartenders every
02:05:27.239 brand wants them Plus for example in the
02:05:29.679 in the beer industry when I was running
02:05:31.400 Jade uh I remember this so clearly uh
02:05:34.599 people would pay the bartender outside
02:05:36.960 of their job you return caps to me I'll
02:05:40.199 give you I'll give you 20 rupees a cap
02:05:42.520 for depletion to make my distributor
02:05:45.239 happy so he sells my product so I'm
02:05:47.040 burning money so that the bartenders are
02:05:49.159 pushing my beer in the restaurant to
02:05:51.199 customers so they have to have you have
02:05:52.800 to have these innovative ways of
02:05:54.599 marketing how to deplete your product in
02:05:56.199 a restaurant so I think at every level
02:05:58.320 your intervention will change yeah so
02:06:00.320 when the founder is talking then you
02:06:01.840 should talk to the founders of the bar
02:06:03.920 and then sometimes if your sales team is
02:06:05.599 talking the sales team can talk to the
02:06:07.040 bartenders vice versa I mean now it's
02:06:09.000 obviously the the lines are blurring as
02:06:10.880 well so when you are talking to the
02:06:12.360 bartender of course I mean you are
02:06:13.760 selling the same product but at the end
02:06:16.079 of it they you have to see what is the
02:06:17.880 bartender benefiting where is the you
02:06:20.079 can't just say it's the best whiskey in
02:06:21.400 the world and I have made a BBA which
02:06:23.239 can you can you should just do it he's
02:06:25.040 not the decision maker right they are
02:06:26.639 never the decision makers they are the
02:06:28.440 ones who are actually going to be the
02:06:30.360 ones who can be Advocates of the brand
02:06:31.960 they can talk about the brand you give
02:06:33.280 them the brand experience you give them
02:06:34.880 if you have a Distillery call them which
02:06:36.760 is now happening in India a lot a lot of
02:06:39.119 the Indian makers are calling bartenders
02:06:41.199 bar owners to to their Source right and
02:06:44.400 actually explaining them the whole
02:06:45.880 process of say Brewing the brand
02:06:47.679 creating the brand and then they become
02:06:49.199 part of the story then it's the same
02:06:51.000 thing right you experiencing the brand
02:06:52.400 from day one and then you actually have
02:06:54.079 a personal connect with that brand there
02:06:56.440 multiple touch points and every touch
02:06:58.360 point if you're a new brand you have to
02:07:00.199 disrupt and physically you have to go
02:07:02.239 talk toally
02:07:04.280 or and every person who's your
02:07:06.599 stakeholder is the hero of his own
02:07:08.440 Journey so you think that if a counter
02:07:10.599 salesman's journey is very different
02:07:12.320 from a retail shop owners to a
02:07:14.480 bartenders to everything relate to that
02:07:17.079 understand how your product can make
02:07:18.639 their lives better whatever way it may
02:07:20.480 be and that's the only only connect that
02:07:22.239 you have nothing else Works money is if
02:07:25.520 you are going to compete with money then
02:07:27.079 you are already out of the game because
02:07:28.480 you're competing with people who have
02:07:29.719 like1 $200 billion dollar you know you
02:07:32.400 have to do something all the biggest
02:07:34.000 Indian industry is run by multinationals
02:07:36.760 do you think sponsoring events works you
02:07:39.239 can take this yeah so yeah it does I
02:07:41.639 think these are all opportunities for
02:07:43.880 Brands to Showcase their brand out of
02:07:46.079 the bottle so for example in a g
02:07:47.599 Explorers Club uh there are two parts of
02:07:49.960 it uh legally uh event alcohol brands in
02:07:53.679 India they cannot do their own events
02:07:56.040 they can do their own events but they
02:07:57.239 cannot Market the content legally online
02:08:00.840 post doing an event so when these IPS of
02:08:03.440 cocktail festivals come up that's where
02:08:05.320 all these Brands come participate
02:08:07.119 content is created uh you get uh at a
02:08:11.040 very low cost you get high footfall uh
02:08:13.599 you get people intrigued into your brand
02:08:15.679 because of how you've decked up your bar
02:08:17.239 and the and the engagements that you
02:08:18.840 have on your bar and post that you've
02:08:21.119 not technically done your own event you
02:08:23.520 come create content there which you can
02:08:24.840 further amplify online that's where you
02:08:26.880 can call your influencers you can have
02:08:29.000 also it works better sponsorships also
02:08:31.639 work far better is because you are
02:08:33.040 actually experiencing the brand versus
02:08:35.440 just seeing it on TV for example you
02:08:37.000 were to see an ad on TV of XY Z whiskey
02:08:40.119 and Jin you'll see it you know Shah ruk
02:08:42.480 Khan is selling it as the best amazing
02:08:44.360 brand that's it that's the end of it
02:08:46.840 right you sample it too
02:08:49.119 I I mean with the surrogate you see it
02:08:51.760 but at the end of it now today it's the
02:08:54.800 where that is where I feel the quality
02:08:56.840 of conversation has shifted where you'll
02:08:58.920 be like if I see grow brewing companies
02:09:01.800 say you know I whatever whichever
02:09:04.320 people's be I see an ad versus if I
02:09:06.719 actually get an experience of a I go to
02:09:09.360 a music festival I get to try the beer I
02:09:12.360 get to speak to the maybe the founder
02:09:14.400 not the founder whoever con the whole
02:09:17.320 experience is the product right so I
02:09:19.480 feel it's such a sensorial experience
02:09:21.119 just like food no no matter how many
02:09:22.960 advertisements you can put on TV or
02:09:25.719 newspapers and magazines this I would
02:09:27.960 like to say like what uh shuch read he's
02:09:31.320 created a niche like the GC created was
02:09:34.880 Jinn Jinn was exploding in India so what
02:09:38.119 happened like say my Jessel we start we
02:09:40.800 did it there the launch we're waiting
02:09:42.159 for a GC actually delete the launch to
02:09:44.639 participate so what happened GC all the
02:09:47.400 Gin lovers were as I said to make the
02:09:50.320 first 10 th000 consumer is the toughest
02:09:52.840 loyalist then you become 50 then you
02:09:54.920 become Millions so in GC it was just an
02:09:58.360 evolution but all the Gin lovers because
02:10:00.960 he had only Jin were coming there which
02:10:03.480 he coupled like a carnival that is your
02:10:06.400 music and everything one is a function
02:10:09.159 it that alcohol is
02:10:10.800 there he branded that so for that a
02:10:13.920 brand to come there and actually the Gin
02:10:16.599 lovers coming there it makes a lot of
02:10:18.520 difference and also splits the cost of
02:10:20.199 multiple Brands like if total cost is to
02:10:22.280 do to do this event is four crores is
02:10:24.520 getting split between 15 Brands versus
02:10:26.440 then them creating their IP of their own
02:10:29.000 but I think there is a there's a so a
02:10:32.199 brand is like a person and you have to
02:10:35.079 be really understand what's the brand
02:10:37.119 personality before you think about
02:10:39.159 events I think when you one of the
02:10:41.559 easiest things is what you are not going
02:10:43.199 to do if you're clear about your brand
02:10:45.079 then venturing into events the great SP
02:10:47.159 so like we were very clear that we are
02:10:49.119 not going to do any collectivist activ
02:10:51.639 we are not going to do football
02:10:53.520 screenings or anything that's General
02:10:55.199 Trope in Bria because we as a brand are
02:10:58.480 focused on you know sustainability you
02:11:01.840 know making sure that you know we are
02:11:03.360 probably like focusing on cre so we only
02:11:06.199 focus on sponsoring events which are
02:11:08.360 like marathons which are like cycling
02:11:10.400 events which are Outdoors so you know
02:11:12.400 what happens is you also then when you
02:11:14.000 own one category and you're focusing
02:11:16.320 entirely on it you become far more your
02:11:19.880 your entire you know digital spread is
02:11:23.159 only going to be messaging that is very
02:11:25.280 at sublinear level which is going to
02:11:27.199 come they're saying that okay this beer
02:11:28.639 is only drunk or seen around these kind
02:11:31.960 of people identify that you know there
02:11:34.880 are thousands of events you don't have
02:11:36.880 that much dry powder you have to choose
02:11:39.079 where you're going to go so you're
02:11:40.199 saying don't go too broad pick what is
02:11:42.480 your brand value stry you have to have a
02:11:44.679 plan I mean you second year third and if
02:11:47.440 you can pick one category and go to it
02:11:49.520 till the end and become like someone
02:11:51.599 which is becomes a brand for cyclist or
02:11:53.639 a brand
02:11:56.520 Ford whatever it is then you are like
02:11:59.280 example if you go to IPL you won't be
02:12:02.280 visible like you spend because we don't
02:12:05.920 have VC funders and the startup fund
02:12:09.000 like not startup but like you know the
02:12:10.559 big boys so you'll be lost it's all the
02:12:13.639 dots Etc who are sponsoring there so IPL
02:12:16.960 if you sponsor you have to have a budget
02:12:18.239 of 100 CR so in our language when
02:12:19.840 someone comes to me and tells me we want
02:12:21.440 to launch a brand or we want to activate
02:12:23.159 the brand we create something called a
02:12:25.199 1990 right one is your big launch where
02:12:28.280 you'll spend maybe 50% or maybe 25% of
02:12:31.639 your budget which will be a Delhi or a
02:12:33.599 Bombay then in the nine where 50% of
02:12:36.639 your budget will go would be in your
02:12:39.000 major metros which will be Delhi Bombay
02:12:40.880 Bangalore where you'll Target about 50
02:12:43.800 bars each where rest budget will go then
02:12:46.040 you'll create a 90 90 will be a small
02:12:48.800 activation which could be a drink serve
02:12:51.599 or a glass wear or a a tower which will
02:12:54.840 go across majority Outlets across every
02:12:57.880 city in in whichever cities that you
02:12:59.920 want to activate so that's how you have
02:13:01.520 to split your marketing budget you
02:13:02.800 cannot only uh do one launch and uh
02:13:05.760 extinguish your marketing budget that
02:13:07.719 happens we've seen many many you have to
02:13:09.360 go consistent you have to go your
02:13:11.199 marketing re Mumbai is the most Mumbai
02:13:15.400 is the costliest to convert any City
02:13:19.520 like if he wants to launch his from
02:13:22.079 Mumbai as a startup it's very tough the
02:13:25.400 kind of money it burns like you know it
02:13:27.880 like I I I address Mumbai the last you
02:13:30.920 always it's the most expensive Market am
02:13:34.320 I right yeah absolutely because High
02:13:36.320 entry barrier cost of K form which is
02:13:38.679 the government taxes you almost even
02:13:40.840 cost of Entry the Rost of Entry the
02:13:42.760 retail you know you need to Discount and
02:13:45.880 sponsor a certain set percentage when
02:13:48.119 you want to space is limited so the
02:13:50.119 retail stores are smaller so where would
02:13:53.040 I start my liquor brand Goa Goa which
02:13:55.920 brand you will first list in Goa by pay
02:13:58.119 50,000 Rupees BB you'll pay 50,000
02:14:00.360 Rupees as your listing fees to legally
02:14:02.840 sell your in Goa see bourbon as it is
02:14:05.840 suppose if you start you have to take
02:14:07.760 three years time then you come to good
02:14:10.800 and basically it's a 5e process from now
02:14:13.360 what if I buy old age no you can do you
02:14:15.960 can do the other model we don't we are
02:14:17.760 not distilling so we are also talking
02:14:19.239 about changing the model a little bit
02:14:21.199 right so we we can buy spirit and blend
02:14:24.360 it and age it and age it you have to AG
02:14:27.440 it find yeah we have to find a I feel
02:14:30.280 goai will be easier than any other
02:14:31.599 Market would be not yeah agent there
02:14:35.480 itself um pay 50,000 Rupees to the
02:14:38.280 government get listed there for one
02:14:40.320 product very
02:14:42.199 cheap get licenses first 120 180 would
02:14:46.880 be 12 lakh rupees oh whiskey is 25 lakh
02:14:49.360 rupees per SKU in Delhi
02:14:51.920 to get your product listed that's just
02:14:53.639 yeah that's just
02:14:54.760 listing who knows listing is for a for a
02:14:57.559 one to from a z to one why is the most
02:14:59.760 expensive in retail like say rampur here
02:15:01.840 is
02:15:02.559 125,000 in harana it is uh 7,000 Delhi
02:15:06.480 it is 8,000 MB is highest tax so 44
02:15:10.000 would be G 49 would be this is after
02:15:12.559 reduction for the last two
02:15:14.239 years reduction Mumbai is the highest
02:15:16.800 but this is after reduction rates so we
02:15:18.679 got this interesting stat
02:15:22.119 what percentage of a state's Revenue
02:15:25.119 comes from
02:15:26.599 alcohol the highest happens to be utar
02:15:29.520 Pradesh 22% and I we contribute 26% of
02:15:33.280 the states levenue wow that's crazy
02:15:36.360 Karnataka 20% 12,000 crores because
02:15:40.000 karnataka's taxation is mad it's like
02:15:42.040 80% tax is what you pay in in between
02:15:46.040 second is Tamil Nadu second is Karnataka
02:15:49.840 thirdd Tamil Nadu Bengal
02:15:51.679 B 20.2% percent percentage wise actually
02:15:56.079 sorry pondicherry is 40% that's
02:15:59.400 Distribution Hub it's not actually a
02:16:01.119 place where people then comes Punjab
02:16:03.520 utarak
02:16:05.679 Himachal uh
02:16:11.079 MP they're all 17 to 20% up is the
02:16:14.320 largest but this is crazy a state is
02:16:16.880 earning 20% of its Revenue not one but
02:16:19.520 so many and they make
02:16:21.520 why because because excise is the only
02:16:24.079 thing under State subject we've been
02:16:25.760 lobbing that why don't we come under
02:16:28.320 GST so for I don't get any input credit
02:16:32.478 don't we are the privileged ones the
02:16:34.879 minute if I come under GST my whole game
02:16:37.760 our balance sheet would look so
02:16:38.959 beautiful yeah can you make the case
02:16:41.318 like articulate because we'll make this
02:16:42.959 a real and put it out for whoever is
02:16:45.398 listening why should you move from state
02:16:47.519 to
02:16:48.318 GST see first of all any like suppose if
02:16:51.760 I'm transporting my material from Delhi
02:16:54.840 uh up to any other state I have
02:16:56.799 Interstate
02:16:58.080 duties then I do not have any input
02:17:00.718 credit on my raw material excise Duties
02:17:03.318 are different so if GST comes I'll be
02:17:06.318 like normal there'll be you
02:17:08.478 Manufacturing in up are the duties lower
02:17:10.558 than Goa no no I have to manufacture
02:17:12.318 every that's why I have 41 units that's
02:17:14.478 the biggest entry to barrier it's a big
02:17:17.439 cost uh cost uh not Logistics Duty yeah
02:17:22.799 also so it's it's it's it's absolutely
02:17:25.679 like I'm telling you it's like to
02:17:27.439 getting into liquor is so complicated
02:17:29.718 because of that so I have a question for
02:17:31.799 you long now this is then I I so let's
02:17:37.519 you know think about it that you know
02:17:39.240 you Al Alco is slower because let's say
02:17:42.959 if you were India's the biggest whiskey
02:17:45.799 Market but we have apart from like the
02:17:49.040 biggest guys like rad ketan or you know
02:17:52.478 peros or di of the world nobody's making
02:17:54.638 malt Spirit here one of the reasons is
02:17:56.638 if you start malt you have to mature it
02:17:59.040 for 8 years 12 years now I went the
02:18:01.359 whole route of with zero money starting
02:18:04.160 going to investors in
02:18:06.160 20178 just with an ice box when the
02:18:08.959 laptop was owned by pora so literally
02:18:12.080 most of the investors back in the day
02:18:13.718 were all Tech investors and they had
02:18:15.679 they were very new to Consumer and any
02:18:18.280 kind of open market money that's
02:18:20.040 available in India looks at that same
02:18:21.760 11e return that everyone has to give to
02:18:24.120 their LPS seven years s year yeah or
02:18:26.638 even shorter your term sheets are 5
02:18:28.439 years plus 5 plus two but you probably
02:18:30.638 give the money so how would you now
02:18:33.760 create this kind of if you were to you
02:18:36.920 you see this is a $300 million uh 300
02:18:40.000 million cases industry largely run by
02:18:42.080 whiskey with zero upgrade happening on
02:18:44.240 product essentially because there's no
02:18:46.799 Capital that can finance a business that
02:18:48.718 can have those many legs or the L of it
02:18:51.760 as a person who is from Finance what
02:18:54.679 would be the product that you would
02:18:56.318 probably create for this this category
02:18:59.120 in terms of funding if somebody would
02:19:00.599 come to you and say I would want to
02:19:02.359 build a mall disher and you know the
02:19:04.679 returns would come after 12 years how
02:19:07.080 would you look at it what would be that
02:19:09.280 good
02:19:10.160 question as a startup yeah as a startup
02:19:14.398 phenomenal product made in a small
02:19:17.040 lab I think we are a little bit of an
02:19:19.840 exception to that rule rule because we
02:19:21.359 are a Perpetual fund of sorts cuz we
02:19:24.120 don't allocate third party money and
02:19:26.840 it's mostly prop money we have really
02:19:29.959 long tenur the current thesis I have uh
02:19:34.718 thesis passion Fascination is to watch
02:19:39.439 Indian Brands kill it abroad uh so be it
02:19:42.679 with radico be it with subco be it with
02:19:46.398 Blu Stone be it ather
02:19:49.640 motorcycles these are all uh or 1111 The
02:19:53.359 Shirt Company uh these are all
02:19:56.439 Investments which are far from maturity
02:19:59.760 uh the question if they will ever mature
02:20:03.439 and turn profitable is also unknown but
02:20:06.920 my thesis today is to find the hero
02:20:09.880 product find places where the product is
02:20:12.760 solved for the rest of it will figure
02:20:15.560 out along the way I'm there right now
02:20:17.680 and I'm happy to take these bets uh
02:20:21.359 passionately take these bets and I have
02:20:23.040 a lot of fun with them nice yeah if I
02:20:25.600 like a product in a certain category the
02:20:28.840 marketing the sales The Narrative the
02:20:31.760 financials all of that come second if I
02:20:34.760 can find a product that can compete
02:20:36.920 internationally I'll do it absolutely
02:20:39.000 but what if a product is born after 5
02:20:40.840 years his question is that yeah
02:20:44.200 so already a person is there but one is
02:20:47.439 that a person comes I can taste the
02:20:49.720 product in 5 years you mean you get you
02:20:51.880 get the glimpse of it maybe of the no no
02:20:53.560 you'll only get the glimpse of the
02:20:55.120 packaging or whatever but or
02:20:57.080 directionally to maltt and everything
02:20:58.920 it'll take 5 six
02:21:00.399 years your first money your Revenue
02:21:04.600 exactly your Revenue after funding is 7
02:21:06.840 years let's say six years I I'll tell
02:21:08.399 you my biggest worry and I'm being
02:21:09.840 really honest here with
02:21:13.080 liquor I have to put it in a different
02:21:15.720 box as many of these other Investments
02:21:18.200 which might be an energy transition or
02:21:19.920 whatever cuz there I'm betting sector
02:21:22.960 thesis if I'm betting on a electric
02:21:25.640 vehicle which I will see in 5 years
02:21:28.760 broadly I'm sold to the idea that we'll
02:21:31.080 switch from fossil to renewable and we
02:21:33.479 will need the end point to be electric
02:21:35.760 to have efficiency in the value chain
02:21:37.800 right so if I find a good guy there it's
02:21:40.160 enough with liquor it's a little bit
02:21:42.640 more convoluted because I the data I'm
02:21:46.439 accessing today
02:21:48.120 is we we typically tend to mimic the
02:21:51.680 West in terms of consumption patterns in
02:21:54.479 India and the fact that the genzi are
02:21:57.560 drinking lesser than Millennials is
02:22:01.120 something which is of a worry to me so I
02:22:04.040 would need to buy into the sector truly
02:22:07.399 radico is an exception to me because
02:22:10.040 they have a
02:22:11.319 differentiated Indian first product
02:22:14.359 which is almost patriotic in nature and
02:22:17.000 I love the fact that people are fighting
02:22:19.040 over radical bottles in a beautyfree
02:22:21.640 versus a glen fidic or another brand
02:22:23.720 like that I love the idea of that I like
02:22:26.120 the names I like the taste uh these are
02:22:29.359 elements that appeal to me today but
02:22:32.040 otherwise liquor as a category I would
02:22:34.200 have to be sold and somebody probably
02:22:37.399 will come along the way and sell it I'm
02:22:39.280 I'm not taking the
02:22:41.319 moralistic debate
02:22:43.439 here uh something is legal it's legal
02:22:46.439 people should do it in moderation I'm a
02:22:48.439 capitalistic investor and I will not
02:22:50.960 fiend morality and altruism in a manner
02:22:53.920 that I don't have to and I don't believe
02:22:55.359 in doing it either uh if somebody smart
02:22:58.800 comes to me and says here is this new
02:23:01.920 alcohol it was it's not a imfl it's more
02:23:05.840 like made from I don't know like from
02:23:08.319 some lemong grass or some plant in India
02:23:11.319 and this has history and culture 500
02:23:14.040 years we will package it this way sell
02:23:16.359 it that way we will take it to Market
02:23:18.240 this way in 5 years from now I would
02:23:21.240 probably bite if he is convincing enough
02:23:25.240 but also 0 to one what I see in the
02:23:27.560 market is very few investors want to
02:23:30.560 back people in the alcohol space I had
02:23:33.960 to P to 80 people and they say alcohol
02:23:38.240 meat that's a first answer I'll tell you
02:23:40.920 we're starting this new fund it's not
02:23:42.800 actually a fund it is a grant it is
02:23:45.600 three times as big as Shark Tank we
02:23:48.359 don't in terms of the amount we give out
02:23:50.479 out we don't take any equity in the
02:23:53.319 businesses that we give these grants to
02:23:56.200 we just looking at young people nice
02:23:58.800 under the age of 25 great ideas no money
02:24:02.439 to execute and we are giving them money
02:24:04.720 through a segregation process not large
02:24:07.240 checks 20 lakhs 40 laks but to a lot of
02:24:10.479 people the end result is if it
02:24:13.640 inculcates entrepreneurship in the
02:24:15.760 country it's something that we're all
02:24:17.040 very passionate about and we're all
02:24:19.200 we're all in this ecosystem where we've
02:24:20.720 been so lucky by virtue of circumstance
02:24:23.840 over the last I don't know 15 20 years
02:24:27.439 uh it has more appeal to me than giving
02:24:29.960 that money to a charity what about
02:24:32.560 celebrity Le brands do you think it
02:24:35.000 works I know in fashion I'll give you an
02:24:38.640 example uh when I've looked at Fashion
02:24:43.080 cosmetic uh Brands led by
02:24:47.399 celebrities in India have not worked
02:24:50.399 globally have
02:24:51.720 worked there's some dichotomy there I
02:24:54.080 don't know why it is not working in
02:24:55.840 India what do you think will be the use
02:24:58.399 case for
02:25:01.479 alcohol so globally uh the people who
02:25:04.680 were building uh the people who were
02:25:06.520 building um alcohol Brands um in America
02:25:10.040 were celebrities and the following was
02:25:13.040 of a certain uh strata and of a certain
02:25:16.279 disposable income that would follow them
02:25:18.760 right so tomorrow if RVE Singh starts an
02:25:22.560 alcohol brand of a premium segment the
02:25:25.640 people will see through that right so
02:25:27.840 I'm not going to start drinking a
02:25:29.160 certain type of product because AR Singh
02:25:31.800 drinks
02:25:32.880 it who should start what which actor
02:25:35.319 should start what I think um Aran Khan
02:25:39.439 what he's doing I think he's doing a
02:25:41.000 good job the Dial Dial he's got a he's
02:25:44.359 got a vodka he's got a m now and he's
02:25:46.800 got a fashion brand I think Zena Aman
02:25:49.240 should do a wine
02:25:50.920 if at all you know I think it's very
02:25:52.560 interesting very interesting yeah you
02:25:54.439 know because see you know's built
02:25:58.120 Aviation how many of the people would
02:26:00.640 know her now no no regardless I'm saying
02:26:02.800 like you know if you
02:26:05.399 see celebrity endorsement or celebrity
02:26:08.160 doing a brand brand old brand does
02:26:10.720 endorsement work because I it's
02:26:13.000 basically putting talking about
02:26:15.920 celebrity definitely yes how about
02:26:18.160 celebrity marketed brand I'm sure you
02:26:20.000 use cele see I've got a lot of
02:26:22.040 experience with lot of we had a lot of
02:26:24.240 brand ambassadors did it work see what
02:26:27.920 happens now as a startup because I
02:26:30.279 started with kind of zero
02:26:32.120 money when I got engaged I didn't have
02:26:34.399 money to open a bottle of champagne that
02:26:35.920 time for my wife I was in
02:26:38.399 Kolkata so that kind we were like
02:26:41.680 stretched totally
02:26:43.680 stretched
02:26:45.439 so what I realized you take a
02:26:48.840 celebrity you buy buy a Mercedes you buy
02:26:51.319 a roll sty but you don't have petrol to
02:26:53.120 put in it so one is the celebrity the
02:26:55.800 film cost but the main thing is airing
02:26:58.200 and doing justice so one is you do
02:27:00.800 justice with it so you have if you take
02:27:02.279 a celebrity you have to do proper
02:27:04.200 Justice you have to spend enough money
02:27:07.240 nowadays celebrity also if you see a
02:27:09.160 movie to in especially now I'm talking
02:27:11.479 today's context a celebrity cost is huge
02:27:15.600 film making is huge then to air it so
02:27:17.960 you have to have a substantial budget
02:27:19.600 but it works with the budget what it
02:27:22.000 does it gets you immediate recall
02:27:24.960 depending on how you use the celebrity
02:27:27.520 but not sales no it'll help you for like
02:27:31.439 you the eyeball eyeballs it's like
02:27:33.359 getting a cricket so like what he said
02:27:35.920 with that the salesman has to be
02:27:37.840 motivated the bar guys have to be
02:27:39.680 motivated the pr should write about it
02:27:42.160 it has to be event should be there so it
02:27:44.240 has to be a 360° term so if you have a x
02:27:46.920 budget then you see where you have to
02:27:49.279 spend it because alcohol it's a dark
02:27:52.000 environment if
02:27:53.399 celebrity marketed brand we have all
02:27:56.319 agreed does not lead to sales but maybe
02:27:58.680 gives you visibility in brand recall
02:28:01.359 does product placement work how does
02:28:04.040 that work the bigger question I have
02:28:05.760 which I want to ask you like we've seen
02:28:07.439 in all the Ecom sites where they have
02:28:10.680 become like you know unicorns and
02:28:12.720 everything see
02:28:14.800 alcohol suppose money is for the private
02:28:18.760 equities no problem problem there's
02:28:20.800 enough Capital which is available now
02:28:22.960 suppose if you have a budget of 300 cres
02:28:25.399 and you say I want to start a brand and
02:28:28.000 in two years I go boom boom boom boom on
02:28:30.439 the TV media whatever dark environment I
02:28:33.720 have do you think will it
02:28:36.279 succeed in a Ecom it might succeed
02:28:38.800 because you buy customers you have were
02:28:40.720 called to action but
02:28:42.080 alcohol I think it's very tough yeah has
02:28:44.880 to build through taste it has to build
02:28:47.040 through generations it has to build
02:28:48.960 slowly what I believe in alcohol you
02:28:51.600 cannot push sales right you have to win
02:28:55.680 sales yeah yeah like as I said first
02:28:57.800 10,000 is important so even sometimes I
02:29:00.560 brew with that idea whether is it the
02:29:02.840 right strategy but in my last 20 to two
02:29:05.560 decades of my experience I feel it's
02:29:08.960 it's not worked but what ends up
02:29:11.000 happening is 0 to 100 happens when you
02:29:13.160 go into someone else's distribution
02:29:15.000 chain right but the minute you put in
02:29:17.040 300 crores you want that your sales
02:29:19.359 should happen then you dump the material
02:29:21.840 the or a or diio or a perno to get into
02:29:27.439 that distribution what ends up happening
02:29:29.040 is okay you want to take uh one uh case
02:29:32.520 of Johnny Walker you have to take six
02:29:34.240 bottles of this new brand which I've
02:29:36.240 launched so it's actually literally
02:29:37.479 pushed onto um
02:29:40.279 on so you say you buy this but I have
02:29:43.240 this brand which is not selling still
02:29:45.200 like Bott so then you'll be like I mean
02:29:48.040 this is this is fine let's take example
02:29:50.080 suppose if a guy comes a new guy I want
02:29:52.279 to take your bar shelf I want visibility
02:29:54.640 I'll pay you X lakhs okay you keep this
02:29:57.319 much bottle she'll keep it once but if
02:30:00.960 it does not go and it's a new brand
02:30:03.240 first of all why will anyone come and
02:30:04.720 take a new brand it has to be built
02:30:06.520 gradually am I right yeah it's very
02:30:09.080 difficult in alcohol it's very difficult
02:30:11.520 where you can just pump in monies and
02:30:13.920 consumers will come it's a very slow
02:30:15.880 process and also another very
02:30:17.279 interesting thing about India is before
02:30:19.160 you realize how your products doing you
02:30:22.120 can so what happens a lot of times when
02:30:24.279 you are you can grow by you start off
02:30:27.600 with say South Bombay and South Delhi
02:30:29.359 and Bangalore and in one year there is
02:30:32.000 always in India there is always a rush
02:30:33.640 to try a new product we are a large
02:30:35.279 country people want to try new things
02:30:37.040 because new things don't happen that
02:30:38.800 often so the consumer is drinking your
02:30:41.520 product in say the early City so you see
02:30:43.800 straction coming in but then you say
02:30:46.080 okay you know I'm going to get money
02:30:47.680 raise a large amount of money and I'm
02:30:49.319 going to go into newer markets so by the
02:30:51.720 time you go to tana and you going to the
02:30:53.600 suburbs and everything you're still
02:30:55.240 growing because you're doing primary
02:30:56.520 sales but your original core consumers
02:30:58.560 doesn't come back to you repeat this you
02:31:01.399 start going from Tana now to nask from
02:31:03.560 nask to ratlam it takes you five years
02:31:06.279 and you can still grow year on year but
02:31:08.600 you if you don't measure your sale at
02:31:11.640 Outlet level where you started your core
02:31:13.600 consumer stickiness and repeat then you
02:31:16.840 may show a growth story on the numbers
02:31:18.800 on the balance sheet but in reality you
02:31:20.720 are actually just recruiting new
02:31:22.600 consumers through novelty and losing
02:31:24.760 them as fast as you are doing it and
02:31:26.520 paying a huge amount of money to do it
02:31:28.160 and that's very very wasteful you're
02:31:30.000 saying there's no mo people switch
02:31:32.080 there's no
02:31:33.279 brand what I'm saying is you will go
02:31:35.479 from one geography to another and India
02:31:37.600 is a country you can show growth to
02:31:40.640 anyone any investor yeah but eventually
02:31:43.960 it is a repeat which counts yeah fair so
02:31:46.800 if actors don't necessarily work for
02:31:49.279 India what about social media
02:31:51.399 influencers are they a good medium to
02:31:53.520 sell alcohol yes yeah but sell alcohol
02:31:57.200 means for a brand or what for
02:31:59.600 advertisement 100% they do uh you have
02:32:02.600 to be careful on who you're investing on
02:32:05.319 and uh do your research I feel there now
02:32:07.520 apps and there are ways to actually find
02:32:09.399 out if that influence is bought or of
02:32:11.760 who that person is talking to what the
02:32:13.960 male to female Rao
02:32:16.479 is city which city they are operating in
02:32:19.520 so
02:32:20.399 you go through a agency cheaper way to
02:32:23.160 acquire consumers than than actors but
02:32:27.279 also having said that uh what
02:32:29.279 influencers also do for you is that they
02:32:31.319 are also physically present which
02:32:33.600 actually changes the game a little bit
02:32:35.240 it is kind of like the digital way of
02:32:37.840 experiencing the brand you know in the
02:32:40.120 sense that they will taste say a whiskey
02:32:41.840 and be like I find it like
02:32:44.120 Smokey also depends on the category if
02:32:46.880 the higher you go suppose you go 8
02:32:49.399 10,000 you don't need any marketing if
02:32:52.560 you Market you won't be able to
02:32:54.560 sell the only thing should be word of
02:32:58.160 mouth and PR press and the
02:33:02.279 competitions if you go highest up there
02:33:04.720 there are spirits competi what worked
02:33:06.359 for your 5 lakh rupee bottle cuz I saw
02:33:08.680 rur Jessel everything even rampur J have
02:33:11.720 done that I saw it in the Press was that
02:33:13.600 organic press yeah yeah organic cuz of
02:33:16.720 the novelty of a bottle cost absolutely
02:33:18.880 it's it's the most
02:33:21.120 expensive Pi that up
02:33:23.960 right there was a huge article that 50%
02:33:26.640 the luxury so I think the higher you go
02:33:29.240 it should be the press and you don't
02:33:31.120 need to mark it because it looks like if
02:33:33.080 you see the Bernard lvmh group I think
02:33:37.520 he's the biggest brand Creator Louis VTO
02:33:41.800 your Mo tennessy Bel all the luxury but
02:33:45.000 you don't see them Beyond a point you
02:33:46.600 don't see them advertising or Beyond
02:33:49.960 then that's a category play so if you're
02:33:51.240 in a luxury segment you will play
02:33:54.040 regular ET social influencers if you're
02:33:56.840 looking at a lower like you know we
02:33:58.120 talking about 12 to, 1400
02:34:00.920 Lev I influencers are a great thing
02:34:04.120 organically people like your product
02:34:05.920 they post yeah I mean it's also you
02:34:08.439 don't have
02:34:09.560 to now the new generation loves it they
02:34:12.479 are spending half the time on mobile
02:34:14.160 yeah yeah half the time they're on the
02:34:15.840 mobile there is a catch it has to be
02:34:18.479 spoken about yeah right
02:34:20.319 there is a flip side to this where if
02:34:22.160 you come across as a brand that is
02:34:24.200 paying for influence then people see
02:34:27.479 through it very very quickly also so let
02:34:29.960 it be organic you like Which is far
02:34:32.720 better because good people will your
02:34:35.000 relevant consumers will drink your
02:34:36.600 product and they will post about it
02:34:38.040 because today's time also to's time
02:34:40.359 industry is a big influence so for
02:34:42.000 example like I would send him to like if
02:34:44.399 I have a bar in I will tell him or if
02:34:46.479 he's in Delhi I'll be like hey come to
02:34:48.359 my bar and let's have drinks because
02:34:50.200 this is mutual appreciation good for me
02:34:53.160 is good and I always post about it it's
02:34:55.120 a thing right
02:34:57.040 like we are all talking to the same
02:34:59.399 people in the universe but there are all
02:35:01.319 of us have pockets of people who follow
02:35:03.560 you because you they think you know best
02:35:05.840 for the taste you know we'll go to
02:35:07.720 Mini's bar next timei next time you have
02:35:09.800 to make us the best cocktail and being
02:35:12.760 from the alcohol industy have at least
02:35:14.399 three cocktails so three of your best
02:35:16.279 right you should do this if you do this
02:35:19.840 this would be
02:35:21.240 insane far louder it'll be crowded
02:35:23.600 she'll be like wait in line no no we can
02:35:25.600 we can use our influence we know minaki
02:35:27.319 so she'll have a small uh but we like
02:35:29.640 crowds I send you to the CH it's very H
02:35:34.319 in so
02:35:36.800 premiumization is this a easier path for
02:35:39.520 someone starting off to hit instead of
02:35:41.600 trying to create a 1,500 rupee bottle of
02:35:45.319 whiskey should I try to create a 10,000
02:35:47.920 rupee bottle called Bangalore
02:35:51.840 I mean who's whose question is this it's
02:35:53.880 like so we all talking yeah so I'm I'm
02:35:56.359 so we are I would say creating a 10,000
02:36:00.240 rupees a bottle also takes that much
02:36:03.000 more out of you in terms of the money
02:36:05.279 the resources the whole everything you
02:36:08.000 you are raising the bar in every form
02:36:09.920 right it's like me saying I can have a
02:36:12.040 bar here and then I can have a bar in
02:36:14.439 say Dubai or London what if I buy
02:36:17.359 radical's good whiskey at 5,000 rupees
02:36:20.560 okay repackage it and call it something
02:36:22.920 else build a story and sell it for
02:36:24.479 10,000 and is a product this is It's a
02:36:26.720 good slightly different yeah good
02:36:29.359 product it depends what your goto Market
02:36:31.920 strategy is if your goal is to actually
02:36:33.840 launch the 1200 product but your go my
02:36:36.240 story will be 25-year-old boy in
02:36:38.040 Bangalore starts a liquor company
02:36:40.240 whiskey selling at 10,000 20,000 rupees
02:36:43.920 XYZ sold but you have to have something
02:36:46.160 around the whiskey why why this 10,000
02:36:52.279 I don't feel price pick a like say there
02:36:55.640 are red ants zal there are actual Reds
02:36:58.680 in actual red ANS in the whiskey no
02:37:00.800 those are gimmicks those are gimmicks
02:37:02.479 gimmicks won't take you long
02:37:04.399 you whisky is 10,000 rupees so in these
02:37:08.160 categories where you are creating a
02:37:09.840 niche you have a great product to start
02:37:12.319 with but you have a influencer someone
02:37:14.680 who has authenticity and who says this
02:37:16.840 is nichels Bangalore then it'll sell but
02:37:19.279 then they're buying into you right
02:37:21.240 they're not NE you the ini but your
02:37:23.439 product in in the long term your product
02:37:25.279 will have to be great in order to get
02:37:27.240 your second can you my real question
02:37:29.240 here is can you discern between 5,000
02:37:31.399 and 8,000 rupe
02:37:33.160 whiskey to a lay man I'm not talking as
02:37:35.840 an expert as one of you guys I'm blind
02:37:38.240 tasting a whiskey which cost 10,000
02:37:40.120 another which cost four can I
02:37:41.840 distinguish that's objective is very
02:37:43.920 subjective that's subjective but
02:37:46.399 800 10,000 you 4,000 10,000 buying
02:37:49.800 something for 4,000 adding one El I
02:37:51.640 think you can make out if you're a
02:37:52.800 whiskey person like if I am buying an
02:37:54.520 8,000 uh you know rupees bottle I will
02:37:58.080 sort of have an idea what I'm looking
02:37:59.920 for you know I might or might not uh
02:38:03.800 with full conviction no but I will know
02:38:06.240 a little bit of what I am looking for
02:38:08.319 and also again see the price price is
02:38:10.800 never the ladder that is just the ladder
02:38:13.920 so you're also talking about what type
02:38:15.479 right so there Japanese that are playing
02:38:17.080 in lower angle I'm playing is because
02:38:19.560 I'm selling it for more people will make
02:38:21.760 a natural assumption that it is not so
02:38:25.200 there is this fuzziness where you see I
02:38:27.479 I'll tell you now let us divide whiskey
02:38:29.520 in two categories either it'll be a
02:38:32.399 scotch or Indian whiskey now a scotch is
02:38:36.279 differentiated by
02:38:38.120 age and location location so 18y old
02:38:43.640 generally it sells for about about close
02:38:46.640 to about J
02:38:50.680 huh a blue label is say
02:38:53.319 18,000 now a Indian whiskey or anything
02:38:57.160 if you say that you're supplying at
02:38:59.359 10,000 what is your
02:39:01.800 USP the USP will become a worry then you
02:39:05.040 come on to a single malt single malt is
02:39:08.120 region specific it's a world malt it is
02:39:11.439 different where everything like the
02:39:13.439 wines earlier it was the French wines
02:39:15.800 which were ruling the market today you
02:39:17.640 have all the new age wines new
02:39:19.880 earlier it was only French same thing
02:39:21.680 like The Malt it was only Scottish malt
02:39:24.120 then you had the Irish whiskey the
02:39:25.359 bourban whiskey then the single malts
02:39:27.040 from Japan the Asian the cavins the now
02:39:30.040 the Indian Ms so there you can create
02:39:32.319 that differentiation with your blend
02:39:34.600 with your CK so it is like an artistic
02:39:37.279 no I'm talking about premiumization from
02:39:39.960 the you can't
02:39:43.800 do but price is an indicator of quality
02:39:46.520 and that is
02:39:47.399 a Indian whiskey he can charge say
02:39:50.479 10,000 no no you can charge anything you
02:39:52.240 want I think you know the basic idea you
02:39:55.000 have to
02:39:55.880 just I know a lot of people who go to a
02:39:59.359 bar and want to order the most expensive
02:40:01.279 thing yeah that's true that's true but
02:40:02.920 if you have a story if you have a story
02:40:04.880 there is an an 8,000 rupee scotch and a
02:40:07.840 10,000 rupee Indian whiskey that rich
02:40:09.920 person will go for 8,000 rupee Scotch I
02:40:12.000 don't know about that no baba but they
02:40:13.279 will also move they will also jump into
02:40:15.200 the next
02:40:17.319 10,000 they'll be like okay leaving
02:40:19.840 nichs brand now you have to have a in
02:40:22.479 your you have you have to have like
02:40:24.840 we've attempted where we've really got
02:40:26.640 successful where the first Indian
02:40:28.520 whiskey is at the bio Scotch level 100
02:40:31.640 rupees higher our Royal RoR is 100
02:40:33.960 rupees higher than all the competing
02:40:36.040 Brands it's selling like hot cake but
02:40:38.880 the quality the packaging the story is
02:40:41.960 better is very good do you think
02:40:45.120 patriotism as a narrative is selling in
02:40:47.680 India today if I were to create a brand
02:40:50.080 around alcohol 100% I think Indian being
02:40:53.640 a proud like always have advocated being
02:40:55.640 a proud company Indian company is the
02:40:58.160 way forward people are looking for
02:41:00.880 indianess people are proud to be Indian
02:41:03.359 like even if you see all my products
02:41:04.920 it's all indan indianness is euphemism
02:41:06.960 for like rur that 5 lakh rupe bottle has
02:41:09.760 written in Sanskrit on this that
02:41:11.920 happiness lies within so but what is the
02:41:14.960 underlying emotion that you're appealing
02:41:17.160 to when you write in Sanskrit and call
02:41:18.760 it ramp
02:41:20.359 I think like if you see the Indian
02:41:22.040 culture like if you go to New York
02:41:24.160 Indians we are underestimating our
02:41:27.080 power with what has happened in the last
02:41:29.600 decade and what is going to happen in
02:41:30.960 the next decade India from being a third
02:41:33.479 world country we are becoming a superpow
02:41:35.680 it's a translation we have to have that
02:41:39.399 uh belief in ourself yoga I was in New
02:41:43.800 York there was a yoga week or Time
02:41:45.439 Square with I'm agreeing with you so
02:41:47.399 100% indianess will say if you try to be
02:41:50.279 a foreigner try to be like the Western
02:41:53.640 Community you not different they are
02:41:55.319 better than us but Indians are better
02:41:57.439 than them I'm agreeing with you to the
02:41:59.359 extent that I will give you an example
02:42:01.680 of how the Chinese prefer Chinese
02:42:04.319 versions of different things that is the
02:42:06.600 most 0 89% is Thea margins they're the
02:42:09.920 most valuable listed company in the
02:42:12.240 world so I'm aligned with you the world
02:42:14.479 might be Del globalizing in a manner
02:42:16.800 where patriotism is sold to consumers
02:42:19.960 across the world in different
02:42:21.880 Pockets my question is rooted from to
02:42:25.160 our audience to the entrepreneur who
02:42:27.399 starting a liquor brand whatever liquor
02:42:30.520 should he make that an inherent part of
02:42:32.880 his story no no look for authentic
02:42:34.760 stories it can't be a gimmick it can't
02:42:37.240 be because see you you mentioned you are
02:42:39.479 from a certain you have to have a
02:42:42.240 passion if she started a bar it is a
02:42:44.720 passion which is speaking so there is
02:42:46.520 some something like such
02:42:49.240 the GC have been there it's fantastic or
02:42:52.920 his beard so my point that passion has
02:42:55.319 to speak the story won't S patriotism
02:42:58.160 isn't about being you have to it has to
02:43:00.840 link to the brand and and to The
02:43:02.760 Branding to the crowd that we are
02:43:04.880 talking to should we
02:43:07.080 recommend opening their company in
02:43:09.880 alcohol and Tequila mcal I know me and
02:43:12.439 abishek had long conversations about
02:43:14.439 this where you can only call it tequila
02:43:17.040 if you get this GI tag I believe
02:43:19.960 strongly In Agave based Spirit uh only
02:43:22.960 because of price point what happened to
02:43:25.479 Jin uh in India because of the import
02:43:28.600 duty if we educate if a big uh conate
02:43:32.800 comes up and pushes The Narrative a lot
02:43:35.399 of an AGA based perod because tiil La
02:43:37.720 gets very expensive to serve at a party
02:43:39.800 right if you being serving a basic Don
02:43:42.439 Julio uh Blanco in a place like Delhi
02:43:45.120 you'll be spending about 6,000 rupees a
02:43:47.240 bottle you're entertaining at home now
02:43:49.160 people are drinking tequila the way they
02:43:51.000 drinking vodka so minimum consumption
02:43:53.319 for 30 people party you're doing you
02:43:55.479 you're going to eight bottles right
02:43:58.479 there that's where what's D's brand
02:44:00.160 called pistola pistola pistola has come
02:44:02.720 in at a very good price point from go
02:44:05.600 that's from Goa uh that's from Goa
02:44:07.800 they've come at a very good price point
02:44:09.960 and I believe there is space for AA
02:44:12.439 based spirit in India if there is enough
02:44:16.479 money to educate people that okay yes
02:44:19.120 tequila is has to be blue Weber GA from
02:44:21.920 the region tequila from the region of
02:44:24.160 five six states uh but there is a space
02:44:26.760 for aav Spirit coming out of India this
02:44:28.840 folklore that tequila gives you the
02:44:30.840 least hangover no not at all it is all
02:44:34.920 all marketing all marketing so is
02:44:37.640 Hangover equally proportional to alcohol
02:44:40.800 percentage no it's also
02:44:43.319 ining when you have whiskey see every
02:44:46.680 alcohol is 42.8 basically until let you
02:44:49.359 go for a cast strength now a whiskey has
02:44:53.840 malt so it has let's take say a vodka it
02:44:59.600 is the cleanest Spirit it is triple
02:45:02.319 distilled it is six time distilled Etc
02:45:04.840 filtered so the cleanest Spirit same
02:45:07.640 thing tequila is a clean Spirit even a
02:45:09.920 Jin is a clean spirit with some herbs
02:45:12.359 and so is a rum okay explain to me what
02:45:15.439 is Hangover why do you feel a certain
02:45:17.800 way after a night of
02:45:19.760 so when you drink wine wine for example
02:45:21.800 if you drink a wine or a dark Spirit
02:45:23.479 their their talins their impurities
02:45:25.399 coners it's called congeners so which
02:45:27.439 are called impurities in a spirit you
02:45:30.640 dis yeah that's again chemical little
02:45:33.680 bit of ferment you also create higher
02:45:35.680 alcohols not just ethy alcohol you also
02:45:38.359 create more heavier alcohols which
02:45:40.640 normally in a pot or a still distill you
02:45:43.479 distill out at a lower like a height
02:45:46.479 because it's also alcohol but evaporates
02:45:48.399 so you you have something which is
02:45:50.240 called as a distiller cut so you try to
02:45:52.479 eliminate as much as high alcohol as
02:45:54.359 possible but in beer what we do that's
02:45:56.560 why beer is the hardest because you have
02:45:57.880 no room to hide you're just giving pure
02:45:59.680 fermentation so it's the hardest thing
02:46:01.520 to do because you make a mistake anybody
02:46:03.560 will catch yeah you can make something
02:46:06.439 is wrong with the beer quickly you have
02:46:08.040 to be extremely more careful in terms of
02:46:09.880 how clean you ferment these things cause
02:46:12.080 you hangover yeah so the more uh
02:46:15.080 fermentation is not balanced if your
02:46:17.359 distiller is not really like skilled or
02:46:20.160 how you are cutting it you will actually
02:46:22.399 pass on a lot more higher alcohols and
02:46:25.319 you know all these oil basically there's
02:46:28.000 a term which is called fusal
02:46:30.080 oil heav is that the same for vodka teil
02:46:34.399 wh whiskey is different because whiskey
02:46:36.120 you add malt you add BMS so it is more
02:46:39.479 like if you have a whiskey that's why if
02:46:41.319 you say when you're young basically
02:46:43.240 start from a vodka or a gin it's easier
02:46:45.359 on your pellet and aftertaste whiskey
02:46:48.920 you have to acquire that taste so it's
02:46:50.479 heavy so there if like the VMS the
02:46:53.960 wetted mold Spirit mold Spirit if that
02:46:56.319 is of low maturity then it adds that
02:46:59.520 hangover to you and also with the vka
02:47:02.760 andin it is more clean and Tequila so
02:47:05.240 which is the alcohol if I have the same
02:47:08.240 quantity will I get the least hangover
02:47:10.160 anything which is white vka I think Beka
02:47:13.120 definitely no beer hard liquor or what
02:47:16.880 well made beer of course yeah yeah or
02:47:18.560 beer
02:47:20.479 between vodka tequila rum all three of
02:47:23.439 you I think all the white AG Spirits
02:47:27.640 versus non-age so you can say AG Spirits
02:47:30.520 are difficult because of course lot of
02:47:32.920 things are adding on I'm going to
02:47:34.520 digress and ask a question one I'll come
02:47:38.359 to each of you for a second one
02:47:41.279 underrated liquor at any price point not
02:47:45.560 from your own brands that one should
02:47:47.680 drink absolutely
02:47:49.840 brand brand like they have their own
02:47:52.240 Brands she can't say oh he can't say
02:47:54.200 okay he will not name any brand start
02:47:57.040 with start with minaki one underrated
02:47:59.040 category or one underrated bottle of
02:48:02.040 alcohol underrated I feel like M M's Ry
02:48:06.800 is a great
02:48:09.240 superbly great Ry whiskey which I feel
02:48:12.800 it's it's very difficult to get your
02:48:14.120 hands on and many people don't know
02:48:16.240 about it and I feel that that's a again
02:48:18.319 that's a category uh that and that
02:48:21.040 that's a space that everybody talks
02:48:22.520 about Scotch whiskey and now there's
02:48:24.840 many other whiskies of the world I feel
02:48:27.040 that is is there space for for I to do
02:48:30.960 more interesting for me uh one of my
02:48:33.240 favorite things to drink is uh a compari
02:48:35.600 soda what Kari soda like bits is 28%
02:48:39.760 alcohol compari as a spirit a lot of
02:48:42.319 people just have it in a Negroni uh but
02:48:44.920 as a as a drink I think Kari is one of
02:48:47.240 my favorite things to drink how is it
02:48:49.200 underrated though it is underrated
02:48:51.080 because most people on a regular basis
02:48:54.439 whether it is underrated or not like
02:48:58.279 um maybe the availability is less or
02:49:00.760 what I love a glen Goen what is that
02:49:04.160 Glen Goen it's a maltt yeah Glen Coy
02:49:07.000 yeah Glen Coy gleny is 21 I love it well
02:49:11.640 awarded very well pleased but you don't
02:49:13.760 get it much India has availability
02:49:16.479 issue I think recently I tasted maybe
02:49:19.560 like an aged rum called mesma Indian rum
02:49:22.720 aged interesting effort you know in
02:49:25.000 terms of like so because there's nothing
02:49:26.359 happening on rum Indian Ram yeah and at
02:49:28.920 a premium price point I sipped at it at
02:49:31.439 bar and it was quite interesting in
02:49:33.680 terms of product I think that's yeah
02:49:36.960 because there's so much more happening
02:49:38.160 in whiskey where there's big money and
02:49:40.359 there big multinational like perno Dio
02:49:42.560 all launching their Indian malls now
02:49:44.439 it's not just Amud Paul John and um
02:49:47.120 radico it's open up quite a lot so I
02:49:50.319 think whiskies all Indian whiskies tend
02:49:52.120 to follow a certain pattern but I found
02:49:54.920 one Paul John's Christmas bold Edition
02:49:57.880 was actually a very nice Sherry oroso
02:50:00.319 cast finish this year's
02:50:02.640 phenomenal how big are prepackaged
02:50:06.960 cocktails ready to
02:50:09.439 drink non-alcoholic cocktail
02:50:13.080 mixers as an industry do you see scope
02:50:15.840 there for somebody to build in I I think
02:50:18.960 I have a very contrary opinion on Czar
02:50:21.279 in general because I think what is a
02:50:22.680 czer so you know the whole idea that us
02:50:25.279 really took off with czers now the last
02:50:27.800 three years it's Czar claw and czers
02:50:30.720 were basically Brewers who were putting
02:50:32.800 simple Ena which is extra neutral
02:50:34.840 alcohol with some sparkling water and
02:50:38.800 you know just like low calorie but if
02:50:40.840 you look at every Indian if you go to
02:50:43.040 any AATA the way every Indian is
02:50:44.960 drinking he's drinking a czar on his own
02:50:47.200 the Americans were mixing their with
02:50:48.560 whis with Coke but we in India are
02:50:50.359 anywhere mixing with soda and water so
02:50:52.600 if you going to create a cza everybody's
02:50:54.840 making their own Czar here so how are
02:50:56.600 you even it's it's so it's it's to make
02:50:59.840 something like that from a cultural
02:51:02.120 context might be relevant to us but it
02:51:04.319 will be very different in terms of
02:51:05.760 stickiness to India it's still still a
02:51:07.479 very Urban basically sells as a vodka
02:51:09.520 soda yeah I mean technically it's a
02:51:11.239 vodka soda it's anything which is but
02:51:13.120 India we drink everything on soda but go
02:51:15.520 started that right sod
02:51:18.720 so
02:51:19.640 anything food it could be what say you
02:51:22.720 whatever so it could be any flavor so
02:51:25.040 what about like pre- ready cocktail mix
02:51:27.479 oldfashioned mix thing is the the
02:51:30.359 distribution is still the same as as an
02:51:32.319 alcohol no you still have to get the
02:51:34.760 same license you still have to get the
02:51:36.319 same uh distribution you have to still
02:51:38.399 have the same retailer and at that price
02:51:40.600 point if I'm picking up a pre-made at50
02:51:43.200 rupees which not come into my house on a
02:51:45.200 blinket or swiy I have to go to a take
02:51:47.800 to pick that I rather pick up a bottle
02:51:49.920 of alcohol and mix it at home what's the
02:51:52.319 deal with wine stores across the country
02:51:54.600 do they make 10% my answer on this would
02:51:57.200 be different I think it's a slow burner
02:52:00.920 the old fashioned one right no there's
02:52:02.680 not enough players who have jumped into
02:52:05.200 this field you think there potential
02:52:07.279 here it's only bakadi who's there is
02:52:10.880 Breezers yeah okay that's the only comp
02:52:13.880 biggest Global player right
02:52:15.960 now we are talking about alcoholic or
02:52:18.080 non Al
02:52:19.399 has entered the game has
02:52:22.439 entered India H
02:52:27.239 indiaia so I think the minute
02:52:29.600 competition comes in this category can
02:52:32.279 explode because the main issue here is
02:52:35.200 the
02:52:35.960 refrigeration what happens people want
02:52:38.080 it cold the liquor shops are very the
02:52:42.279 size is very small so you give them a
02:52:45.399 fridge basically space like why beer is
02:52:47.319 not
02:52:48.960 growing
02:52:52.279 because let's let's be clear beer
02:52:55.120 drinking the premium Spirits drinking
02:52:57.399 happens at home if we go to a side car
02:53:01.080 if you have expensive whiskey and cost
02:53:03.399 4,000 rupes for a 60 ml people think
02:53:06.359 twice but the home they'll order
02:53:08.479 especially Co has changed that beer they
02:53:10.760 want to drink on the spot and that's why
02:53:12.920 refrigeration system in our liquor
02:53:15.279 stores is very less so I think the
02:53:17.920 minute that increases I think this is a
02:53:20.279 category which can explode but there
02:53:22.279 needs to be competition you need to
02:53:24.399 bring in flavors you need to bring in
02:53:27.880 the business of wine stores good
02:53:30.200 business if somebody wants to start off
02:53:32.680 I don't have too much information on
02:53:34.080 that though like Old School win
02:53:37.040 store how does it work does does it work
02:53:39.399 on 10% margin acoss has system so you
02:53:42.760 would know better on the tender system
02:53:45.040 that happens at least in see see what
02:53:47.120 happens like nowadays the uh like what
02:53:50.160 you seen in Maharashtra with the liquid
02:53:52.000 gold and everything they have
02:53:54.000 institutionalized the entire livid
02:53:56.439 living liquid is uh they have U instiz
02:53:59.840 the entire uh the
02:54:03.920 experience
02:54:06.439 but I don't know how it operates it's
02:54:09.000 not that easy but I think it's
02:54:12.000 profitable it's very profitable and uh
02:54:14.880 if you get your maths right you should
02:54:17.720 not get into a place where you go for
02:54:20.080 auctions but if you have a license
02:54:22.080 system 100% you can do a great job right
02:54:26.160 but now now but usually in G it works on
02:54:28.600 some bidding system and then actually
02:54:31.040 the store doesn't pay for for
02:54:32.640 construction they go to a Dio they go to
02:54:35.080 perno and they say this is my space turn
02:54:37.439 it around in 30 days and then it's a
02:54:39.319 full branded store of of a certain brand
02:54:42.279 but I think the opportunity also is in
02:54:44.239 very Niche products now in the wine
02:54:46.520 category because you know you can have
02:54:49.359 just craft and wine bars or like you
02:54:52.080 know Outlets which are a very specific
02:54:54.000 the license is different right it could
02:54:55.439 be the same license also give an example
02:54:58.120 like say for radico if we get an
02:55:00.200 opportunity where we can enter into a
02:55:03.439 liquor store business where it is coriz
02:55:06.720 like you know corporates can get into it
02:55:08.640 licensing is not an
02:55:10.160 issue like the Dy every state is
02:55:12.680 different so you cannot generalize the
02:55:14.359 entire country how much is duty free
02:55:17.080 cheaper than I know every state is
02:55:19.680 different but let's say Maharashtra for
02:55:21.560 example or Karnataka or Delhi what is
02:55:24.479 the price of dutyfree alcohol versus
02:55:27.000 price on ground so it depends like in in
02:55:30.359 Delhi especially in a place like GGO
02:55:32.680 alcohol is not very expensive because
02:55:34.439 your taxes are lower dutyfree also takes
02:55:37.600 a percentage of your sales which
02:55:39.239 actually now from G to dutyfree there's
02:55:41.840 not too much difference at least from
02:55:44.080 gooda to a Delhi dutyfree no you're
02:55:46.720 talking about a dutyfree say a Mumbai
02:55:49.160 and a Mumbai dutyfree airport or what
02:55:51.080 are you no no I'm talking about Mumbai
02:55:52.960 airport dutyfree versus Mumbai retail
02:55:55.279 shop yeah that so let's give an example
02:55:58.000 say rampur in the Mumbai duty free would
02:56:01.840 be
02:56:03.160 8,500 and in the retail
02:56:06.200 12,000 but delh to uh Delhi Duty fee to
02:56:09.640 Gan would not be that different comp
02:56:11.520 talking about the state versus the
02:56:13.680 dutyfree airport uh Bombay to a Bombay
02:56:16.560 Airport would be uh higher difference
02:56:18.880 versus a Delhi to a
02:56:21.120 good and online delivery of alcohol make
02:56:25.359 it happen e-commerce what is the issue
02:56:27.359 with it are some people doing it some
02:56:30.080 people not doing it so West w got a
02:56:33.399 license it's a State subject so uh say
02:56:36.520 West Bengal has agreed to it and is
02:56:38.800 making money off it which is intelligent
02:56:40.720 of them but then some online would be
02:56:43.000 what only 5% or hardly yeah but the fact
02:56:46.080 that they've made it easy for for for
02:56:48.000 all of us but
02:56:49.439 I have living liquids in Bombay also
02:56:52.080 does something uh with online delivery W
02:56:55.880 it move power away from you guys to the
02:56:58.520 large e-commerce aggregators like it
02:57:01.680 like it does for other products like
02:57:04.560 fashion okay I I'll change that what
02:57:07.680 happens like say the women they can't go
02:57:10.479 to a store so the consumers it'll
02:57:14.399 expand what margins we are giving to the
02:57:16.760 retail or for anything is the same thing
02:57:20.720 but the distribution becomes very easy
02:57:23.640 but what is to be said that Amazon
02:57:26.080 tomorrow will not start a khur instead
02:57:29.120 of rampur and push that higher up in
02:57:31.800 their algorithm see if you see glob if
02:57:34.040 you see globally H online retail when it
02:57:37.200 was covid London everywhere it was on
02:57:40.680 except India 45 days we were dry that's
02:57:43.279 why the media if you see they made a
02:57:45.520 huckus about it but anything which is
02:57:48.439 say food there would be so much of Q so
02:57:51.680 online delivery was there is prevalent
02:57:54.399 in us everywhere but as a kpur or a
02:57:58.520 nagpur or a
02:58:00.279 rampur Amazon has not been able to
02:58:02.560 deliver that because alcohol production
02:58:04.920 is very different from a commodity a
02:58:07.600 brand is different it's a luxury it's
02:58:09.720 experience you're saying if it goes
02:58:11.359 online will you go to an aggregator or
02:58:13.520 will you want to do the delivery
02:58:15.319 yourself no if I become a delivery guy
02:58:18.239 like say
02:58:20.760 Amazon but then it's a different kettle
02:58:23.279 of the logistic can happen through an
02:58:25.359 e-commerce player but brand Ming will
02:58:27.000 still happen offline of course you'll go
02:58:29.319 to an aggregator why won't you I mean
02:58:31.080 you want to open it up you would want to
02:58:33.040 open up to everybody else and why would
02:58:35.880 you not see as long as the aggregator is
02:58:37.920 making a let's say agreeable sum which
02:58:41.960 is always a point of contention with
02:58:44.680 aggregators right so if they take a
02:58:46.600 decent sum out of your business and give
02:58:49.760 you the increase your width of
02:58:51.600 distribution recy happens faster and
02:58:54.160 easier this is cash right this is retail
02:58:56.160 so this is a cash and carry situation I
02:58:58.359 mean I why would you not I think it be
02:59:01.600 fining Finance your inventory it's a
02:59:04.120 great see big biggest problem here is
02:59:05.920 legali it's like saying that anybody
02:59:08.000 above legal drinking age below legal
02:59:10.160 drinking age cannot be and then you'll
02:59:11.800 have these kids who are ordering alcohol
02:59:14.439 all of that like who was regulating the
02:59:18.600 versus the logistics like a a kid can
02:59:21.680 today order a burger but a kid cannot
02:59:23.680 order a gin there is a whole lot of you
02:59:26.720 know there would be a margin problem in
02:59:29.520 my opinion because if you give too much
02:59:31.120 power to the aggregator let's say the
02:59:32.560 Blended margin for a successful brand in
02:59:35.359 the retail is somewhere around 12 to 15%
02:59:37.680 including your trade scheme nobody goes
02:59:40.000 beyond that unless you are a very early
02:59:41.640 brand and it's a push sale that's a
02:59:43.040 completely different equation so any
02:59:46.000 Aggregate and the cost of selling liquor
02:59:48.920 at a te or a liquor outlet is very
02:59:51.359 frugal the employment structure the
02:59:53.720 salaries everything the cost of volume
02:59:55.680 versus the money invested to do that
02:59:58.160 transaction is less and it's also so
03:00:00.239 when you do the delivery model and you
03:00:02.560 start adding that extra cost I think
03:00:04.640 somewhere around you you're already
03:00:06.640 having your back towards the wall when
03:00:08.560 it comes to margins for liquor companies
03:00:10.200 if it stretches to what zomato swiggy do
03:00:12.920 or 25% then it becomes very very
03:00:15.319 unviable and that's almost like how us
03:00:18.120 large big you know box retailers operate
03:00:21.560 where they have far more leverage they
03:00:23.760 make distribution easy for you but then
03:00:26.600 it's also kind of like pregamed here you
03:00:29.399 still have a great opportunity if you
03:00:31.359 understand the Nuance of the market you
03:00:33.120 go granular you hack you play one one
03:00:35.479 one market where it's easy there's still
03:00:37.239 so many low-lying fruits I think what
03:00:39.359 happens if import Duty on foreign liquor
03:00:43.200 I read somewhere that the percentage is
03:00:45.279 going down 150 to 30 yeah can Indian
03:00:49.920 alcohol compete with International
03:00:52.279 alcohol s any kind of
03:00:55.359 Duty if it comes down to 30 it'll be
03:00:57.760 tough competition they've said no it'll
03:01:00.040 be phased to 30% over 3 years no no
03:01:03.479 right now it is 150 50% it'll come down
03:01:06.040 to 100 in one year one year next year no
03:01:09.239 that's what I don't know they're
03:01:10.479 planning or whatever it is and then in 5
03:01:12.840 Seven Years it'll come down to
03:01:14.920 50% so today also if you see Indian
03:01:17.560 production are priced higher like say
03:01:20.200 our malt is priced higher than any of
03:01:22.800 the uh the well-known malts also it's
03:01:25.960 very so price perception has become
03:01:27.640 different also what happens like lot of
03:01:29.840 Indian companies are importing lot of
03:01:32.279 scotch from outside yeah so that value
03:01:34.920 comes down straight away the profit goes
03:01:37.160 up so I think it is like it's it's good
03:01:39.800 for the economy it has to be a balanced
03:01:42.279 and it'll be healthy yeah like for for
03:01:44.359 example for bars it's it's worse for me
03:01:47.080 to buy Indian Brands versus buying
03:01:49.520 International Brands can you imagine
03:01:51.279 like this is this is so funny so I have
03:01:53.319 to buy a case minimum case is case could
03:01:56.319 be six or 12 whatever that you know your
03:01:59.439 your packaging is and you have to pay
03:02:02.520 more taxes to buy Indian Brands which
03:02:04.720 are Made in India versus I if I buy a
03:02:06.720 scotch and a gin some somewhere else I
03:02:09.160 actually why is that but because I'm
03:02:12.399 actually buying far more quantity like
03:02:14.279 my quantity in up we are done so you can
03:02:16.600 buy a bottle in Delhi you have to buy 12
03:02:19.040 bottles so buy single bottle I can't buy
03:02:21.760 single bottle of ramp if I buy I have to
03:02:23.520 buy 12 which basically means look at my
03:02:25.640 inventory so I'm sitting on 12 bottles
03:02:27.560 and I have to sell it for whenever time
03:02:29.760 whichever time it takes me to sell for a
03:02:31.680 Brands especially for super premium and
03:02:33.600 premium brand is very tough like they
03:02:35.720 come and say okay buy two and the rest
03:02:37.640 are free which is terrible for them like
03:02:39.920 as as as as makers of the brand right I
03:02:41.960 mean they don't want to give it for free
03:02:43.640 and I don't want to buy it for free I
03:02:45.720 can sell it right so it's terrible it's
03:02:47.439 terrible overall for the Indian Brands I
03:02:50.000 feel to sell in uh sell in on
03:02:53.080 trade
03:02:54.800 interesting I think we've covered
03:02:56.720 everything like can you guys think of
03:02:58.720 something a young person starting off
03:03:00.960 will need that we haven't spoken about
03:03:04.319 yet I think if you can just touch upon
03:03:06.720 like how does one go and get a um get
03:03:09.760 registered to sell in a state like I
03:03:12.920 would want to know that
03:03:14.640 myself like I've got the product made
03:03:18.000 I've got my co-packer now it's done Goa
03:03:21.279 product ready next May how do I go to
03:03:24.439 Delhi and who do I go to which
03:03:26.399 department how do I go about that
03:03:27.920 process to get my brand registered and
03:03:30.000 who do I go and
03:03:31.239 pay no no you don't have to pay anyone
03:03:34.200 it's all official but what happens
03:03:35.960 official only how do who which
03:03:37.520 department excise excise Department you
03:03:39.640 have to get your label registered like
03:03:41.479 every state has a different
03:03:44.200 and for every state by the way like like
03:03:47.479 say every state is as I said 28 states
03:03:50.520 are like 28 different countries
03:03:52.920 Karnataka you go when you register
03:03:55.319 excise will put your label for 40 days
03:03:58.279 someone if someone objects they will say
03:04:00.520 no there is a criteria once you get then
03:04:03.399 you get registered then you supply your
03:04:05.239 material go it is easier yeah go is the
03:04:08.840 easiest up then in certain states you
03:04:11.960 have to once a year the label you can
03:04:13.960 apply if you take the pricing you cannot
03:04:16.319 increase the pricing if the government
03:04:18.080 does not allow you to so every state has
03:04:20.840 a different uh uh uh
03:04:24.399 system so label has to be different for
03:04:26.760 every state No Label has to be same but
03:04:29.920 suppose if you have a different pricing
03:04:31.840 then the descriptor Etc has has
03:04:33.880 different pricing the
03:04:35.760 EDP the EDP means X distill
03:04:39.399 price okay so that has to be like
03:04:42.800 certain states have that you have to
03:04:44.160 have the lowest price the lowest EDP
03:04:46.439 it's another math wants the lowest has
03:04:49.840 always wanted the lowd wants the lowest
03:04:52.399 so they ask for it they say are we the
03:04:54.920 cheapest in India only then you can
03:04:56.920 register so you have to claim it like
03:04:58.680 and you have to actually say no I'm the
03:05:00.239 cheapest with you so it's like you going
03:05:02.479 to 10 markets and then saying I'm the
03:05:03.880 cheapest with you but so then you have
03:05:05.439 to follow through right you can't also
03:05:07.760 cheat on how can you be the cheapest
03:05:09.359 with 10 no like you or ex distiller
03:05:12.880 price let's say is 11100 for Goa but you
03:05:16.160 only have 250 R in taxation which is the
03:05:18.880 lowest then your price becomes 14450
03:05:21.680 1350 but let's say you are in Delhi and
03:05:24.000 you have to pay another 1,000 rupees
03:05:26.279 then you go 2100 so your MRP on the
03:05:29.840 consumer end will be different but you
03:05:31.520 could be cheapest in both the states at
03:05:33.239 the same time but because of the tax
03:05:35.239 because of the also the excise policies
03:05:37.200 in certain states determine that you
03:05:39.800 cannot have differential pricing in
03:05:42.040 different states they want to regulate
03:05:43.720 it to that so like for example do you
03:05:45.560 have a person in your company who does
03:05:48.000 this for you or who policies you no I
03:05:51.399 think eventually everybody learns I mean
03:05:56.040 but the state you have all the state
03:05:58.279 head it's like a it's a I'm talking
03:06:01.000 about people from Z to one like if I
03:06:03.279 want to start something I would not know
03:06:04.720 where to go to um and understand this
03:06:08.520 taxation I think you know my personal
03:06:11.080 experience has been like so when I was
03:06:14.479 just to ask a question
03:06:16.560 is to Spirits you have to be initially
03:06:20.040 is easier yeah okay and is it easier in
03:06:22.319 low ABV to Spirits huh no no it's the
03:06:25.760 same for everyone but I think you know
03:06:27.239 when you it's a government department so
03:06:29.680 you know you probably so I'll tell you
03:06:31.479 one experience of mine so when I was
03:06:33.840 just starting out and we didn't have a
03:06:35.800 policy or a license to allow you to
03:06:37.760 bottle so literally go and like you know
03:06:40.120 work with every little desk in the
03:06:42.520 excise Department from one step to the
03:06:44.439 other so I spent literally 6 months in
03:06:46.640 the Goa excise Department Department I
03:06:47.960 would go every morning after quitting my
03:06:49.920 job 9:00 to 6:00 and one day there was a
03:06:53.800 fire that broke out in that excise
03:06:55.479 office so the commissioner came out and
03:06:56.960 he did a roll call because of the
03:06:58.520 employees and he said
03:07:02.239 Brewing I've gone through all this you
03:07:04.359 know so so it is that level of you know
03:07:07.279 to you understand once you know then you
03:07:09.760 got a favorable policy which allowed you
03:07:11.560 to do it but you had to literally go and
03:07:13.720 convince people that you know you want
03:07:15.160 to do this and that's how government
03:07:17.520 departments the same thing like what
03:07:19.200 what they face in building uh products I
03:07:22.160 face that in doing events absolutely
03:07:24.399 yeah so in a place like Delhi Delhi is
03:07:26.800 great to do events good Gau for example
03:07:29.279 if I do a sale of two cres of alcohol
03:07:31.680 from an event right I have to pay 18%
03:07:34.840 vat upfront of total salable amount
03:07:38.239 beforehand to the government even though
03:07:40.200 I'm giving free stock secondly in a
03:07:42.439 place like Bangalore they cannot give me
03:07:44.720 free stock I have to physically go as a
03:07:48.319 event owner go and buy stock which will
03:07:52.080 be block of about 50 to 60 lakh rupees
03:07:54.960 of mine before the event so they and
03:07:58.920 they look they look at you like you're
03:08:00.800 doing something wrong why you picking up
03:08:03.239 600 cases of alcohol for an event what
03:08:05.720 type of event are you doing not for him
03:08:09.960 he's they look at you very differently
03:08:12.479 so whenever I go to the offices Because
03:08:14.319 by the end of a license have get taken
03:08:15.960 on my name you know when you come on
03:08:17.800 manufacturing you have hologram you have
03:08:19.680 track and Trace you have so many things
03:08:21.760 and it keeps changing it's it's like a
03:08:24.399 is duplication a big problem for you see
03:08:27.040 duplication now what has happened
03:08:30.040 is each state as you rightly said the
03:08:33.200 figure 22% of Up's Revenue everyone is
03:08:37.520 so dependent on the excise revenue and
03:08:41.040 if any state has to succeed they don't
03:08:42.800 allow duplicacy so this was a problem 15
03:08:46.000 20 years back when I started work now
03:08:48.800 it's gone minimal but you can see some
03:08:51.479 Progressive changes like absolutely
03:08:53.279 we've seen like even in Delhi everything
03:08:54.880 now that since I mean we've been
03:08:56.439 operating in Dei and it had it went
03:08:59.279 online it was great it was barcoded
03:09:01.680 everything which is like it was so much
03:09:03.640 easier for us to pick up stuff from
03:09:05.479 retail pay size and then deal with the
03:09:08.120 retailers like our life became so much
03:09:10.399 simpler detailer at a point time yeah
03:09:12.880 yeah exactly so what I'm saying is there
03:09:14.920 are really like you know small changes
03:09:17.840 which keep happening and we've seen that
03:09:19.600 over a period of time basically we
03:09:21.319 should be like the software industry
03:09:23.080 like Bangalore Karnataka where the
03:09:25.680 government didn't interfere Beyond a
03:09:27.479 point and the industry flourished so the
03:09:30.800 minute if we pay Revenue have the excise
03:09:33.359 check at the point of the factory at the
03:09:37.479 revenue and let it live open it up yeah
03:09:40.800 same thing open a bar man like 30
03:09:44.520 license sorry 30 licenses it's a lot of
03:09:47.880 licenses so I mean we know how much it
03:09:49.960 takes to
03:09:51.479 even packing you still good when you're
03:09:54.040 building your own dis the licenses are
03:09:56.319 like chemical and fire to understand one
03:09:59.840 a like on the other side like you
03:10:01.800 invting to sell food liquor can make too
03:10:04.600 much money or is it like like
03:10:06.880 a how do I say it's like
03:10:10.120 a it's like a like like the liquor
03:10:14.680 industry like people have a feeling that
03:10:17.359 you know it makes too much money or it's
03:10:19.319 very easy to make money yeah what do you
03:10:21.319 feel I don't think so the number of
03:10:23.920 brands that have shut down during covid
03:10:25.880 is Testament to how difficult it is to
03:10:28.760 make money in the liquor industry also
03:10:30.560 in the bar industry I feel very few
03:10:33.279 people make money yeah uh but the ones
03:10:36.479 who make money and succeed for a
03:10:38.439 prolonged period will continue will
03:10:40.279 probably make a lot more money which is
03:10:42.040 fair it's
03:10:43.359 capitalism right gradual distribution
03:10:45.800 exactly
03:10:47.479 I think survival of the fittest yeah
03:10:49.600 eventually yeah yeah no but isn't that
03:10:51.479 true for every every indry is that true
03:10:53.920 for every industry like you have to be
03:10:56.000 resilient okay last part of today is at
